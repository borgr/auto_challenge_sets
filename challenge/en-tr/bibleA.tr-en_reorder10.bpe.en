now the ear@@ th was form@@ less and empty . d@@ ark@@ ness was on the sur@@ face of the deep . God 's Spiri@@ t was h@@ over@@ ing over the sur@@ face of the waters .
God said , " Let the ear@@ th yield gr@@ ass , her@@ bs yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its se@@ ed in it , on the ear@@ th " ; and it was so .
the ear@@ th yi@@ elded gr@@ ass , her@@ bs yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its se@@ ed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the les@@ ser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God created the large sea cre@@ atures , and every living cre@@ ature that moves , with which the waters s@@ war@@ med , after their kind , and every w@@ ing@@ ed bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God made the animals of the ear@@ th after their kind , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , and everything that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th . "
God b@@ les@@ sed them . God said to them , " Be fruit@@ ful , multi@@ ply , fill the ear@@ th , and sub@@ due it . have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the sky , and over every living thing that moves on the ear@@ th . "
God said , " be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , which is on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , which be@@ ars fruit yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed . it will be your food .
to every animal of the ear@@ th , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , in which there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for food " ; and it was so .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
this is the history of the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens .
no plant of the field was yet in the ear@@ th , and no her@@ b of the field had yet sp@@ run@@ g up ; for Yah@@ we@@ h God had not caused it to rain on the ear@@ th . there was not a man to ti@@ ll the ground ,
out of the ground Yah@@ we@@ h God made every tree to grow that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the gar@@ den , and the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
a river went out of E@@ den to water the gar@@ den ; and from there it was par@@ ted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is P@@ ish@@ on : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Hav@@ il@@ ah , where there is gold ;
the name of the second river is G@@ ih@@ on : the same river that flows through the whole land of C@@ ush .
the name of the third river is H@@ idde@@ kel : this is the one which flows in front of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . the fourth river is the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will su@@ rely die . "
the man gave names to all li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a hel@@ per su@@ itable for him .
he made the ri@@ b , which Yah@@ we@@ h God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one f@@ les@@ h .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the gar@@ den , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a de@@ light to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desi@@ red to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
they heard the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day , and the man and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the gar@@ den .
by the swe@@ at of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are d@@ ust , and to d@@ ust you shall return . "
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed Cher@@ ub@@ s at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den , and the fla@@ me of a s@@ word which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
again she gave birth , to C@@ ain 's brother A@@ bel . A@@ bel was a keep@@ er of she@@ ep , but C@@ ain was a til@@ ler of the ground .
but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect C@@ ain and his offering . C@@ ain was very angry , and the expression on his face fell .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don '@@ t do well , sin cro@@ u@@ ches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
C@@ ain said to A@@ bel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that C@@ ain rose up against A@@ bel , his brother , and killed him .
now you are Cur@@ sed because of the ground , which has opened its m@@ outh to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you ti@@ ll the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . "
be@@ hold , you have driven me out this day from the sur@@ face of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . it will happen that who@@ ever finds me will kill me . "
C@@ ain knew his wife . she conce@@ ived , and gave birth to E@@ no@@ ch . he built a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , E@@ no@@ ch .
to E@@ no@@ ch was born Ira@@ d . Ira@@ d became the father of Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el . Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el became the father of Meth@@ us@@ ha@@ el . Meth@@ us@@ ha@@ el became the father of La@@ me@@ ch .
this is the book of the generations of A@@ dam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's lik@@ eness .
A@@ dam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image , and named him S@@ eth .
the days of A@@ dam after he became the father of S@@ eth were eight hundred years , and he became the father of sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
it happened , when men began to multi@@ ply on the sur@@ face of the ground , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wi@@ ves of all that they chose .
Yah@@ we@@ h saw that the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of man was great in the ear@@ th , and that every imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart was only ev@@ il continu@@ ally .
Yah@@ we@@ h was sor@@ ry that he had made man on the ear@@ th , and it gri@@ ev@@ ed him in his heart .
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the sur@@ face of the ground ; man , along with animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sor@@ ry that I have made them . "
this is the history of the generations of No@@ ah . No@@ ah was a righ@@ te@@ ous man , bla@@ me@@ less among the people of his time . No@@ ah walked with God .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , its b@@ read@@ th fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its he@@ ight thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
you shall make a ro@@ of in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cu@@ bit up@@ ward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h having the bre@@ ath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the ear@@ th will die .
but I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wi@@ ves with you .
of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
of the birds after their kind , of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the ear@@ th for for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the sur@@ face of the ground . "
it happened after the seven days , that the waters of the flood came on the ear@@ th .
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , on the same day all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep were bur@@ st open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
in the same day No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
they , and every animal after its kind , all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
the flood was for@@ ty days on the ear@@ th . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the ear@@ th .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the sur@@ face of the ground , including man , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the ear@@ th . only No@@ ah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , all the animals , and all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th . the waters subsi@@ ded .
the deep 's fo@@ un@@ tains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was re@@ strained .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , on Ar@@ ar@@ at 's mountains .
the waters rece@@ ded continu@@ ally until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of for@@ ty days , that No@@ ah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
the do@@ ve came back to him at evening , and , be@@ hold , in her m@@ outh was an olive le@@ af p@@ lu@@ cked off . so No@@ ah knew that the waters were ab@@ ated from the ear@@ th .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from the ear@@ th . No@@ ah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the sur@@ face of the ground was dri@@ ed .
in the second month , on the twenty @@@ -@@ @ seventh day of the month , the ear@@ th was d@@ ry .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all f@@ les@@ h , including birds , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply on the ear@@ th . "
No@@ ah built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar .
the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you will be on every animal of the ear@@ th , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground te@@ em@@ s with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will su@@ rely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you : all f@@ les@@ h will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood , neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the ear@@ th . "
I set my ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w in the cl@@ oud , and it will be for a sign of a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the ear@@ th .
and I will remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which is between me and you and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h , and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all f@@ les@@ h .
the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w will be in the cl@@ oud . I will look at it , that I may remember the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between God and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h that is on the ear@@ th . "
God said to No@@ ah , " This is the to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I have established between me and all f@@ les@@ h that is on the ear@@ th . "
S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it on both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , went in back@@ wards , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father . their faces were back@@ wards , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
now this is the history of the generations of the sons of No@@ ah and of S@@ hem , ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h . sons were born to them after the flood .
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands , everyone after his language , after their families , in their nations .
Can@@ a@@ an became the father of S@@ id@@ on ( his fir@@ st@@ born ) , H@@ eth ,
the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as you go toward Ger@@ ar , to Gaza ; as you go toward So@@ dom , G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , to L@@ as@@ ha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to S@@ hem , the father of all the children of E@@ ber , the el@@ der brother of Jap@@ het@@ h , to him also were children born .
these are the sons of S@@ hem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
it happened , as they trav@@ eled east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar , and they lived there .
they said , " C@@ ome , let 's build ourselves a city , and a to@@ wer whose top reaches to the sky , and let 's make ourselves a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad on the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " be@@ hold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be with@@ held from them , which they intend to do .
therefore its name was called Bab@@ el , because there Yah@@ we@@ h conf@@ used the language of all the ear@@ th . from there , Yah@@ we@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th .
this is the history of the generations of S@@ hem . S@@ hem was one hundred years old and became the father of Ar@@ p@@ ach@@ s@@ had two years after the flood .
now this is the history of the generations of Ter@@ ah . Ter@@ ah became the father of Ab@@ ram , N@@ ah@@ or , and Har@@ an . Har@@ an became the father of lot .
Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took wi@@ ves . the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai , and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an who was also the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , lot the son of Har@@ an , his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife . they went from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . they came to Har@@ an and lived there .
now Yah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , " G@@ et out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will b@@ less those who b@@ less you , and I will cur@@ se him who cur@@ ses you . all of the families of the ear@@ th will be b@@ les@@ sed in you . "
Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , lot his brother 's son , all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s whom they had gotten in Har@@ an , and they went to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
he left from there to the mountain on the east of Be@@ the@@ l , and pit@@ ched his tent , having Be@@ the@@ l on the west , and A@@ I on the east . there he built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h and called on the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
there was a fam@@ ine in the land . Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to live as a foreig@@ ner there , for the fam@@ ine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " Se@@ e now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
why did you say , ' S@@ he is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
to the place of the alt@@ ar , which he had made there at the first . there Ab@@ ram called on the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their sub@@ stance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of lot 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
Is@@ n '@@ t the whole land before you ? ple@@ ase separate yo@@ ur@@ self from me . if you go to the left hand , then I will go to the right . or if you go to the right hand , then I will go to the left . "
so lot chose the Pla@@ in of the Jordan for himself . lot trav@@ eled east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , nor@@ th@@ ward and sou@@ th@@ ward and eas@@ tw@@ ard and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard ,
I will make your off@@ spring as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , so that if a man can number the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , then your se@@ ed may also be num@@ ber@@ ed .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its b@@ read@@ th ; for I will give it to you . "
it happened in the days of Am@@ ra@@ ph@@ el , king of Sh@@ in@@ ar , Ari@@ o@@ ch , king of El@@ las@@ ar , Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer , king of E@@ lam , and ti@@ dal , king of Go@@ i@@ im ,
that they made war with Ber@@ a , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha , king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
they returned , and came to En Mis@@ h@@ p@@ at ( the same is K@@ ade@@ sh ) , and struck all the country of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and also the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that lived in Haz@@ az@@ on Tam@@ ar .
now the val@@ ley of S@@ iddi@@ m was full of tar p@@ its ; and the kings of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hil@@ ls .
one who had escaped came and told Ab@@ ram , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w . now he lived by the o@@ aks of Mam@@ re , the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sh@@ col , and brother of An@@ er ; and these were allies of Ab@@ ram .
when Ab@@ ram heard that his relative was taken cap@@ tive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen , and pursu@@ ed as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursu@@ ed them to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
the king of So@@ dom went out to meet him , after his return from the sla@@ ughter of Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer and the kings who were with him , at the val@@ ley of Sha@@ ve@@ h ( that is , the King 's Valley ) .
and b@@ les@@ sed be God Most High , who has delivered your enem@@ ies into your hand . " Ab@@ ram gave him a tenth of all .
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have e@@ aten , and the portion of the men who went with me : An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re . let them take their portion . "
Ab@@ ram said , " be@@ hold , to me you have given no se@@ ed : and , be@@ hold , one born in my house is my he@@ ir . "
be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your he@@ ir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your he@@ ir . "
Yah@@ we@@ h brought him outside , and said , " Lo@@ ok now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Ab@@ ram , " S@@ o shall your se@@ ed be . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t divide the birds .
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , be@@ hold , a smoking fur@@ n@@ ace , and a f@@ laming tor@@ ch passed between these pieces .
now Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , b@@ ore him no children . she had a hand@@ ma@@ id , an Egyptian , whose name was Hag@@ ar .
Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , took Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , her hand@@ ma@@ id , after Ab@@ ram had lived ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to Ab@@ ram her husband to be his wife .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h found her by a fo@@ un@@ tain of water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , by the fo@@ un@@ tain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to her , " I will greatly multi@@ ply your se@@ ed , that they will not be num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude . "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to her , " be@@ hold , you are with child , and will bear a son . you shall call his name I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , because Yah@@ we@@ h has heard your aff@@ li@@ ction .
neither will your name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but your name will be Ab@@ ra@@ ham ; for I have made you the father of a multi@@ tude of nations .
I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and you and your se@@ ed after you throughout their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God to you and to your se@@ ed after you .
this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your se@@ ed after you . every male among you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised .
you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised in the f@@ les@@ h of your fo@@ res@@ kin . it will be a to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and you .
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circum@@ c@@ ised . my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant will be in your f@@ les@@ h for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised male who is not circum@@ c@@ ised in the f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant . "
I will b@@ less her , and moreover I will give you a son by her . yes , I will b@@ less her , and she will be a mother of nations . K@@ ings of peoples will come from her . "
as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard you . be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly . he will become the father of twelve pr@@ inces , and I will make him a great nation .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house , and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the same day , as God had said to him .
he lifted up his eyes and looked , and saw that three men stood opposite him . when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself to the ear@@ th ,
the two an@@ gel@@ s came to So@@ dom at evening . lot sat in the gate of So@@ dom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bo@@ wed himself with his face to the ear@@ th ,
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of So@@ dom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
they called to lot , and said to him , " W@@ here are the men who came in to you this night ? bring them out to us , that we may have sex with them . "
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , both small and great , so that they we@@ ar@@ ied themselves to find the door .
but he lin@@ gered ; and the men gra@@ bbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ' hands , Yah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ci@@ ful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
see now , your ser@@ vant has found fav@@ or in your sight , and you have mag@@ ni@@ fied your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , which you have shown to me in saving my life . I can '@@ t escape to the mountain , lest ev@@ il over@@ take me , and I die .
see now , this city is near to flee to , and it is a little one . O@@ h let me escape there ( is@@ n '@@ t it a little one ? ) , and my sou@@ l will live . "
he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in which lot lived .
lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and lived in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he was afraid to live in Zo@@ ar . he lived in a cave with his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's se@@ ed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
but God came to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch in a dream of the night , and said to him , " be@@ hold , you are a dead man , because of the woman whom you have taken . for she is a man 's wife . "
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their e@@ ar . the men were very scar@@ ed .
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
it happened , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said to her , ' This is your kin@@ d@@ ness which you shall show to me . everywhere that we go , say of me , " He is my brother . " ' "
she said , " Wh@@ o would have said to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that Sar@@ ah would nur@@ se children ? for I have bor@@ ne him a son in his old age . "
God said to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , " D@@ on '@@ t let it be gri@@ ev@@ ous in your sight because of the boy , and because of your hand@@ ma@@ id . in all that Sar@@ ah says to you , listen to her voice . for from I@@ sa@@ ac will your se@@ ed be called .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bo@@ w shot away . for she said , " D@@ on '@@ t let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and we@@ pt .
God heard the voice of the boy . the an@@ gel of God called to Hag@@ ar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hag@@ ar ? D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and became , as he grew up , an ar@@ cher .
he lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and P@@ hic@@ ol the captain of his army spoke to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
so they made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant at Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba . A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up with P@@ hic@@ ol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
he said , " Now take your son , your only son , whom you love , even I@@ sa@@ ac , and go into the land of Mor@@ i@@ ah . offer him there for a bur@@ n@@ t offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of . "
Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose early in the morning , and s@@ add@@ led his don@@ key , and took two of his young men with him , and I@@ sa@@ ac his son . he split the wood for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Ab@@ ra@@ ham built the alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar , on the wood .
he said , " D@@ on '@@ t lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not with@@ held your son , your only son , from me . "
Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns . Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering instead of his son .
that I will b@@ less you greatly , and I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed greatly like the stars of the heav@@ ens , and like the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your se@@ ed will poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose up from before his dead , and spoke to the children of H@@ eth , saying ,
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight , hear me , and ent@@ re@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place . "
now E@@ ph@@ ron was sitting in the middle of the children of H@@ eth . E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the hearing of the children of H@@ eth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
" no , my lor@@ d , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bur@@ y your dead . "
Ab@@ ra@@ ham list@@ ened to E@@ ph@@ ron . Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , according to the current mer@@ chan@@ ts ' standard .
after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re ( that is , He@@ br@@ on ) , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were de@@ eded to Ab@@ ra@@ ham for a possession of a bur@@ ying place by the children of H@@ eth .
I will make you swe@@ ar by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en and the God of the ear@@ th , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I live .
if the woman is@@ n '@@ t willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls , of his master 's ca@@ me@@ ls , and depar@@ ted , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
he made the ca@@ me@@ ls k@@ ne@@ el down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
be@@ hold , I am standing by the spring of water . the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der .
the young la@@ dy was very beautiful to look at , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
it happened , as the ca@@ me@@ ls had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a sh@@ ek@@ el weight , and two brac@@ ele@@ ts for her hands of ten sh@@ ek@@ els weight of gold ,
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who has not for@@ sak@@ en his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness and his truth toward my master . as for me , Yah@@ we@@ h has led me in the way to the house of my master 's relatives . "
the man came into the house , and he un@@ loaded the ca@@ me@@ ls . he gave stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for the ca@@ me@@ ls , and water to was@@ h his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
he said to me , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with you , and prosp@@ er your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don '@@ t give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
be@@ hold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the ma@@ iden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " P@@ le@@ ase give me a little water from your pit@@ cher to drink , "
and she will tell me , " Dr@@ ink , and I will also draw for your ca@@ me@@ ls , " -@@ -@@ let her be the woman whom Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed for my master 's son . '
she hur@@ ried and let down her pit@@ cher from her sho@@ ul@@ der , and said , ' Dr@@ ink , and I will also give your ca@@ me@@ ls a drink . ' so I d@@ rank , and she also gave the ca@@ me@@ ls a drink .
I asked her , and said , ' whose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h b@@ ore to him . ' I put the ring on her n@@ ose , and the brac@@ ele@@ ts on her hands .
I bo@@ wed my head , and wor@@ shi@@ ped Yah@@ we@@ h , and b@@ les@@ sed Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken . "
the ser@@ vant brought out je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah . he also gave pre@@ ci@@ ous things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and d@@ rank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " S@@ end me away to my master . "
they b@@ les@@ sed Re@@ bek@@ ah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your se@@ ed poss@@ ess the gate of those who h@@ ate them . "
Re@@ bek@@ ah ar@@ ose with her ladi@@ es . they ro@@ de on the ca@@ me@@ ls , and followed the man . the ser@@ vant took Re@@ bek@@ ah , and went his way .
I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there were ca@@ me@@ ls coming .
Re@@ bek@@ ah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw I@@ sa@@ ac , she dis@@ moun@@ ted from the C@@ ame@@ l .
but to the sons of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts . he sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , to the east country .
these are the days of the years of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's life which he lived : one hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ five years .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , his sons , buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ,
now this is the history of the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ ore to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ ed@@ ar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their en@@ camp@@ ments : twelve pr@@ inces , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el : one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , the sister of Lab@@ an the Syrian , to be his wife .
there was a fam@@ ine in the land , besides the first fam@@ ine that was in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . I@@ sa@@ ac went to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to Ger@@ ar .
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will b@@ less you . for to you , and to your se@@ ed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham your father .
I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your se@@ ed all these lands . in your se@@ ed will all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ,
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was car@@ essing Re@@ bek@@ ah , his wife .
now all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped , and filled with ear@@ th .
I@@ sa@@ ac du@@ g again the wel@@ ls of water , which they had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father . for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
it happened the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had du@@ g , and said to him , " We have found water . "
when E@@ sa@@ u was for@@ ty years old , he took as wife Judi@@ th , the daughter of Be@@ eri the H@@ itti@@ te , and Bas@@ em@@ ath , the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te .
it happened , that when I@@ sa@@ ac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called E@@ sa@@ u his el@@ der son , and said to him , " My son ? " he said to him , " H@@ ere I am . "
now therefore , ple@@ ase take your weapons , your qu@@ i@@ ver and your bo@@ w , and go out to the field , and take me ven@@ ison .
make me sav@@ ory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young go@@ ats . I will make them sav@@ ory food for your father , such as he lov@@ es .
Re@@ bek@@ ah took the good clo@@ th@@ es of E@@ sa@@ u , her el@@ der son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jac@@ o@@ b , her younger son .
she gave the sav@@ ory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jac@@ o@@ b .
Jac@@ o@@ b went near to I@@ sa@@ ac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jac@@ o@@ b 's voice , but the hands are the hands of E@@ sa@@ u . "
he said , " Br@@ ing it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he d@@ rank .
he came near , and k@@ is@@ sed him . he s@@ mel@@ led the s@@ me@@ ll of his clo@@ thing , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and said , " be@@ hold , the s@@ me@@ ll of my son is as the s@@ me@@ ll of a field which Yah@@ we@@ h has b@@ les@@ sed .
let peoples serve you , and nations bo@@ w down to you . be lor@@ d over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bo@@ w down to you . Cur@@ sed be everyone who cur@@ ses you . b@@ les@@ sed be everyone who b@@ les@@ ses you . "
it happened , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b had just gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
when E@@ sa@@ u heard the words of his father , he cri@@ ed with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " b@@ less me , even me also , my father . "
I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered him , " be@@ hold , of the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th will be your d@@ wel@@ ling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your s@@ word will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k . "
the words of E@@ sa@@ u , her el@@ der son , were told to Re@@ bek@@ ah . she sent and called Jac@@ o@@ b , her younger son , and said to him , " be@@ hold , your brother E@@ sa@@ u comfor@@ ts himself about you by planning to kill you .
E@@ sa@@ u went to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took , besides the wi@@ ves that he had , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , the sister of N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , to be his wife .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
he dre@@ amed . be@@ hold , a st@@ air@@ way set upon the ear@@ th , and its top reached to heav@@ en . be@@ hold , the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h stood above it , and said , " I am Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham your father , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac . the land where@@ on you lie , to you will I give it , and to your se@@ ed .
your se@@ ed will be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your se@@ ed will all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
be@@ hold , I am with you , and will keep you , wher@@ ever you go , and will bring you again into this land . for I will not leave you , until I have done that which I have spoken of to you . "
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Be@@ the@@ l , but the name of the city was L@@ uz at the first .
Jac@@ o@@ b vowed a vo@@ w , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clo@@ thing to put on ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pil@@ lar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will su@@ rely give the tenth to you . "
he looked , and be@@ hold , a well in the field , and , be@@ hold , three f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep lying there by it . for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ loc@@ ks . the stone on the well 's m@@ outh was large .
there all the f@@ loc@@ ks were gathered . they rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the she@@ ep , and put the stone again on the well 's m@@ outh in its place .
it happened , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Lab@@ an heard the news of Jac@@ o@@ b , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jac@@ o@@ b , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . Jac@@ o@@ b told Lab@@ an all these things .
Jac@@ o@@ b said to Lab@@ an , " Gi@@ ve me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
when Le@@ ah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zil@@ p@@ ah , her hand@@ ma@@ id , and gave her to Jac@@ o@@ b as a wife .
she conce@@ ived , b@@ ore a son , and said , " God has taken away my re@@ pro@@ ach . "
it happened , when R@@ ach@@ el had bor@@ ne Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said to Lab@@ an , " S@@ end me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wi@@ ves and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multi@@ tude . Yah@@ we@@ h has b@@ les@@ sed you wher@@ ever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
I will pass through all your flock today , removing from there every spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted one , and every black one among the she@@ ep , and the spot@@ ted and spec@@ k@@ led among the go@@ ats . this will be my h@@ ire .
that day , he removed the male go@@ ats that were stre@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the female go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
Jac@@ o@@ b took to himself ro@@ ds of fresh pop@@ lar , al@@ mond , plane tree , pe@@ eled white stre@@ aks in them , and made the white appear which was in the ro@@ ds .
he set the ro@@ ds which he had pe@@ eled opposite the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ t@@ rough@@ s where the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink . they conce@@ ived when they came to drink .
Jac@@ o@@ b separated the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the stre@@ aked and all the black in the flock of Lab@@ an : and he put his own dro@@ ves apart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them into Lab@@ an 's flock .
it happened , wh@@ en@@ ever the stronger of the flock conce@@ ived , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the flock in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds ;
but when the flock were fe@@ e@@ ble , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them in . so the fe@@ eb@@ ler were Lab@@ an 's , and the stronger Jac@@ o@@ b 's .
Jac@@ o@@ b saw the expression on Lab@@ an 's face , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
if he said this , ' The spec@@ k@@ led will be your wages , ' then all the flock b@@ ore spec@@ k@@ led . if he said this , ' The stre@@ aked will be your wages , ' then all the flock b@@ ore stre@@ aked .
it happened during m@@ ating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and be@@ hold , the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap@@ ed on the flock were stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and be@@ hold , all the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap on the flock are stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led , for I have seen all that Lab@@ an does to you .
I am the God of Be@@ the@@ l , where you ano@@ in@@ ted a pil@@ lar , where you vowed a vo@@ w to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
for all the ri@@ ches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
and he took away all his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all his pos@@ sessions which he had gathered , including the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which he had gained in Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , to go to I@@ sa@@ ac his father , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
Jac@@ o@@ b dec@@ e@@ ived Lab@@ an the Syrian , in that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell him that he was running away .
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
why did you flee secre@@ tly , and dec@@ e@@ ive me , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell me , that I might have sent you away with mir@@ th and with songs , with tam@@ bour@@ ine and with har@@ p ;
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' T@@ ake heed to yo@@ ur@@ self that you don '@@ t speak to Jac@@ o@@ b either good or bad . '
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly lon@@ ged for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my go@@ ds ? "
Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now R@@ ach@@ el had taken the ter@@ ap@@ him , put them in the C@@ ame@@ l 's s@@ add@@ le , and sat on them . Lab@@ an felt about all the tent , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them .
she said to her father , " D@@ on '@@ t let my lor@@ d be angry that I can '@@ t rise up before you ; for I 'm having my period . " he searched , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find the ter@@ ap@@ him .
now that you have felt around in all my stu@@ ff , what have you found of all your household stu@@ ff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your e@@ w@@ es and your female go@@ ats have not cast their young , and I ha@@ ven '@@ t e@@ aten the r@@ ams of your f@@ loc@@ ks .
that which was torn of animals , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bring to you . I b@@ ore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
now come , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
if you aff@@ lic@@ t my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , or if you take wi@@ ves besides my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , no man is with us ; be@@ hold , God is witness between me and you . "
May this he@@ ap be a witness , and the pil@@ lar be a witness , that I will not pass over this he@@ ap to you , and that you will not pass over this he@@ ap and this pil@@ lar to me , for harm .
the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of N@@ ah@@ or , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jac@@ o@@ b s@@ wor@@ e by the fear of his father , I@@ sa@@ ac .
Jac@@ o@@ b offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Lab@@ an rose up , and k@@ is@@ sed his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and b@@ les@@ sed them . Lab@@ an depar@@ ted and returned to his place .
Jac@@ o@@ b sent mes@@ sen@@ gers in front of him to E@@ sa@@ u , his brother , to the land of Se@@ ir , the field of E@@ dom .
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " This is what you shall tell my lor@@ d , E@@ sa@@ u : ' this is what your ser@@ vant , Jac@@ o@@ b , says . I have lived as a foreig@@ ner with Lab@@ an , and stayed until now .
then Jac@@ o@@ b was greatly afraid and was dist@@ ressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the f@@ loc@@ ks , and the her@@ ds , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , into two companies ;
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your ser@@ vant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
ple@@ ase deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
you said , ' I will su@@ rely do you good , and make your se@@ ed as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every her@@ d by itself , and said to his servants , " Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space between her@@ d and her@@ d . "
he comman@@ ded the fore@@ most , saying , " When E@@ sa@@ u , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your ser@@ vant , Jac@@ o@@ b 's . it is a present sent to my lor@@ d , E@@ sa@@ u . be@@ hold , he also is behind us . ' "
he comman@@ ded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the her@@ ds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to E@@ sa@@ u , when you find him .
when he saw that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t prev@@ ail against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh , and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was strained , as he wrest@@ led .
Jac@@ o@@ b called the name of the place Pen@@ i@@ el : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
therefore the children of Israel don '@@ t eat the sin@@ ew of the hip , which is on the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , to this day , because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew of the hip .
Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , R@@ ach@@ el , and the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Wh@@ o are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has gr@@ ac@@ iously given your ser@@ vant . "
Le@@ ah also and her children came near , and bo@@ wed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with R@@ ach@@ el , and they bo@@ wed themselves .
ple@@ ase let my lor@@ d pass over before his ser@@ vant , and I will lead on g@@ ently , according to the pace of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lor@@ d to Se@@ ir . "
Jac@@ o@@ b came in peace to the city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m ; and en@@ camp@@ ed before the city .
he bought the par@@ cel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Din@@ ah , the daughter of Le@@ ah , whom she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b , went out to see the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the land .
Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , the pr@@ ince of the land , saw her . he took her , lay with her , and hum@@ b@@ led her .
now Jac@@ o@@ b heard that he had def@@ iled Din@@ ah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck in the field . Jac@@ o@@ b held his peace until they came .
and said to them , " We can '@@ t do this thing , to give our sister to one who is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ; for that is a re@@ pro@@ ach to us .
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circum@@ c@@ ised ;
then will we give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to you , and we will take your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to us , and we will d@@ well with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man di@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait to do this thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter , and he was hon@@ ored above all the house of his father .
Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
all who went out of the gate of his city list@@ ened to Ham@@ or , and to Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
they killed Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went away .
they took their f@@ loc@@ ks , their her@@ ds , their don@@ ke@@ ys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took cap@@ tive all their little ones and their wi@@ ves , and took as pl@@ under everything that was in the house .
God said to Jac@@ o@@ b , " arise , go up to Be@@ the@@ l , and live there . make there an alt@@ ar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of E@@ sa@@ u your brother . "
then Jac@@ o@@ b said to his household , and to all who were with him , " P@@ ut away the foreign go@@ ds that are among you , pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves , change your gar@@ ments .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an alt@@ ar to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jac@@ o@@ b all the foreign go@@ ds which were in their hands , and the r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz ( that is , Be@@ the@@ l ) , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an alt@@ ar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
the land which I gave to Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac , I will give it to you , and to your se@@ ed after you will I give the land . "
Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he spoke with him , a pil@@ lar of stone . he p@@ oured out a drink offering on it , and p@@ oured oil on it .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h , his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b were twelve .
the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah ( Le@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id ) : G@@ ad and As@@ her . these are the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , who were born to him in Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m .
I@@ sa@@ ac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . E@@ sa@@ u and Jac@@ o@@ b , his sons , buried him .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves from the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an : A@@ da@@ h the daughter of El@@ on , the H@@ itti@@ te ; and O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , the H@@ iv@@ ite ;
O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah b@@ ore Je@@ ush , J@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah . these are the sons of E@@ sa@@ u , who were born to him in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , his sons , his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the members of his household , with his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , all his animals , and all his pos@@ sessions , which he had gathered in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and went into a land away from his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
for their sub@@ stance was too great for them to d@@ well together , and the land of their travels co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t bear them because of their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
this is the history of the generations of E@@ sa@@ u the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites in the hill country of Se@@ ir :
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons : Eli@@ p@@ haz , the son of A@@ da@@ h , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u ; and Re@@ uel , the son of Bas@@ em@@ ath , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .
these were the sons of O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah , the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife : she b@@ ore to E@@ sa@@ u Je@@ ush , J@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of E@@ sa@@ u : the sons of Eli@@ p@@ haz the fir@@ st@@ born of E@@ sa@@ u : chief Tem@@ an , chief O@@ mar , chief Z@@ ep@@ ho , chief Ken@@ az ,
chief Kor@@ ah , chief G@@ at@@ am , chief A@@ mal@@ ek : these are the chiefs who came of Eli@@ p@@ haz in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of A@@ da@@ h .
these are the sons of Re@@ uel , E@@ sa@@ u 's son : chief N@@ ah@@ ath , chief Zer@@ ah , chief Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h , chief M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of Re@@ uel in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .

Dis@@ h@@ on , E@@ zer , and Dis@@ han . these are the chiefs who came of the H@@ ori@@ tes , the children of Se@@ ir in the land of E@@ dom .
these are the children of Zi@@ be@@ on : A@@ i@@ ah and An@@ ah . this is An@@ ah who found the hot spr@@ ings in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , as he f@@ ed the don@@ ke@@ ys of Zi@@ be@@ on his father .
chief Dis@@ h@@ on , chief E@@ zer , and chief Dis@@ han : these are the chiefs who came of the H@@ ori@@ tes , according to their chiefs in the land of Se@@ ir .
Hus@@ ham died , and Had@@ ad , the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , who struck Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his place . the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
Ba@@ al H@@ anan the son of A@@ ch@@ bor died , and Had@@ ar re@@ ig@@ ned in his place . the name of his city was Pa@@ u . his wife 's name was Meh@@ et@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Mez@@ a@@ ha@@ b .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Tim@@ na , chief Al@@ v@@ ah , chief J@@ eth@@ eth ,
chief Mag@@ di@@ el , and chief Ira@@ m . these are the chiefs of E@@ dom , according to their habi@@ tations in the land of their possession . this is E@@ sa@@ u , the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites .
for be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and be@@ hold , my she@@ af ar@@ ose and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es came around , and bo@@ wed down to my she@@ af . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have domin@@ ion over us ? " they ha@@ ted him all the more for his dre@@ ams and for his words .
a certain man found him , and be@@ hold , he was w@@ and@@ ering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the p@@ its , and we will say , ' A@@ n ev@@ il animal has dev@@ oured him . ' we will see what will become of his dre@@ ams . "
Re@@ ub@@ en said to them , " shed no blood . throw him into this p@@ it that is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , but lay no hand on him " -@@ -@@ that he might deliver him out of their hand , to restore him to his father .
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stri@@ pped Joseph of his co@@ at , the co@@ at of many col@@ ors that was on him ;
and they took him , and threw him into the p@@ it . the p@@ it was empty . there was no water in it .
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a car@@ av@@ an of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes was coming from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ices and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites who were mer@@ chan@@ ts passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
Re@@ ub@@ en returned to the p@@ it ; and saw that Joseph was@@ n '@@ t in the p@@ it ; and he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
they took the co@@ at of many col@@ ors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's co@@ at or not . "
all his sons and all his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters rose up to comfor@@ t him , but he refused to be comfor@@ ted . he said , " For I will go down to She@@ ol to my son mourning . " his father we@@ pt for him .
it happened at that time , that Ju@@ da@@ h went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was H@@ ira@@ h .
Ju@@ da@@ h said to O@@ nan , " G@@ o in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up se@@ ed to your brother . "
O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
after many days , Sh@@ u@@ a 's daughter , the wife of Ju@@ da@@ h , died . Ju@@ da@@ h was comfor@@ ted , and went up to his she@@ ep@@ s@@ hear@@ ers to Tim@@ n@@ ah , he and his friend H@@ ira@@ h , the Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite .
it was told Tam@@ ar , saying , " be@@ hold , your father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law is going up to Tim@@ n@@ ah to s@@ hear his she@@ ep . "
she ar@@ ose , and went away , and put off her ve@@ il from her , and put on the gar@@ ments of her wi@@ do@@ who@@ od .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes that had brought him down there .
Joseph found fav@@ or in his sight . he minist@@ ered to him , and he made him over@@ se@@ er over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @@@ -@@ @ built and hand@@ some .
when she saw that he had left his gar@@ ment in her hand , and had run outside ,
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ser@@ vant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mo@@ ck me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your ser@@ vant did to me , " that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yah@@ we@@ h was with Joseph , and showed kin@@ d@@ ness to him , and gave him fav@@ or in the sight of the keep@@ er of the prison .
the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er off@@ ended their lor@@ d , the king of Egypt .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dre@@ amed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , be@@ hold , a v@@ ine was in front of me ,
and in the v@@ ine were three branches . it was as though it bud@@ ded , it b@@ los@@ so@@ med , and its clu@@ sters produced ri@@ pe grap@@ es .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand ; and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand . "
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , the way you did when you were his c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . "
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head from off you , and will han@@ g you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your f@@ les@@ h from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the head of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven c@@ attle , sle@@ ek and f@@ at , and they f@@ ed in the mar@@ sh gr@@ ass .
be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them out of the river , ug@@ ly and th@@ in , and stood by the other c@@ attle on the br@@ ink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ ic@@ ians and wise men . P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dre@@ ams , but there was no one who could interpre@@ t them to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
we dre@@ amed a dream in one night , I and he . we dre@@ amed each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent and called Joseph , and they brought him has@@ ti@@ ly out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . he sha@@ ved himself , changed his clo@@ thing , and came in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said to Joseph , " I have dre@@ amed a dream , and there is no one who can interpre@@ t it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpre@@ t it . "
and be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven c@@ attle , f@@ at and sle@@ ek . they f@@ ed in the mar@@ sh gr@@ ass ,
and be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them , poor and very ug@@ ly and th@@ in , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ug@@ lin@@ ess .
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be known that they had e@@ aten them , but they were still ug@@ ly , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
and be@@ hold , seven heads of gra@@ in , with@@ ered , th@@ in , and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them .
the th@@ in heads of gra@@ in sw@@ allowed up the seven good heads of gra@@ in . I told it to the mag@@ ic@@ ians , but there was no one who could explain it to me . "
the seven th@@ in and ug@@ ly c@@ attle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of gra@@ in b@@ lasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of fam@@ ine .
that is the thing which I spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h . what God is about to do he has shown to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that fam@@ ine which follows ; for it will be very gri@@ ev@@ ous .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint over@@ se@@ ers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up gra@@ in under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not per@@ ish through the fam@@ ine . "
the thing was good in the eyes of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the eyes of all his servants .
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the th@@ r@@ one I will be greater than you . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said to Joseph , " be@@ hold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in rob@@ es of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of fam@@ ine came , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era pri@@ est of On , b@@ ore to him .
Joseph called the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my to@@ il , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of plenty , that were in the land of Egypt , came to an end .
the seven years of fam@@ ine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was fam@@ ine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the fam@@ ine was over all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . the fam@@ ine was severe in the land of Egypt .
he said , " be@@ hold , I have heard that there is gra@@ in in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
but Jac@@ o@@ b di@@ d@@ n '@@ t send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " L@@ est perhaps harm happen to him . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bo@@ wed themselves down to him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
by this you shall be tested . by the life of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered them , saying , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I tell you , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t sin against the child , ' and you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ? therefore also , be@@ hold , his blood is required . "
he turned himself away from them , and we@@ pt . then he returned to them , and spoke to them , and took Simeon from among them , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with gra@@ in , and to restore each man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his don@@ key food in the lo@@ d@@ ging place , he saw his money . be@@ hold , it was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack .
they came to Jac@@ o@@ b their father , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
" the man , the lor@@ d of the land , spoke roughly with us , and took us for sp@@ ies of the country .
the man , the lor@@ d of the land , said to us , ' By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take gra@@ in for the fam@@ ine of your houses , and go your way .
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not sp@@ ies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that be@@ hold , each man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , said to them , " You have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Simeon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
it happened , when they had e@@ aten up the gra@@ in which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " G@@ o again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
Ju@@ da@@ h said to Israel , his father , " S@@ end the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
I 'll be col@@ lateral for him . from my hand will you require him . if I don '@@ t bring him to you , and set him before you , then let me bear the blame fore@@ ver ,
and take double money in your hand , and take back the money that was returned in the m@@ outh of your s@@ acks . perhaps it was an over@@ sight .
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
when we came to the lo@@ d@@ ging place , we opened our s@@ acks , and be@@ hold , each man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they was@@ hed their feet . he gave their don@@ ke@@ ys fo@@ d@@ der .
when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bo@@ wed themselves down to him to the ear@@ th .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans don '@@ t eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
they sat before him , the fir@@ st@@ born according to his birth@@ right , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men mar@@ v@@ eled one with another .
he comman@@ ded the ste@@ ward of his house , saying , " fill the men 's s@@ acks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
put my c@@ up , the silver c@@ up , in the s@@ ack 's m@@ outh of the youngest , with his gra@@ in money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their don@@ ke@@ ys .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we ste@@ al silver or gold out of your lor@@ d 's house ?
with who@@ mev@@ er of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lor@@ d 's bon@@ d@@ servants . "
he said , " F@@ ar be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the c@@ up is found , he will be my bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near to him , and said , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase let your ser@@ vant speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and don '@@ t let your an@@ ger bur@@ n against your ser@@ vant ; for you are even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
we said to my lor@@ d , ' The boy can '@@ t leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can '@@ t go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " su@@ rely he is torn in pieces " ; and I ha@@ ven '@@ t seen him since .
for your ser@@ vant became col@@ lateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don '@@ t bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father fore@@ ver . '
now therefore , ple@@ ase let your ser@@ vant stay instead of the boy , a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant to my lor@@ d ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy is@@ n '@@ t with me ? -@@ -@@ lest I see the ev@@ il that will come on my father . "
then Joseph co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cri@@ ed , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a re@@ mn@@ ant in the ear@@ th , and to save you alive by a great deliver@@ ance .
so now it was@@ n '@@ t you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , lor@@ d of all his house , and ru@@ ler over all the land of Egypt .
hur@@ ry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lor@@ d of all Egypt . come down to me . D@@ on '@@ t wait .
you shall d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your f@@ loc@@ ks , your her@@ ds , and all that you have .
you shall tell my father of all my gl@@ ory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hur@@ ry and bring my father down here . "
the report of it was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the f@@ at of the land . '
now you are comman@@ ded : do this . take w@@ ag@@ ons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wi@@ ves , and bring your father , and come .
he sent the following to his father : ten don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with gra@@ in and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they depar@@ ted . he said to them , " Se@@ e that you don '@@ t quar@@ rel on the way . "
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , revi@@ ved .
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
they took their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egyp@@ t@@ -@@ -@@ Jac@@ o@@ b , and all his se@@ ed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b and his sons : Re@@ ub@@ en , Jac@@ o@@ b 's fir@@ st@@ born .
these are the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah , his daughter , and these she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b , even six@@ teen so@@ ul@@ s .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era , pri@@ est of On , b@@ ore to him .
these are the sons of Bil@@ ha@@ h , whom Lab@@ an gave to R@@ ach@@ el , his daughter , and these she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b : all the so@@ ul@@ s were seven .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s . all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , who came into Egypt , were sev@@ enty .
he sent Ju@@ da@@ h before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Gos@@ h@@ en , and they came into the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
Joseph prepared his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Gos@@ h@@ en . he presented himself to him , and fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
these men are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , for they have been ke@@ epers of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and they have brought their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have . '
that you shall say , ' Y@@ our servants have been ke@@ epers of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck from our youth even until now , both we , and our fa@@ thers : ' that you may d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; for every she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
then Joseph went in and told P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their f@@ loc@@ ks , their her@@ ds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and be@@ hold , they are in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en . "
they said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pas@@ ture for your servants ' f@@ loc@@ ks . for the fam@@ ine is severe in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . now therefore , ple@@ ase let your servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the gra@@ in which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans came to Joseph , and said , " Gi@@ ve us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
they brought their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the her@@ ds , and for the don@@ ke@@ ys : and he f@@ ed them with bread in exchange for all their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck for that year .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
it will happen at the har@@ v@@ ests , that you shall give a fifth to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts will be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h should have the fifth . only the land of the pri@@ ests alone di@@ d@@ n '@@ t become P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they got themselves pos@@ sessions there@@ in , and were fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ p@@ lied exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
Jac@@ o@@ b lived in the land of Egypt se@@ ven@@ teen years . so the days of Jac@@ o@@ b , the years of his life , were one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
but when I sle@@ ep with my fa@@ thers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bur@@ y me in their bur@@ ying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
and said to me , ' be@@ hold , I will make you fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your se@@ ed after you for an ever@@ lasting possession . '
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yo@@ urs . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
as for me , when I came from Pad@@ dan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when there was still some distance to come to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath , and I buried her there in the way to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ( the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ) . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see . he brought them near to him ; and he k@@ is@@ sed them , and embrac@@ ed them .
Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stret@@ ched out his right hand , and laid it on E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , gui@@ ding his hands know@@ ingly , for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
the an@@ gel who has re@@ deemed me from all ev@@ il , b@@ less the la@@ ds , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fa@@ thers Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac . let them grow into a multi@@ tude in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th . "
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it disp@@ le@@ ased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Am@@ or@@ ite with my s@@ word and with my bo@@ w . "
Jac@@ o@@ b called to his sons , and said : " gather yo@@ ur@@ selves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
bo@@ iling over as water , you shall not exc@@ el ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then def@@ iled it . he went up to my cou@@ ch .
my sou@@ l , don '@@ t come into their council . my gl@@ ory , don '@@ t be united to their assembly ; for in their an@@ ger they killed men . in their self @@@ -@@ @ will they ham@@ str@@ ung c@@ attle .
Cur@@ sed be their an@@ ger , for it was fierce ; and their wr@@ ath , for it was cru@@ el . I will divide them in Jac@@ o@@ b , and sc@@ at@@ ter them in Israel .
" Ju@@ da@@ h , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the nec@@ k of your enem@@ ies . your father 's sons will bo@@ w down before you .
Ju@@ da@@ h is a lion 's cu@@ b . from the pre@@ y , my son , you have gone up . he sto@@ op@@ ed down , he cro@@ u@@ ched as a lion , as a li@@ on@@ ess . who will ro@@ use him up ?
the scep@@ ter will not de@@ part from Ju@@ da@@ h , nor the ru@@ ler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obe@@ di@@ ence of the peoples be .
binding his fo@@ al to the v@@ ine , his don@@ key 's col@@ t to the choice v@@ ine ; he has was@@ hed his gar@@ ments in wine , his rob@@ es in the blood of grap@@ es .
" Ze@@ bul@@ un will d@@ well at the ha@@ ven of the sea . he will be for a ha@@ ven of ships . his border will be on S@@ id@@ on .
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleas@@ ant . he bo@@ ws his sho@@ ul@@ der to the burden , and becomes a ser@@ vant doing forced la@@ bor .
but his bo@@ w remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b , ( from there is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel ) ,
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , who will b@@ less you , with b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of heav@@ en above , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the deep that lies below , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the bre@@ asts , and of the w@@ om@@ b .
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , above the boundaries of the ancient hil@@ ls . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the cro@@ wn of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and b@@ les@@ sed them . he b@@ les@@ sed everyone according to his b@@ les@@ sing .
when Jac@@ o@@ b made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
when the days of we@@ eping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , " If now I have found fav@@ or in your eyes , ple@@ ase speak in the e@@ ars of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying ,
Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father ; and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , they left in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
they came to the th@@ res@@ hing floor of A@@ ta@@ d , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamen@@ ted with a very great and severe lament@@ ation . he mour@@ ned for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field , for a possession of a bur@@ ial site , from E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
as for you , you meant ev@@ il against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
Joseph saw E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's children to the third generation . the children also of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , were born on Joseph 's k@@ ne@@ es .
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they em@@ bal@@ med him , and he was put in a co@@ ff@@ in in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jac@@ o@@ b ) :
the children of Israel were fruit@@ ful , and increased ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and multi@@ p@@ lied , and grew exce@@ ed@@ ingly m@@ igh@@ ty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they aff@@ lic@@ ted them , the more they multi@@ p@@ lied and the more they spread out . they were gri@@ ev@@ ed because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mort@@ ar and in bri@@ ck , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ru@@ th@@ les@@ s@@ ly made them serve .
the king of Egypt spoke to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of whom the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah ,
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them on the birth st@@ ool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ y@@ ru@@ s bas@@ ket for him , and co@@ ated it with tar and with pit@@ ch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
she opened it , and saw the child , and be@@ hold , the baby cri@@ ed . she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , " This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children . "
it happened in those days , when Mos@@ es had grown up , that he went out to his brothers , and looked at their bur@@ den@@ s . he saw an Egyptian striking a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his brothers .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
he went out the second day , and be@@ hold , two men of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws were fighting with each other . he said to him who did the wrong , " Wh@@ y do you strike your fellow ? "
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to kill Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed because of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up to God because of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
now Mos@@ es was keeping the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro , his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , and he led the flock to the back of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and came to God 's mountain , to Ho@@ re@@ b .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to him in a fla@@ me of fire out of the mid@@ st of a b@@ ush . he looked , and be@@ hold , the b@@ ush burned with fire , and the b@@ ush was not consu@@ med .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . " Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the op@@ pression with which the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Mos@@ es said to God , " Wh@@ o am I , that I should go to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
Mos@@ es said to God , " be@@ hold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fa@@ thers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
God said to Mos@@ es , " I AM WHO I AM , " and he said , " You shall tell the children of Israel this : ' I AM has sent me to you . ' "
God said moreover to Mos@@ es , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , has sent me to you . ' this is my name fore@@ ver , and this is my memorial to all generations .
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the aff@@ li@@ ction of Egypt to the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey . " '
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my won@@ ders which I will do in its mid@@ st , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people fav@@ or in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @@@ -@@ @ handed .
but every woman shall ask of her neigh@@ bor , and of her who visits her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand , and take it by the ta@@ il . " he stret@@ ched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a ro@@ d in his hand .
Yah@@ we@@ h said furthermore to him , " Now put your hand inside your clo@@ ak . " he put his hand inside his clo@@ ak , and when he took it out , be@@ hold , his hand was le@@ pro@@ us , as white as snow .
he said , " P@@ ut your hand inside your clo@@ ak again . " he put his hand inside his clo@@ ak again , and when he took it out of his clo@@ ak , be@@ hold , it had turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it on the d@@ ry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the d@@ ry land . "
you shall speak to him , and put the words in his m@@ outh . I will be with your m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what you shall do .
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a m@@ outh , and you will be to him as God .
Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them on a don@@ key , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Mos@@ es took God 's ro@@ d in his hand .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " When you go back into Egypt , see that you do before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h all the won@@ ders which I have put in your hand , but I will har@@ den his heart and he will not let the people go .
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . be@@ hold , I will kill your son , your fir@@ st@@ born . ' "
the people believed , and when they heard that Yah@@ we@@ h had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
after@@ ward Mos@@ es and Aaron came , and said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . ' "
let he@@ avier work be laid on the men , that they may la@@ bor there@@ in ; and don '@@ t let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h says : ' I will not give you stra@@ w .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Wh@@ y ha@@ ven '@@ t you fulfilled your qu@@ ota both yes@@ ter@@ day and today , in making bri@@ ck as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cri@@ ed to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , " Wh@@ y do you deal this way with your servants ?
no stra@@ w is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Mak@@ e bri@@ ck ! ' and be@@ hold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not dimin@@ ish anything from your daily qu@@ ota of bri@@ cks ! "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Now you shall see what I will do to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , for by a strong hand he shall let them go , and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land . "
I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their travels , in which they lived as ali@@ ens .
moreover I have heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge , and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
I will bring you into the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to give to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b ; and I will give it to you for a heritage : I am Yah@@ we@@ h . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses . the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en the fir@@ st@@ born of Israel : Han@@ o@@ ch , and Pal@@ lu , H@@ ez@@ ron , and Car@@ mi ; these are the families of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the sons of Simeon : J@@ em@@ uel , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations : Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari ; and the years of the life of L@@ evi were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h : Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el ; and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she b@@ ore him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el as his wife ; and she b@@ ore him Ph@@ ine@@ has . these are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Mos@@ es , to whom Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Br@@ ing out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
" when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h speaks to you , saying , ' perform a mir@@ acle ! ' then you shall tell Aaron , ' T@@ ake your ro@@ d , and cast it down before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that it become a ser@@ p@@ ent . ' "
Mos@@ es and Aaron went in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and they did so , as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded : and Aaron cast down his ro@@ d before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and before his servants , and it became a ser@@ p@@ ent .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h also called for the wise men and the sor@@ cer@@ ers . they also , the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , did the same thing with their en@@ chan@@ tments .
go to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning . be@@ hold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " In this you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I will strike with the ro@@ d that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become f@@ oul ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall lo@@ a@@ the to drink water from the river . " ' "
Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became f@@ oul , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt did the same thing with their en@@ chan@@ tments ; and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart was har@@ dened , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h turned and went into his house , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t even take this to heart .
and the river shall s@@ warm with fro@@ gs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bed@@ room , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ov@@ ens , and into your k@@ ne@@ ading t@@ rough@@ s :
and the fro@@ gs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " T@@ ell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand with your ro@@ d over the rivers , over the stre@@ ams , and over the po@@ ols , and cause fro@@ gs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the fro@@ gs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
the fro@@ gs shall de@@ part from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Yah@@ we@@ h did according to the word of Mos@@ es , and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
but when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that there was a res@@ p@@ ite , he har@@ dened his heart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to them , as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
they did so ; and Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and struck the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; be@@ hold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yah@@ we@@ h says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if you will not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
I will set apart in that day the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , in which my people d@@ well , that no s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h did so ; and there came gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies .
Yah@@ we@@ h did according to the word of Mos@@ es , and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
be@@ hold , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h is on your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which are in the field , on the hor@@ ses , on the don@@ ke@@ ys , on the ca@@ me@@ ls , on the her@@ ds , and on the f@@ loc@@ ks with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make a distinc@@ tion between the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Israel and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h did that thing on the next day ; and all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt died , but of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the children of Israel , not one died .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not so much as one of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . but the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was st@@ ub@@ born , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t let the people go .
it shall become small d@@ ust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a bo@@ il breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the fur@@ n@@ ace , and stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it up toward the sky ; and it became a bo@@ il breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and tell him , ' This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for this time I will send all my plagu@@ es against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
for now I would have stret@@ ched out my hand , and struck you and your people with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and you would have been cut off from the ear@@ th ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th ;
be@@ hold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
those who fear@@ ed the word of Yah@@ we@@ h among the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h made their servants and their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck flee into the houses .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be ha@@ il in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his ro@@ d toward the heav@@ ens , and Yah@@ we@@ h sent Th@@ under , ha@@ il , and ligh@@ t@@ ning f@@ las@@ hed down to the ear@@ th . Yah@@ we@@ h ra@@ ined ha@@ il on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe ha@@ il , and ligh@@ t@@ ning mixed with the ha@@ il , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the ha@@ il struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the ha@@ il struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
only in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , where the children of Israel were , there was no ha@@ il .
Mos@@ es said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yah@@ we@@ h . the th@@ unders shall ce@@ ase , neither shall there be any more ha@@ il ; that you may know that the ear@@ th is Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
Mos@@ es went out of the city from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and spread abroad his hands to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the th@@ unders and ha@@ il ce@@ ased , and the rain was not p@@ oured on the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " G@@ o in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , for I have har@@ dened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their mid@@ st ,
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . "
Mos@@ es and Aaron went in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said to him , " This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , says : ' how long will you refuse to hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ self before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , be@@ hold , tomorrow I will bring loc@@ ust@@ s into your country ,
and they shall cover the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , so that one won '@@ t be able to see the ear@@ th . they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which gro@@ ws for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; as neither your fa@@ thers nor your fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were on the ear@@ th to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
Mos@@ es said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , with our f@@ loc@@ ks and with our her@@ ds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yah@@ we@@ h . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the loc@@ ust@@ s , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the ha@@ il has left . "
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very gri@@ ev@@ ous . before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
Yah@@ we@@ h turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the loc@@ ust@@ s , and dro@@ ve them into the Red Sea . there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the borders of Egypt .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness in all the land of Egypt three days .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their d@@ wel@@ lings .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ et one pla@@ gue more will I bring on P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will su@@ rely th@@ rust you out altogether .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let them ask every man of his neigh@@ bor , and every woman of her neigh@@ bor , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold . "
Yah@@ we@@ h gave the people fav@@ or in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . moreover the man Mos@@ es was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who s@@ its on his th@@ r@@ one , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female ser@@ vant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a do@@ g won '@@ t even bar@@ k or move its ton@@ gue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yah@@ we@@ h makes a distinc@@ tion between the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bo@@ w down themselves to me , saying , " G@@ et out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in hot an@@ ger .
speak to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , a lam@@ b for a household ;
your lam@@ b shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h , a male a year old . you shall take it from the she@@ ep , or from the go@@ ats :
and you shall keep it until the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two do@@ or@@ posts and on the lin@@ tel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the f@@ les@@ h in that night , ro@@ asted with fire , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . they shall eat it with bitter her@@ bs .
D@@ on '@@ t eat it raw , nor bo@@ iled at all with water , but ro@@ asted with fire ; with its head , its leg@@ s and its in@@ ner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall bur@@ n with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in has@@ te : it is Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the go@@ ds of Egypt I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments : I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
" ' seven days you shall eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; even the first day you shall put away ye@@ ast out of your houses , for who@@ ever e@@ ats le@@ av@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance fore@@ ver .
there shall be no ye@@ ast found in your houses for seven days , for who@@ ever e@@ ats that which is le@@ av@@ ened , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a foreig@@ ner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ in , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two do@@ or@@ posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ in ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will pass through to strike the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he sees the blood on the lin@@ tel , and on the two do@@ or@@ posts , Yah@@ we@@ h will pass over the door , and will not allow the destro@@ yer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and spar@@ ed our houses . ' " the people bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es and Aaron , so they did .
it happened at midnight , that Yah@@ we@@ h struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who sat on his th@@ r@@ one to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive who was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in has@@ te , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they asked of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yah@@ we@@ h went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yah@@ we@@ h for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yah@@ we@@ h , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
but every man 's ser@@ vant who is bought for money , when you have circum@@ c@@ ised him , then shall he eat of it .
in one house shall it be e@@ aten ; you shall not carry out anything of the f@@ les@@ h abroad out of the house ; neither shall you break a bone of it .
Mos@@ es said to the people , " Re@@ member this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ; for by strength of hand Yah@@ we@@ h brought you out from this place . no le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten .
it shall be , when Yah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give you , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
Un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten throughout the seven days ; and no le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall ye@@ ast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yah@@ we@@ h did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Yah@@ we@@ h may be in your m@@ outh ; for with a strong hand Yah@@ we@@ h has brought you out of Egypt .
" it shall be , when Yah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , as he s@@ wor@@ e to you and to your fa@@ thers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yah@@ we@@ h all that opens the w@@ om@@ b , and every fir@@ st@@ born which you have that comes from an animal . the mal@@ es shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
every fir@@ st@@ born of a don@@ key you shall re@@ de@@ em with a lam@@ b ; and if you will not re@@ de@@ em it , then you shall break its nec@@ k ; and you shall re@@ de@@ em all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among your sons .
it shall be , when your son asks you in time to come , saying , ' What is this ? ' that you shall tell him , ' By strength of hand Yah@@ we@@ h brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
but God led the people around by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Mos@@ es took the b@@ ones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swe@@ ar , saying , " God will su@@ rely visit you , and you shall carry up my b@@ ones away from here with you . "
they took their journey from Suc@@ co@@ th , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Eth@@ am , in the edge of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
Yah@@ we@@ h went before them by day in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
the pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud by day , and the pil@@ lar of fire by night , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from before the people .
I will har@@ den P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , and he will follow after them ; and I will get hon@@ or over P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and over all his armies ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . " they did so .
Yah@@ we@@ h har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were mar@@ ching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
they said to Mos@@ es , " Bec@@ ause there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ? why have you treated us this way , to bring us out of Egypt ?
Is@@ n '@@ t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Le@@ ave us alone , that we may serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , than that we should die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . "
Mos@@ es said to the people , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . stand still , and see the sal@@ vation of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he will work for you today : for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
lift up your ro@@ d , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the mid@@ st of the sea on d@@ ry ground .
I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself hon@@ or over P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and over all his armies , over his char@@ i@@ ots , and over his hor@@ se@@ men .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and Yah@@ we@@ h caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed , and went in after them into the mid@@ st of the sea : all of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hor@@ ses , his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yah@@ we@@ h looked out on the Egyptian army through the pil@@ lar of fire and of cl@@ oud , and conf@@ used the Egyptian army .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it . Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men , even all P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Mos@@ es and the children of Israel san@@ g this song to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " I will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h , for he has tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously . the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der he has thrown into the sea .
Y@@ ah is my strength and song . he has become my sal@@ vation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
in the gre@@ at@@ ness of your exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wr@@ ath . it consu@@ mes them as st@@ ub@@ ble .
with the blast of your nos@@ tr@@ ils , the waters were p@@ iled up . the floods stood u@@ pri@@ ght as a he@@ ap . the deep@@ s were con@@ ge@@ aled in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will over@@ take . I will divide the sp@@ oil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my s@@ word , my hand shall destroy them . '
" you , in your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , have led the people that you have re@@ deemed . you have gui@@ ded them in your strength to your hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
then the chiefs of E@@ dom were dis@@ may@@ ed . Tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling takes hold of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b . all the inhabitants of Can@@ a@@ an are mel@@ ted away .
terror and dre@@ ad falls on them . by the gre@@ at@@ ness of your arm they are as still as a st@@ on@@ e@@ -- until your people pass over , Yah@@ we@@ h , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inher@@ it@@ ance , the place , Yah@@ we@@ h , which you have made for yo@@ ur@@ self to d@@ well in ; the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the hor@@ ses of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and Yah@@ we@@ h brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
Mi@@ ri@@ am the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the sister of Aaron , took a tam@@ bour@@ ine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tam@@ bour@@ ines and with dan@@ ces .
Mos@@ es led Israel on@@ ward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and found no water .
then he cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h . Yah@@ we@@ h showed him a tree , and he threw it into the waters , and the waters were made swe@@ et . there he made a statute and an ordin@@ ance for them , and there he tested them ;
they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ;
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Mos@@ es and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yah@@ we@@ h has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the cl@@ oud .
" I have heard the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel . speak to them , saying , ' At evening you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God . ' "
it happened at evening that qu@@ ail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , be@@ hold , on the sur@@ face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness was a small round thing , small as the F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know what it was . Mos@@ es said to them , " It is the bread which Yah@@ we@@ h has given you to eat . "
when they meas@@ ured it with an O@@ mer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to Mos@@ es , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and became f@@ oul : and Mos@@ es was angry with them .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for each one , and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
they laid it up until the morning , as Mos@@ es asked , and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t become f@@ oul , neither was there any wor@@ m in it .
be@@ hold , because Yah@@ we@@ h has given you the Sab@@ b@@ ath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel trav@@ eled from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , by their jour@@ neys , according to Yah@@ we@@ h 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
the people were thir@@ st@@ y for water there ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es , and said , " Wh@@ y have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck with thir@@ st ? "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Wal@@ k on before the people , and take the el@@ ders of Israel with you , and take the ro@@ d in your hand with which you struck the N@@ ile , and go .
be@@ hold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Ho@@ re@@ b . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Mos@@ es did so in the sight of the el@@ ders of Israel .
so Jos@@ hua did as Mos@@ es had told him , and fought with A@@ mal@@ ek ; and Mos@@ es , Aaron , and H@@ ur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed ; and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " W@@ r@@ ite this for a memorial in a book , and re@@ hear@@ se it in the e@@ ars of Jos@@ hua : that I will ut@@ ter@@ ly blo@@ t out the memory of A@@ mal@@ ek from under the sky . "
now J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , how that Yah@@ we@@ h had brought Israel out of Egypt .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , came with his sons and his wife to Mos@@ es into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where he was en@@ camp@@ ed , at the Mountain of God .
Mos@@ es went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bo@@ wed and k@@ is@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Mos@@ es told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Yah@@ we@@ h had done to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , all the hard@@ ships that had come on them on the way , and how Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them .
J@@ eth@@ ro re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the Go@@ od@@ ness which Yah@@ we@@ h had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
J@@ eth@@ ro said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God . Aaron came with all of the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law before God .
you will su@@ rely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yo@@ ur@@ self alone .
you shall te@@ ach them the stat@@ utes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God : men of truth , h@@ ating un@@ just gain ; and place such over them , to be rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God comman@@ ds you so , then you will be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
Mos@@ es chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
when they had depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and had come to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , they en@@ camp@@ ed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel en@@ camp@@ ed before the mountain .
Mos@@ es went up to God , and Yah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel :
'@@ You have seen what I did to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and how I b@@ ore you on e@@ ag@@ les ' w@@ ings , and brought you to myself .
now therefore , if you will indeed obe@@ y my voice , and keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the ear@@ th is mine ;
you shall set bo@@ unds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don '@@ t go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . who@@ ever tou@@ ches the mountain shall be su@@ rely put to death .
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were th@@ unders and ligh@@ t@@ nings , and a th@@ ick cl@@ oud on the mountain , and the sound of an exce@@ ed@@ ingly l@@ oud tr@@ ump@@ et ; and all the people who were in the camp tre@@ m@@ b@@ led .
Yah@@ we@@ h came down on Mount S@@ ina@@ i , to the top of the mountain . Yah@@ we@@ h called Mos@@ es to the top of the mountain , and Mos@@ es went up .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " G@@ o down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don '@@ t let the pri@@ ests and the people break through to come up to Yah@@ we@@ h , lest he break forth on them . "
" I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
" you shall not make for yo@@ ur@@ selves an i@@ dol , nor any image of anything that is in the heav@@ ens above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
you shall not bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ self down to them , nor serve them , for I , Yah@@ we@@ h your God , am a Je@@ al@@ ous God , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation of those who h@@ ate me ,
but the seventh day is a Sab@@ b@@ ath to Yah@@ we@@ h your God . you shall not do any work in it , you , nor your son , nor your daughter , your male ser@@ vant , nor your female ser@@ vant , nor your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , nor your st@@ ran@@ ger who is within your gates ;

" speak also to the children of Israel , saying , ' Most certainly you shall keep my Sab@@ ba@@ ths : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h who sanc@@ ti@@ fies you .
you shall keep the Sab@@ b@@ ath therefore ; for it is hol@@ y to you . everyone who prof@@ an@@ es it shall su@@ rely be put to death ; for who@@ ever does any work there@@ in , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .

Aaron said to them , " T@@ ake off the golden r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them to me . "
all the people took off the golden r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars , and brought them to Aaron .
he received what they handed him , and fas@@ hi@@ oned it with an en@@ gra@@ ving tool , and made it a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f ; and they said , " These are your go@@ ds , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they rose up early on the next day , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and brought peace offer@@ ings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , " G@@ o , get down ; for your people , who you brought up out of the land of Egypt , have cor@@ rupted themselves !
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them . they have made themselves a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ ped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to it , and said , ' These are your go@@ ds , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
Mos@@ es beg@@ ged Yah@@ we@@ h his God , and said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , why does your wr@@ ath bur@@ n hot against your people , that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ?
why should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for ev@@ il , to kill them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ? ' turn from your fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against your people .
Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in his hand ; tab@@ lets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tab@@ lets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , en@@ gra@@ ved on the tables .
he said , " It is@@ n '@@ t the voice of those who sh@@ out for victory , neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome ; but the no@@ ise of those who sing that I hear . "
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger grew hot , and he threw the tab@@ lets out of his hands , and broke them ben@@ e@@ ath the mountain .
he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , ground it to pow@@ der , and sc@@ at@@ tered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said to me , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us ; for as for this Mos@@ es , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' W@@ ho@@ ever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this cal@@ f . "
then Mos@@ es stood in the gate of the camp , and said , " W@@ ho@@ ever is on Yah@@ we@@ h 's side , come to me ! " all the sons of L@@ evi gathered themselves together to him .
he said to them , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his s@@ word on his th@@ igh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neigh@@ bor . ' "
it happened on the next day , that Mos@@ es said to the people , " You have sin@@ ned a great sin . now I will go up to Yah@@ we@@ h . perhaps I shall make At@@ on@@ ement for your sin . "
yet now , if you will , for@@ give their sin@@ -@@ -@@ and if not , ple@@ ase blo@@ t me out of your book which you have written . "
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . be@@ hold , my an@@ gel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , " de@@ part , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . '
now Mos@@ es used to take the tent and to pit@@ ch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meet@@ ing . " it happened that everyone who sought Yah@@ we@@ h went out to the tent of Meet@@ ing , which was outside the camp .
it happened that when Mos@@ es went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Mos@@ es , until he had gone into the tent .
it happened , when Mos@@ es entered into the tent , that the pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud des@@ cen@@ ded , stood at the door of the tent , and spoke with Mos@@ es .
all the people saw the pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ ped , everyone at their tent door .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part out of the tent .
now therefore , if I have found fav@@ or in your sight , ple@@ ase show me now your ways , that I may know you , so that I may find fav@@ or in your sight : and consider that this nation is your people . "
he said , " I will make all my Go@@ od@@ ness pass before you , and will procla@@ im the name of Yah@@ we@@ h before you . I will be gr@@ ac@@ ious to whom I will be gr@@ ac@@ ious , and will show mer@@ cy on whom I will show mer@@ cy . "
it will happen , while my gl@@ ory passes by , that I will put you in a cle@@ ft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount S@@ ina@@ i , and present yo@@ ur@@ self there to me on the top of the mountain .
he ch@@ is@@ eled two tab@@ lets of stone like the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount S@@ ina@@ i , as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand two stone tab@@ lets .
keeping lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness for thousands , for@@ giving in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence and sin ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , and on the children 's children , on the third and on the fourth generation . "
observe that which I command you this day . be@@ hold , I drive out before you the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
be careful , lest you make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of you :
but you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash in pieces their pil@@ lars , and you shall cut down their Ash@@ er@@ im ;
" D@@ on '@@ t make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land , lest they play the pro@@ stitute after their go@@ ds , and sacrifice to their go@@ ds , and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice ;
and you take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to your sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters play the pro@@ stitute after their go@@ ds , and make your sons play the pro@@ stitute after their go@@ ds .
" you shall keep the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . seven days you shall eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , as I comman@@ ded you , at the time appointed in the month A@@ bi@@ b ; for in the month A@@ bi@@ b you came out from Egypt .

for I will drive out nations before you and en@@ large your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with le@@ av@@ ened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over be left to the morning .
" you shall bring the first of the first fru@@ its of your ground to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God . " you shall not bo@@ il a young go@@ at in its mother 's milk . "
it happened , when Mos@@ es came down from Mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Mos@@ es di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one by reason of his speaking with him .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come near him .
after@@ ward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the comman@@ d@@ ments that Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken with him on Mount S@@ ina@@ i .
but when Mos@@ es went in before Yah@@ we@@ h to speak with him , he took the ve@@ il off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was comman@@ ded .
the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es ' face , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the ve@@ il on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
Mos@@ es assemb@@ led all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and said to them , " These are the words which Yah@@ we@@ h has comman@@ ded , that you should do them .
'@@ Si@@ x days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a hol@@ y day for you , a Sab@@ b@@ ath of so@@ lem@@ n rest to Yah@@ we@@ h : who@@ ever does any work in it shall be put to death .
Mos@@ es spoke to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded , saying ,
and the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se with its po@@ les , the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , the swe@@ et incen@@ se , the screen for the door , at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ;
the fin@@ ely worked gar@@ ments , for minist@@ ering in the hol@@ y place , the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office . ' "
they came , everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Yah@@ we@@ h 's offering , for the work of the tent of Meet@@ ing , and for all of its service , and for the hol@@ y gar@@ ments .
everyone who offered an offering of silver and br@@ ass brought Yah@@ we@@ h 's offering ; and everyone , with whom was found ac@@ ac@@ ia wood for any work of the service , brought it .
all the women who were wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted sp@@ un with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , the blue , the pur@@ ple , the scar@@ let , and the fine lin@@ en .
the rul@@ ers brought the ony@@ x stones , and the stones to be set , for the ep@@ ho@@ d and for the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te ;
the children of Israel brought a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Yah@@ we@@ h ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded to be made by Mos@@ es .
he has put in his heart that he may te@@ ach , both he , and O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan .
Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ el and O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted man , in whose heart Yah@@ we@@ h had put wis@@ dom , even everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come to the work to do it :
they spoke to Mos@@ es , saying , " The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded to make . "
all the wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted men among those who did the work made the tab@@ ern@@ acle with ten cur@@ tains ; of fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en , blue , pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , the work of the s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man , they made them .
the length of each cur@@ tain was twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th of each cur@@ tain four cu@@ bi@@ ts . all the cur@@ tains had one measure .
he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of the one cur@@ tain from the edge in the cou@@ pling . likewise he made in the edge of the cur@@ tain that was out@@ most in the second cou@@ pling .

there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its one side , and three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its other side :
three c@@ ups made like al@@ mond b@@ los@@ s@@ oms in one branch , a bu@@ d and a f@@ lower , and three c@@ ups made like al@@ mond b@@ los@@ s@@ oms in the other branch , a bu@@ d and a f@@ lower : so for the six branches going out of the lam@@ p@@ stand .

he made the bas@@ in of br@@ ass , and its base of br@@ ass , out of the mir@@ r@@ ors of the minist@@ ering women who minist@@ ered at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
their pil@@ lars were twenty , and their so@@ c@@ kets twenty , of br@@ ass ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets were of silver .
for the west side were han@@ g@@ ings of fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , their pil@@ lars ten , and their so@@ c@@ kets ten ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars , and their fil@@ lets , of silver .

all the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the gold of the offering , was twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine tal@@ ents , and seven hundred thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the silver of those who were num@@ ber@@ ed of the Con@@ gre@@ gation was one hundred tal@@ ents , and one thousand seven hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :

they beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , in the pur@@ ple , in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , the work of the s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man .
they made sho@@ ul@@ der stra@@ ps for it , joined together . at the two ends it was joined together .
the s@@ kil@@ l@@ fully w@@ ov@@ en band that was on it , with which to fas@@ ten it on , was of the same piece , like its work ; of gold , of blue , pur@@ ple , scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en ; as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
they worked the ony@@ x stones , en@@ closed in sett@@ ings of gold , en@@ gra@@ ved with the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , according to the names of the children of Israel .
he put them on the sho@@ ul@@ der stra@@ ps of the ep@@ ho@@ d , to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
he made the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , the work of a s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man , like the work of the ep@@ ho@@ d ; of gold , of blue , pur@@ ple , scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en .

they bound the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te by its r@@ ings to the r@@ ings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a la@@ ce of blue , that it might be on the s@@ kil@@ l@@ fully w@@ ov@@ en band of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te might not come loose from the ep@@ ho@@ d , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
the opening of the ro@@ be in its mid@@ st was like the opening of a co@@ at of mail , with a binding around its opening , that it should not be torn .
they made the pla@@ te of the hol@@ y cro@@ wn of p@@ ure gold , and wrote on it a writing , like the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net : " Holy TO Y@@ A@@ H@@ W@@ E@@ H . "
thus all the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of Meet@@ ing was finished . the children of Israel did according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es ; so they did .
Mos@@ es saw all the work , and be@@ hold , they had done it as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded , even so had they done it : and Mos@@ es b@@ les@@ sed them .

it happened in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was raised up .
Mos@@ es raised up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and laid its so@@ c@@ kets , and set up its boards , and put in its bars , and raised up its pil@@ lars .
he took and put the testimony into the Ar@@ k , and set the po@@ les on the Ar@@ k , and put the mer@@ cy seat above on the Ar@@ k .

this was the work@@ manship of the lam@@ p@@ stand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pat@@ tern which Yah@@ we@@ h had shown Mos@@ es , so he made the lam@@ p@@ stand .

Mos@@ es , and Aaron , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel did so to the L@@ evi@@ tes . according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so the children of Israel did to them .
the L@@ evi@@ tes pur@@ ified themselves from sin , and they was@@ hed their clo@@ th@@ es ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and Aaron made At@@ on@@ ement for them to cleans@@ e them .
after that , the L@@ evi@@ tes went in to do their service in the tent of Meet@@ ing before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so they did to them .

Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of this month , at evening , you shall keep it in its appointed se@@ as@@ on@@ -@@ -@@ according to all its stat@@ utes , and according to all its ord@@ inan@@ ces , you shall keep it . "
they kept the P@@ ass@@ over in the first month , on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , at evening , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i . according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the P@@ ass@@ over on that day , and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day .
those men said to him , " We are un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Yah@@ we@@ h in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "
in the second month , on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread and bitter her@@ bs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the P@@ ass@@ over they shall keep it .
but the man who is clean , and is not on a journey , and fails to keep the P@@ ass@@ over , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people . because he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t offer the offering of Yah@@ we@@ h in its appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was raised up , the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even the tent of the testimony : and at evening it was over the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until morning .
wh@@ en@@ ever the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel trav@@ eled ; and in the place where the cl@@ oud remained , there the children of Israel en@@ camp@@ ed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , the children of Israel trav@@ eled , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h they en@@ camp@@ ed . as long as the cl@@ oud remained on the tab@@ ern@@ acle they remained en@@ camp@@ ed .
when the cl@@ oud stayed on the tab@@ ern@@ acle many days , then the children of Israel kept Yah@@ we@@ h 's command , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t travel .
" make two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
but when the assembly is to be gathered together , you shall blow , but you shall not sound an alarm .

it happened in the second year , in the second month , on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
the children of Israel went forward according to their jour@@ neys out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i ; and the cl@@ oud stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went forward according to their armies . N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b was over his army .
the tab@@ ern@@ acle was taken down ; and the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on and the sons of Mer@@ ari , who b@@ ore the tab@@ ern@@ acle , went forward .
the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies . E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud was over his army .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the re@@ ar guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i was over his army .
P@@ ag@@ i@@ el the son of O@@ ch@@ ran was over the army of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yah@@ we@@ h does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yah@@ we@@ h three days ' journey . the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the Ar@@ k went forward , that Mos@@ es said , " R@@ ise up , Yah@@ we@@ h , and let your enem@@ ies be sc@@ at@@ tered ! let those who h@@ ate you flee before you ! "
the people were compla@@ ining in the e@@ ars of Yah@@ we@@ h . when Yah@@ we@@ h heard it , his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and Yah@@ we@@ h 's fire bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med some of the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the camp .
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the gar@@ lic ;
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mil@@ ls , or beat it in mor@@ tar@@ s , and bo@@ iled it in po@@ ts , and made cak@@ es of it . its tas@@ te was like the tas@@ te of fresh oil .
Mos@@ es heard the people we@@ eping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led greatly ; and Mos@@ es was disp@@ le@@ ased .
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they we@@ ep to me , saying , ' Gi@@ ve us meat , that we may eat . '
if you treat me this way , ple@@ ase kill me right now , if I have found fav@@ or in your sight ; and don '@@ t let me see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " G@@ ather to me sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of Israel , whom you know to be the el@@ ders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the tent of Meet@@ ing , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spiri@@ t which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yo@@ ur@@ self alone .
but a whole month , until it come out at your nos@@ tr@@ ils , and it is lo@@ ath@@ some to you ; because that you have rejected Yah@@ we@@ h who is among you , and have we@@ pt before him , saying , " Wh@@ y did we come out of Egypt ? " ' "
shall f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds be sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Mos@@ es went out , and told the people the words of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he gathered sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the people , and set them around the tent .
Yah@@ we@@ h came down in the cl@@ oud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spiri@@ t that was on him , and put it on the sev@@ enty el@@ ders : and it happened that when the Spiri@@ t rested on them , they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , but they did so no more .
but two men remained in the camp . the name of one was El@@ dad , and the name of the other Med@@ ad : and the Spiri@@ t rested on them ; and they were of those who were written , but had not gone out to the tent ; and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the camp .
a wind from Yah@@ we@@ h went out and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cu@@ bi@@ ts above the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the qu@@ ails . he who gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , before it was che@@ wed , the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and Yah@@ we@@ h struck the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
Mi@@ ri@@ am and Aaron spoke against Mos@@ es because of the C@@ ush@@ ite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a C@@ ush@@ ite woman .
now the man Mos@@ es was very hum@@ ble , above all the men who were on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h came down in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am ; and they both came forward .
he said , " He@@ ar now my words . if there is a pro@@ phe@@ t among you , I Yah@@ we@@ h will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
with him I will speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even pla@@ in@@ ly , and not in rid@@ d@@ les ; and he shall see Yah@@ we@@ h 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant , against Mos@@ es ? "
Aaron said to Mos@@ es , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase don '@@ t count this sin against us , in which we have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , and in which we have sin@@ ned .
let her not , I pra@@ y , be as one dead , of whom the f@@ les@@ h is half consu@@ med when he comes out of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b . "
Mos@@ es sent them from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
Mos@@ es sent them to sp@@ y out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said to them , " G@@ o up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they d@@ well in , whether in camps , or in stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ;
they went up by the South , and came to He@@ br@@ on ; and Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were there . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
they came to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from there a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ ore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates and fig@@ s .
that place was called the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , because of the cl@@ us@@ ter which the children of Israel cut down from there .
they went and came to Mos@@ es , and to Aaron , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an , to K@@ ade@@ sh ; and brought back word to them , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and showed them the fruit of the land .

all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said to them , " Wo@@ uld that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !

only don '@@ t rebel against Yah@@ we@@ h , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defen@@ se is removed from over them , and Yah@@ we@@ h is with us . D@@ on '@@ t fear them . "
but all the Con@@ gre@@ gation threatened to stone them with stones . the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the tent of Meet@@ ing to all the children of Israel .

I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken , su@@ rely this will I do to all this ev@@ il Con@@ gre@@ gation , who are gathered together against me : in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they shall be consu@@ med , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Mos@@ es sent to sp@@ y out the land , who returned , and made all the Con@@ gre@@ gation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up an ev@@ il report against the land ,
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , remained alive of those men who went to sp@@ y out the land .
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " be@@ hold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h has promised : for we have sin@@ ned . "
for there the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite are before you , and you shall fall by the s@@ word : because you are turned back from following Yah@@ we@@ h , therefore Yah@@ we@@ h will not be with you . "

S@@ ih@@ on would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but S@@ ih@@ on gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and came to Ja@@ haz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel struck him with the edge of the s@@ word , and poss@@ essed his land from the Ar@@ non to the J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , even to the children of Am@@ mon ; for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
Israel took all these cities : and Israel lived in all the cities of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and in all its towns .

Mo@@ a@@ b was very afraid of the people , because they were many : and Mo@@ a@@ b was dist@@ ressed because of the children of Israel .
the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and spoke to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : now , come cur@@ se me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
the pr@@ inces of Mo@@ a@@ b rose up , and they went to Bal@@ ak , and said , " Bal@@ a@@ am refuses to come with us . "
God came to Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went ; and the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h placed himself in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding on his don@@ key , and his two servants were with him .
the don@@ key saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his s@@ word drawn in his hand ; and the don@@ key turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am struck the don@@ key , to turn her into the way .
then the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h stood in a narrow path between the v@@ ine@@ yards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the don@@ key saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h , and she th@@ rust her@@ self to the wall , and cr@@ us@@ hed Bal@@ a@@ am 's fo@@ ot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
the don@@ key saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h , and she lay down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led , and he struck the don@@ key with his staff .
then Yah@@ we@@ h opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his s@@ word drawn in his hand ; and he bo@@ wed his head , and fell on his face .
and the don@@ key saw me , and turned aside before me these three times . unless she had turned aside from me , su@@ rely now I would have killed you , and sav@@ ed her alive . "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " G@@ o with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the pr@@ inces of Bal@@ ak .
when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is on the border of the Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most part of the border .
Bal@@ ak said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly send to you to call you ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to hon@@ or ? "
Bal@@ a@@ am said to Bal@@ ak , " be@@ hold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my m@@ outh , that shall I speak . "
it happened in the morning , that Bal@@ ak took Bal@@ a@@ am , and brought him up into the high places of Ba@@ al ; and he saw from there the ut@@ most part of the people .

who can count the d@@ ust of Jac@@ o@@ b , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righ@@ te@@ ous ! let my last end be like his ! "
God is not a man , that he should lie , nor the son of man , that he should rep@@ ent . has he said , and will he not do it ? or has he spoken , and will he not make it good ?
be@@ hold , the people rises up as a li@@ on@@ ess , As a lion he lif@@ ts himself up . he shall not lie down until he eat of the pre@@ y , and drin@@ ks the blood of the sla@@ in . "
when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased Yah@@ we@@ h to b@@ less Israel , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go , as at the other times , to meet with en@@ chan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
Bal@@ a@@ am lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel d@@ wel@@ ling according to their tri@@ bes ; and the Spiri@@ t of God came on him .
water shall flow from his bu@@ c@@ kets . his se@@ ed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than A@@ ga@@ g . his k@@ ing@@ dom shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
God brings him out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild o@@ x . he shall eat up the nations his ad@@ vers@@ aries , shall break their b@@ ones in pieces , and Pi@@ erce them with his ar@@ ro@@ ws .
Bal@@ ak 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he struck his hands together ; and Bal@@ ak said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " I called you to cur@@ se my enem@@ ies , and , be@@ hold , you have altogether b@@ les@@ sed them these three times .
now , be@@ hold , I go to my people : come , I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days . "
he says , who he@@ ars the words of God , knows the knowledge of the Most High , and who sees the vision of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , Fal@@ ling down , and having his eyes open :
I see him , but not now . I see him , but not near . a star will come out of Jac@@ o@@ b . a scep@@ ter will rise out of Israel , and shall strike through the cor@@ ners of Mo@@ a@@ b , and break down all the sons of Sh@@ eth .
he looked at A@@ mal@@ ek , and took up his par@@ able , and said , " A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
he looked at the Ken@@ ite , and took up his par@@ able , and said , " Y@@ our d@@ wel@@ ling place is strong . your n@@ est is set in the rock .

Mos@@ es spoke to the heads of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yah@@ we@@ h has comman@@ ded .

these are the stat@@ utes , which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , saying ,
Mos@@ es sent them , one thousand of every tri@@ be , to the war , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the tr@@ ump@@ ets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Mi@@ dian with the rest of their sla@@ in : Evi , and Rek@@ em , and Z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , the five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they killed with the s@@ word .
the children of Israel took cap@@ tive the women of Mi@@ dian and their little ones ; and all their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods , they took for a pre@@ y .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their en@@ camp@@ ments , they bur@@ n@@ t with fire .
they brought the cap@@ tives , and the pre@@ y , and the sp@@ oil , to Mos@@ es , and to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and to the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , which are by the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Mos@@ es was angry with the officers of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
be@@ hold , these caused the children of Israel , through the coun@@ sel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ res@@ pass against Yah@@ we@@ h in the matter of Pe@@ or , and so the pla@@ gue was among the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
" En@@ camp outside of the camp seven days : who@@ ever has killed any person , and who@@ ever has touched any sla@@ in , pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your cap@@ tives .
as to every gar@@ ment , and all that is made of s@@ kin , and all work of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir , and all things made of wood , you shall pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
you shall was@@ h your clo@@ th@@ es on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and after@@ ward you shall come into the camp . "
" take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
lev@@ y a tri@@ bute to Yah@@ we@@ h of the men of war who went out to battle : one sou@@ l of five hundred ; of the persons , of the c@@ attle , of the don@@ ke@@ ys , and of the f@@ loc@@ ks .
now the pre@@ y , over and above the bo@@ o@@ ty which the men of war took , was six hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand she@@ ep ,
and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand five hundred she@@ ep :
even of the children of Israel 's half , Mos@@ es took one drawn out of every fif@@ ty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the L@@ evi@@ tes , who performed the duty of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h ; as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near to Mos@@ es ;
and they said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ our servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yah@@ we@@ h , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meet@@ ing , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yah@@ we@@ h .
now the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad had a very great multi@@ tude of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and when they saw the land of Jaz@@ er , and the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that be@@ hold , the place was a place for li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck ;
they said , " If we have found fav@@ or in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don '@@ t bring us over the Jordan . "
Mos@@ es said to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , " shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
for when they went up to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yah@@ we@@ h had given them .
Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander back and forth in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , who had done ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , was consu@@ med .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the for@@ ti@@ fied cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inher@@ it@@ ance .
for we will not inher@@ it with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inher@@ it@@ ance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eas@@ tw@@ ard . "
and the land is sub@@ du@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h ; then after@@ ward you shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less towards Yah@@ we@@ h , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Mos@@ es comman@@ ded concerning them to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered , saying , " As Yah@@ we@@ h has said to your servants , so will we do .
Mos@@ es gave to them , even to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , the k@@ ing@@ dom of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .

these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
Mos@@ es wrote their go@@ ings out according to their jour@@ neys by the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h : and these are their jour@@ neys according to their go@@ ings out .
they trav@@ eled from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the next day after the P@@ ass@@ over the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,

Aaron the pri@@ est went up into Mount H@@ or at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , and died there , in the for@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the king of Ara@@ d , who lived in the South in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ,

the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the family of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel :

they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph ; and their inher@@ it@@ ance remained in the tri@@ be of the family of their father .
it happened in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment to them ;
be@@ hold , I have set the land before you : go in and poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , to give to them and to their se@@ ed after them . "
Yah@@ we@@ h your God has multi@@ p@@ lied you , and be@@ hold , you are this day as the stars of the sky for multi@@ tude .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and b@@ less you , as he has promised you !
you answ@@ ered me , and said , " The thing which you have spoken is good to do . "
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us .
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h your God has set the land before you : go up , take possession , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has spoken to you ; don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and sp@@ ied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
and you mur@@ mu@@ red in your ten@@ ts , and said , " Bec@@ ause Yah@@ we@@ h ha@@ ted us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us .
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cl@@ oud by day .
Jos@@ hua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inher@@ it it .
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or ev@@ il , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
so I spoke to you , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ; but you rebel@@ led against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , and were pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous , and went up into the hill country .
the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and ch@@ ased you , as be@@ es do , and beat you down in Se@@ ir , even to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
then we turned , and took our journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to me ; and we en@@ circ@@ led Mount Se@@ ir many days .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore ;
D@@ on '@@ t conten@@ d with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the fo@@ ot to tre@@ ad on ; because I have given Mount Se@@ ir to E@@ sa@@ u for a possession .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
so we passed by from our brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir , from the way of the Ara@@ bah from E@@ la@@ th and from E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber . we turned and passed by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Mo@@ a@@ b .
moreover the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against them , to destroy them from the mid@@ st of the camp , until they were consu@@ med .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consu@@ med and dead from among the people ,
and the Av@@ vi@@ m , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ im , who came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non : be@@ hold , I have given into your hand S@@ ih@@ on the Am@@ or@@ ite , king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and his land ; begin to poss@@ ess it , and conten@@ d with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of you . "
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
only the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves , with the sp@@ oil of the cities which we had taken .
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the val@@ ley , even to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not a city too high for us ; Yah@@ we@@ h our God delivered up all before us :
only to the land of the children of Am@@ mon you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come near ; all the side of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , and the cities of the hill country , and wher@@ ever Yah@@ we@@ h our God for@@ b@@ ade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " D@@ on '@@ t fear him ; for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into your hand ; and you shall do to him as you did to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who lived at H@@ es@@ h@@ bon . "
we took all his cities at that time ; there was not a city which we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take from them ; six@@ ty cities , all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g in B@@ ash@@ an .
but all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the sp@@ oil of the cities , we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes who were beyond the Jordan , from the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon .
( for only O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an remained of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im ; be@@ hold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is@@ n '@@ t it in R@@ ab@@ bah of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cu@@ bi@@ ts was its length , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts its b@@ read@@ th , after the cu@@ bit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and half the hill country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and its cities , gave I to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes :
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , even all B@@ ash@@ an . ( the same is called the land of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even to the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , the middle of the val@@ ley , and its border , even to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
the Ara@@ bah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth even to the sea of the Ara@@ bah , the Sal@@ t Sea , under the s@@ lop@@ es of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard .
I comman@@ ded you at that time , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you this land to poss@@ ess it : you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel , all the men of val@@ or .
I comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua at that time , saying , " Y@@ our eyes have seen all that Yah@@ we@@ h your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yah@@ we@@ h do to all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms where you go over .
" Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , you have begun to show your ser@@ vant your gre@@ at@@ ness , and your strong hand : for what go@@ d is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to your works , and according to your m@@ igh@@ ty acts ?
go up to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and lift up your eyes w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you dimin@@ ish from it , that you may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God which I command you .
be@@ hold , I have ta@@ ught you stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces , even as Yah@@ we@@ h my God comman@@ ded me , that you should do so in the mid@@ st of the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
only take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self , and keep your sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they de@@ part from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you out of the mid@@ st of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which he comman@@ ded you to perform , even the ten comman@@ d@@ ments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded me at that time to te@@ ach you stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces , that you might do them in the land where you go over to poss@@ ess it .
take therefore good heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you in Ho@@ re@@ b out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
but Yah@@ we@@ h has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron fur@@ n@@ ace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inher@@ it@@ ance , as at this day .
furthermore Yah@@ we@@ h was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and s@@ wor@@ e that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest you forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which he made with you , and make you an en@@ gra@@ ved image in the form of anything which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has for@@ bid@@ den you .
Yah@@ we@@ h will sc@@ at@@ ter you among the peoples , and you shall be left few in number among the nations , where Yah@@ we@@ h shall lead you away .
but from there you shall seek Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
when you are in op@@ pression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is a mer@@ ci@@ ful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of your fa@@ thers which he s@@ wor@@ e to them .
out of heav@@ en he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruc@@ t you : and on ear@@ th he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
because he lov@@ ed your fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought you out with his presence , with his great power , out of Egypt ;
that the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er might flee there , who kills his neigh@@ bor un@@ awar@@ es , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t h@@ ate him in time past ; and that fle@@ eing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sun@@ rise ;
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t make this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with our fa@@ thers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yah@@ we@@ h and you at that time , to show you the word of Yah@@ we@@ h : for you were afraid because of the fire , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an en@@ gra@@ ved image for yo@@ ur@@ self , any lik@@ eness of what is in heav@@ en above , or what is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
you shall not bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ self to them , nor serve them ; for I , Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , am a Je@@ al@@ ous God , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who h@@ ate me ;
you shall remember that you were a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God brought you out of there by a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by an out@@ stret@@ ched arm : therefore Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you to keep the Sab@@ b@@ ath day .
" hon@@ or your father and your mother , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you ; that your days may be long , and that it may go well with you , in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
" neither shall you c@@ ov@@ et your neigh@@ bor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neigh@@ bor 's house , his field , or his male ser@@ vant , or his female ser@@ vant , his o@@ x , or his don@@ key , or anything that is your neigh@@ bor 's . "
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and you said , " be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h our God has shown us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consum@@ e us : if we hear the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all f@@ les@@ h , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the mid@@ st of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
go near , and hear all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall say : and tell us all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
Yah@@ we@@ h heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
O@@ h that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children fore@@ ver !
you shall observe to do therefore as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land which you shall poss@@ ess .
now this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded to te@@ ach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to poss@@ ess it ;
that you might fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
hear therefore , Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with you , and that you may increase m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has promised to you , in a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
and you shall love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your might .
and you shall te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the mid@@ st of you is a Je@@ al@@ ous God ; lest the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h your God be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the ear@@ th .
you shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and his testimon@@ ies , and his stat@@ utes , which he has comman@@ ded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and poss@@ ess the good land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers ,
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimon@@ ies , the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Yah@@ we@@ h our God has comman@@ ded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's bon@@ d@@ servants in Egypt : and Yah@@ we@@ h brought us out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ;
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers .
and when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall deliver them up before you , and you shall strike them ; then you shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them : you shall make no C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , nor show mer@@ cy to them ;
neither shall you make marri@@ ages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other go@@ ds : so the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h would be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash their pil@@ lars in pieces , and cut down their Ash@@ er@@ im , and bur@@ n their en@@ gra@@ ved images with fire .
for you are a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : Yah@@ we@@ h your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fe@@ west of all peoples :
but because Yah@@ we@@ h lov@@ es you , and because he would keep the oath which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , has Yah@@ we@@ h brought you out with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge , from the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt .
know therefore that Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God , the fa@@ ith@@ ful God , who keeps C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness with them who love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments to a thousand generations ,
and rep@@ ays those who h@@ ate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be S@@ lack to him who ha@@ tes him , he will repay him to his face .
it shall happen , because you listen to these ord@@ inan@@ ces , and keep and do them , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God will keep with you the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers :
Yah@@ we@@ h will take away from you all si@@ ck@@ ness ; and none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who h@@ ate you .
you shall consum@@ e all the peoples whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not p@@ ity them : neither shall you serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are to you .
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yah@@ we@@ h your God did to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yah@@ we@@ h your God will send the hor@@ net among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , per@@ ish from before you .
you shall not be scar@@ ed of them ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is in the mid@@ st of you , a great and aw@@ es@@ ome God .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consum@@ e them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to per@@ ish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multi@@ ply , and go in and poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers .
a land in which you shall eat bread without scar@@ cen@@ ess , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hil@@ ls you may di@@ g cop@@ per .
be@@ w@@ are lest you forget Yah@@ we@@ h your God , in not keeping his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and his stat@@ utes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have e@@ aten and are full , and have built good@@ ly houses , and lived there@@ in ;
and when your her@@ ds and your f@@ loc@@ ks multi@@ ply , and your silver and your gold is multi@@ p@@ lied , and all that you have is multi@@ p@@ lied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
who led you through the great and ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , with fi@@ ery Ser@@ pen@@ ts and S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and thir@@ st@@ y ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of F@@ lin@@ t ;
who f@@ ed you in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with man@@ na , which your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; that he might hum@@ ble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yah@@ we@@ h your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , as at this day .
as the nations that Yah@@ we@@ h makes to per@@ ish before you , so you shall per@@ ish ; because you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
a people great and t@@ all , the sons of the An@@ ak@@ im , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Wh@@ o can stand before the sons of An@@ ak ? "
remember , don '@@ t forget , how you provoked Yah@@ we@@ h your God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against Yah@@ we@@ h .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which Yah@@ we@@ h made with you , then I stayed on the mountain for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; I neither ate bread nor d@@ rank water .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the fin@@ ger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke with you on the mountain out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly .
it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that Yah@@ we@@ h gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have cor@@ rupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I comman@@ ded them ; they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten image . "
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blo@@ t out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant were in my two hands .
I looked , and be@@ hold , you had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; you had made yo@@ ur@@ selves a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded you .
for I was afraid of the an@@ ger and hot disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , with which Yah@@ we@@ h was angry against you to destroy you . but Yah@@ we@@ h list@@ ened to me that time also .
when Yah@@ we@@ h sent you from K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea , saying , " G@@ o up and poss@@ ess the land which I have given you " ; then you rebel@@ led against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe him , nor listen to his voice .
I pray@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t destroy your people and your inher@@ it@@ ance , that you have re@@ deemed through your gre@@ at@@ ness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand .
remember your servants , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b ; don '@@ t look to the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of this people , nor to their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor to their sin ,
lest the land you brought us out from say , ' Bec@@ ause Yah@@ we@@ h was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them , and because he ha@@ ted them , he has brought them out to kill them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . '
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ar@@ k . "
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you on the mountain out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them to me .
( the children of Israel trav@@ eled from Be@@ ero@@ th B@@ ene Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ er@@ ah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his place .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God of go@@ ds , and Lord of lor@@ ds , the great God , the m@@ igh@@ ty , and the aw@@ es@@ ome , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect persons , nor takes reward .
he is your praise , and he is your God , who has done for you these great and aw@@ es@@ ome things , which your eyes have seen .
know this day : for I don '@@ t speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , his gre@@ at@@ ness , his m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and his out@@ stret@@ ched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how Yah@@ we@@ h has destroyed them to this day ;
therefore you shall keep all the comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and poss@@ ess the land , where you go over to poss@@ ess it ;
and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give to them and to their se@@ ed , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
for the land , where you go in to poss@@ ess it , is@@ n '@@ t as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you so@@ wed your se@@ ed , and wat@@ ered it with your fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs ;
but the land , where you go over to poss@@ ess it , is a land of hil@@ ls and val@@ ley@@ s which drin@@ ks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God car@@ es for : the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your gra@@ in , and your new wine , and your oil .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest your heart be dec@@ e@@ ived , and you turn aside , and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
and the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you per@@ ish quickly from off the good land which Yah@@ we@@ h gives you .
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l ; and you shall bin@@ d them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall te@@ ach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for if you shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep all this comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you , to do it , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place where@@ on the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even to the hin@@ der sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you on all the land that you shall tre@@ ad on , as he has spoken to you .
the b@@ les@@ sing , if you shall listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day ;
and the cur@@ se , if you shall not listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which you have not known .
it shall happen , when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall bring you into the land where you go to poss@@ ess it , that you shall set the b@@ les@@ sing on Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se on Mount E@@ bal .
A@@ ren '@@ t they beyond the Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun , in the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who d@@ well in the Ara@@ bah , over against G@@ ilg@@ al , bes@@ ide the o@@ aks of Mo@@ re@@ h ?
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and you shall poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in .
these are the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces which you shall observe to do in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has given you to poss@@ ess it , all the days that you live on the ear@@ th .
you shall su@@ rely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , on the high mountains , and on the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash in pieces their pil@@ lars , and bur@@ n their Ash@@ er@@ im with fire ; and you shall cut down the en@@ gra@@ ved images of their go@@ ds ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose out of all your tri@@ bes , to put his name there , even to his habi@@ tation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and your ti@@ th@@ es , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but when you go over the Jordan , and d@@ well in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God causes you to inher@@ it , and he gives you rest from all your enem@@ ies around you , so that you d@@ well in safety ;
then it shall happen that to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h .
but in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose in one of your tri@@ bes , there you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
you may not eat within your gates the ti@@ the of your gra@@ in , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vo@@ w , nor your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self that you don '@@ t for@@ sake the Lev@@ ite as long as you live in your land .
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall en@@ large your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your sou@@ l desi@@ res to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
if the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your her@@ d and of your flock , which Yah@@ we@@ h has given you , as I have comman@@ ded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
even as the gaz@@ elle and as the har@@ t is e@@ aten , so you shall eat of it : the un@@ clean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only be sure that you don '@@ t eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the f@@ les@@ h .
you shall not eat it ; that it may go well with you , and with your children after you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h .
only your hol@@ y things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose :
and you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and the blood of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and you shall eat the f@@ les@@ h .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you fore@@ ver , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and you dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and d@@ well in their land ;
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self that you not be en@@ s@@ nar@@ ed to follow them , after that they are destroyed from before you ; and that you not inqu@@ ire after their go@@ ds , saying , " Ho@@ w do these nations serve their go@@ ds ? I will do likewise . "
you shall not do so to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , which he ha@@ tes , have they done to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters do they bur@@ n in the fire to their go@@ ds .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other go@@ ds " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall not listen to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or to that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God proves you , to know whether you love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye p@@ ity him , neither shall you spar@@ e , neither shall you conce@@ al him :
but you shall su@@ rely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then you shall inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in the mid@@ st of you ,
you shall su@@ rely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in and its li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , with the edge of the s@@ word .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yah@@ we@@ h may turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger , and show you mer@@ cy , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and multi@@ ply you , as he has sworn to your fa@@ thers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
for you are a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the ear@@ th .
the har@@ t , and the gaz@@ elle , and the ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck , and the wild go@@ at , and the i@@ be@@ x , and the an@@ tel@@ ope , and the ch@@ am@@ o@@ is .
every animal that parts the ho@@ of , and has the ho@@ of cl@@ ov@@ en in two and che@@ ws the cu@@ d , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pi@@ g , because it has a split ho@@ of but do@@ es@@ n '@@ t ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , is un@@ clean to you : of their f@@ les@@ h you shall not eat , and their car@@ c@@ ass@@ es you shall not touch .
and the red k@@ ite , and the fal@@ c@@ on , and the k@@ ite after its kind ,
then you shall turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the ti@@ the of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
this is the way of the release : every credi@@ tor shall release that which he has l@@ ent to his neigh@@ bor ; he shall not exact it of his neigh@@ bor and his brother ; because Yah@@ we@@ h 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreig@@ ner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you , as he promised you : and you shall lend to many nations , but you shall not bor@@ row ; and you shall rule over many nations , but they shall not rule over you .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not har@@ den your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall su@@ rely open your hand to him , and shall su@@ rely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
you shall su@@ rely give him , and your heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
for the poor will never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall su@@ rely open your hand to your brother , to your ne@@ edy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w man , or a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your th@@ res@@ hing floor , and out of your win@@ e@@ press ; as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God re@@ deemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
it shall be , if he tells you , " I will not go out from you " ; because he lov@@ es you and your house , because he is well with you ;
all the fir@@ st@@ born mal@@ es that are born of your her@@ d and of your flock you shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : you shall do no work with the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d , nor s@@ hear the fir@@ st@@ born of your flock .
observe the month of A@@ bi@@ b , and keep the P@@ ass@@ over to Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; for in the month of A@@ bi@@ b Yah@@ we@@ h your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
no ye@@ ast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days ; neither shall any of the f@@ les@@ h , which you sacrifice the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well in , there you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
you shall ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your ten@@ ts .
you shall count for yo@@ ur@@ selves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the standing gra@@ in you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yah@@ we@@ h your God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yah@@ we@@ h your God b@@ les@@ ses you :
you shall keep the feast of ten@@ ts seven days , after that you have gathered in from your th@@ res@@ hing floor and from your win@@ e@@ press :
and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male ser@@ vant , and your female ser@@ vant , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , who are within your gates .
you shall keep a feast to Yah@@ we@@ h your God seven days in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; because Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you in all your increase , and in all the work of your hands , and you shall be altogether jo@@ y@@ ful .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , according to your tri@@ bes ; and they shall judge the people with righ@@ te@@ ous judgment .
you shall not w@@ rest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does b@@ lin@@ d the eyes of the wise , and per@@ ver@@ t the words of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
you shall not plant for yo@@ ur@@ selves an Ash@@ er@@ ah of any kind of tree bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which you shall make for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
you shall not sacrifice to Yah@@ we@@ h your God an o@@ x , or a she@@ ep , in which is a ble@@ mis@@ h , or anything ev@@ il ; for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
if there is found in the mid@@ st of you , within any of your gates which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and has gone and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ ped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not comman@@ ded ;
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inqu@@ ire dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and be@@ hold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in Israel ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this ev@@ il thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the m@@ outh of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
if there ar@@ ises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose ;
and you shall come to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inqu@@ ire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall te@@ ach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall te@@ ach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , in not list@@ ening to the pri@@ est who stands to minister there before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and shall poss@@ ess it , and shall d@@ well there@@ in , and shall say , " I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are around me " ;
you shall su@@ rely set him king over yo@@ ur@@ selves , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreig@@ ner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multi@@ ply hor@@ ses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multi@@ ply hor@@ ses ; because Yah@@ we@@ h has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
it shall be , when he s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book , out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read there@@ in all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h his God , to keep all the words of this law and these stat@@ utes , to do them ;
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
this shall be the pri@@ ests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep , that they shall give to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
the first fru@@ its of your gra@@ in , of your new wine , and of your oil , and the first of the F@@ le@@ ece of your she@@ ep , you shall give him .
if a Lev@@ ite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreig@@ ner , and comes with all the desire of his sou@@ l to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as all his brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes do , who stand there before Yah@@ we@@ h .
when you have come into the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses div@@ ination , one who practices sor@@ cer@@ y , or an en@@ chan@@ ter , or a sor@@ cer@@ er ,
you shall be perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
for these nations , that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess , listen to those who practice sor@@ cer@@ y , and to di@@ vin@@ ers ; but as for you , Yah@@ we@@ h your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will raise up to you a pro@@ phe@@ t from the mid@@ st of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
this is according to all that you desi@@ red of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
I will raise them up a pro@@ phe@@ t from among their brothers , like you ; and I will put my words in his m@@ outh , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
it shall happen , that who@@ ever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , who shall speak a word pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , that same pro@@ phe@@ t shall die . "
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and you succeed them , and d@@ well in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man ha@@ tes his neigh@@ bor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mort@@ ally so that he dies , and he fle@@ es into one of these cities ;
your eye shall not p@@ ity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
you shall not remove your neigh@@ bor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inher@@ it@@ ance which you shall inher@@ it , in the land that Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to poss@@ ess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sin@@ s : at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or at the m@@ outh of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yah@@ we@@ h , before the pri@@ ests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make dil@@ ig@@ ent In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition : and , be@@ hold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified fal@@ sely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enem@@ ies , and see hor@@ ses , char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the pri@@ est shall approach and speak to the people ,
and shall tell them , " He@@ ar , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enem@@ ies : D@@ on '@@ t let your heart fa@@ int ; don '@@ t be afraid , nor tre@@ m@@ ble , neither be scar@@ ed of them ;
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
what man is there who has plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fear@@ ful and fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart mel@@ t as his heart . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint cap@@ tains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found there@@ in shall become tri@@ but@@ ary to you , and shall serve you .
and when Yah@@ we@@ h your God deli@@ vers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the s@@ word :
but the women , and the little ones , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that is in the city , even all its sp@@ oil , you shall take for a pre@@ y to yo@@ ur@@ self ; and you shall eat the sp@@ oil of your enem@@ ies , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but you shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them : the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite ; as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you ;
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bul@@ war@@ ks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found sla@@ in in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to poss@@ ess it , lying in the field , and it is@@ n '@@ t known who has struck him ;
then your el@@ ders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is sla@@ in :
and it shall be , that the city which is near@@ est to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take a he@@ if@@ er of the her@@ d , which has@@ n '@@ t been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
and the el@@ ders of that city shall bring down the he@@ if@@ er to a val@@ ley with running water , which is neither p@@ low@@ ed nor so@@ wn , and shall break the he@@ if@@ er 's nec@@ k there in the val@@ ley .
the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi shall come near ; for them Yah@@ we@@ h your God has chosen to minister to him , and to b@@ less in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stro@@ ke be .
all the el@@ ders of that city , who are near@@ est to the sla@@ in man , shall was@@ h their hands over the he@@ if@@ er whose nec@@ k was broken in the val@@ ley ;
for@@ give , Yah@@ we@@ h , your people Israel , whom you have re@@ deemed , and don '@@ t allow innocent blood in the mid@@ st of your people Israel . " the blood shall be for@@ given them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the mid@@ st of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h .
when you go forth to battle against your enem@@ ies , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God deli@@ vers them into your hands , and you carry them away cap@@ tive ,
and see among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
it shall be , if you have no de@@ light in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a sla@@ ve , because you have hum@@ b@@ led her .
if a man have two wi@@ ves , the one bel@@ ov@@ ed , and the other ha@@ ted , and they have bor@@ ne him children , both the bel@@ ov@@ ed and the ha@@ ted ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers who was ha@@ ted ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inher@@ it that which he has , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed the fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , who is the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they ch@@ as@@ ten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the el@@ ders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the el@@ ders of his city , " This our son is st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous , he will not obe@@ y our voice ; he is a gl@@ ut@@ ton , and a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
his body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall su@@ rely bur@@ y him the same day ; for he who is han@@ ged is accur@@ sed of God ; that you don '@@ t def@@ ile your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
so you shall do with his don@@ key ; and so you shall do with his gar@@ ment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yo@@ ur@@ self .
a woman shall not wear men 's clo@@ thing , neither shall a man put on women 's clo@@ thing ; for who@@ ever does these things is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eg@@ gs , and the h@@ en sitting on the young , or on the eg@@ gs , you shall not take the h@@ en with the young :
you shall su@@ rely let the h@@ en go , but the young you may take to yo@@ ur@@ self ; that it may be well with you , and that you may prol@@ ong your days .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a batt@@ lement for your ro@@ of , that you don '@@ t bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not so@@ w your v@@ ine@@ yard with two kinds of se@@ ed , lest the whole fruit be for@@ fe@@ ited , the se@@ ed which you have so@@ wn , and the increase of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
and acc@@ uses her of sha@@ me@@ ful things , and brings up an ev@@ il name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find in her the to@@ ken@@ s of vir@@ gin@@ ity " ;
then shall the father of the young la@@ dy , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the young la@@ dy 's vir@@ gin@@ ity to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
if there is a young la@@ dy who is a vir@@ gin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the la@@ dy who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the la@@ dy you shall do nothing ; there is in the la@@ dy no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man rises against his neigh@@ bor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
for he found her in the field , the pledged to be married la@@ dy cri@@ ed , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a la@@ dy who is a vir@@ gin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the la@@ dy 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ b@@ led her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or from P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se you .
you shall not ab@@ h@@ or an E@@ dom@@ ite ; for he is your brother : you shall not ab@@ h@@ or an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreig@@ ner in his land .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall ba@@ the himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
and you shall have a p@@ add@@ le among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall di@@ g there@@ with , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God walk@@ s in the mid@@ st of your camp , to deliver you , and to give up your enem@@ ies before you ; therefore your camp shall be hol@@ y , that he may not see an un@@ clean thing in you , and turn away from you .
he shall d@@ well with you , in the mid@@ st of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it ple@@ ases him best : you shall not op@@ press him .
you shall not bring the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a do@@ g , into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
to a foreig@@ ner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God may b@@ less you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be S@@ lack to pay it : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God will su@@ rely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your li@@ ps you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , a fre@@ e@@ will offering , which you have promised with your m@@ outh .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then you may eat of grap@@ es your fill at your own pleas@@ ure ; but you shall not put any in your ves@@ sel .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's standing gra@@ in , then you may p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars with your hand ; but you shall not move a si@@ ck@@ le to your neigh@@ bor 's standing gra@@ in .
when a man takes a wife , and mar@@ ries her , then it shall be , if she find no fav@@ or in his eyes , because he has found some un@@ seem@@ ly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
when a man takes a new wife , he shall not go out in the army , neither shall he be assigned any business : he shall be free at home one year , and shall che@@ er his wife whom he has taken .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a sla@@ ve , or sell him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that you observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so you shall observe to do .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall not op@@ press a hired ser@@ vant who is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
in his day you shall give him his h@@ ire , neither shall the sun go down on it ; for he is poor , and sets his heart on it : lest he cry against you to Yah@@ we@@ h , and it be sin to you .
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but you shall remember that you were a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant in Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God re@@ deemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you har@@ v@@ est your v@@ ine@@ yard , you shall not g@@ le@@ an it after yo@@ ur@@ selves : it shall be for the foreig@@ ner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , by number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then your brother should seem v@@ ile to you .
it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born whom she be@@ ars shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blo@@ t@@ ted out of Israel .
then the el@@ ders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don '@@ t want to take her " ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secre@@ ts ;
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hin@@ d@@ most of you , all who were fe@@ e@@ ble behind you , when you were fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , and poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in ,
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a bas@@ ket , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
you shall come to the pri@@ est who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I prof@@ ess this day to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , that I am come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers to give us . "
the pri@@ est shall take the bas@@ ket out of your hand , and set it down before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
and we cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fa@@ thers , and Yah@@ we@@ h heard our voice , and saw our aff@@ li@@ ction , and our to@@ il , and our op@@ pression ;
and Yah@@ we@@ h brought us forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with won@@ ders ;
now , be@@ hold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yah@@ we@@ h , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and worship before Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all the good which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you .
look down from your hol@@ y habi@@ tation , from heav@@ en , and b@@ less your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey . "
this day Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ds you to do these stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l .
you have declared Yah@@ we@@ h this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and listen to his voice :
and Yah@@ we@@ h has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments ;
and to make you high above all nations that he has made , in praise , and in name , and in hon@@ or ; and that you may be a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as he has spoken .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , that you shall set yo@@ ur@@ self up great stones , and plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount E@@ bal , and you shall plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter .
there you shall build an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , an alt@@ ar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God of un@@ cut stones ; and you shall offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on to Yah@@ we@@ h your God :
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God will set you on high above all the nations of the ear@@ th :
and all these b@@ les@@ s@@ ings shall come on you , and over@@ take you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall be b@@ les@@ sed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the young of your flock .
Yah@@ we@@ h will command the b@@ les@@ sing on you in your bar@@ ns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will b@@ less you in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
all the peoples of the ear@@ th shall see that you are called by the name of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they shall be afraid of you .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make you the head , and not the ta@@ il ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be ben@@ e@@ ath ; if you shall listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other go@@ ds to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the young of your flock shall be Cur@@ sed .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce cling to you , until he has consu@@ med you from off the land , where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with consumption , and with f@@ ever , and with inf@@ lam@@ mation , and with fi@@ ery heat , and with the s@@ word , and with b@@ light , and with mil@@ dew ; and they shall pursue you until you per@@ ish .
your sky that is over your head shall be br@@ ass , and the ear@@ th that is under you shall be iron .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make the rain of your land pow@@ der and d@@ ust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cause you to be struck before your enem@@ ies ; you shall go out one way against them , and shall flee seven ways before them : and you shall be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th ; and there shall be none to fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with the bo@@ il of Egypt , and with the t@@ um@@ ors , and with the s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , and with the it@@ ch , of which you can not be he@@ aled .
and you shall gro@@ pe at no@@ on@@ day , as the b@@ lin@@ d gro@@ pes in d@@ ark@@ ness , and you shall not prosp@@ er in your ways : and you shall be only op@@ pressed and ro@@ bbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not d@@ well there@@ in : you shall plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and shall not use its fruit .
your o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your don@@ key shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your she@@ ep shall be given to your enem@@ ies , and you shall have none to save you .
your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your la@@ b@@ ors , shall a nation which you don '@@ t know eat up ; and you shall be only op@@ pressed and cr@@ us@@ hed always ;
so that you shall be ma@@ d for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bo@@ il , of which you can not be he@@ aled , from the sole of your fo@@ ot to the cro@@ wn of your head .
Yah@@ we@@ h will bring you , and your king whom you shall set over you , to a nation that you have not known , you nor your fa@@ thers ; and there you shall serve other go@@ ds , wood and stone .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not ano@@ int yo@@ ur@@ self with the oil ; for your ol@@ ives shall drop off .
the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and over@@ take you , until you are destroyed ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which he comman@@ ded you :
because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t serve Yah@@ we@@ h your God with jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , and with gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , by reason of the ab@@ und@@ ance of all things ;
they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates , until your high and for@@ ti@@ fied walls come down , in which you tr@@ usted , throughout all your land ; and they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the f@@ les@@ h of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enemy shall dist@@ ress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , Y@@ A@@ H@@ W@@ E@@ H your God ;
then Yah@@ we@@ h will make your plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of your se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and severe si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every si@@ ck@@ ness , and every pla@@ gue , which is not written in the book of this law , Yah@@ we@@ h will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multi@@ tude ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
it shall happen that as Yah@@ we@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you , so Yah@@ we@@ h will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to cause you to per@@ ish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will sc@@ at@@ ter you among all peoples , from the one end of the ear@@ th even to the other end of the ear@@ th ; and there you shall serve other go@@ ds , which you have not known , you nor your fa@@ thers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your fo@@ ot : but Yah@@ we@@ h will give you there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of sou@@ l ;
and your life shall han@@ g in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assur@@ ance of your life .
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , besides the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
Mos@@ es called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yah@@ we@@ h did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
I have led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : your clo@@ th@@ es have not grown old on you , and your sho@@ es have not grown old on your feet .
when you came to this place , S@@ ih@@ on the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inher@@ it@@ ance to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the Man@@ as@@ sites .
that you may enter into the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and into his oath , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God makes with you this day ;
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the mid@@ st of the nations through which you passed ;
Yah@@ we@@ h will set him apart to ev@@ il out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that is written in this book of the law .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreig@@ ner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses with which Yah@@ we@@ h has made it si@@ ck ;
then men shall say , " Bec@@ ause they for@@ so@@ ok the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Yah@@ we@@ h rooted them out of their land in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l ;
that then Yah@@ we@@ h your God will turn your cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has sc@@ at@@ tered you .
if your out@@ casts are in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the heav@@ ens , from there will Yah@@ we@@ h your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yah@@ we@@ h your God will bring you into the land which your fa@@ thers poss@@ essed , and you shall poss@@ ess it ; and he will do you good , and multi@@ ply you above your fa@@ thers .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will circum@@ c@@ ise your heart , and the heart of your se@@ ed , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , that you may live .
if you shall obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l .
it is not in heav@@ en , that you should say , " Wh@@ o shall go up for us to heav@@ en , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
neither is it beyond the sea , that you should say , " Wh@@ o shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
but the word is very near to you , in your m@@ outh , and in your heart , that you may do it .
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other go@@ ds , and serve them ;
I den@@ oun@@ ce to you this day , that you shall su@@ rely per@@ ish ; you shall not prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess them . Jos@@ hua shall go over before you , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
Yah@@ we@@ h will do to them as he did to S@@ ih@@ on and to O@@ g , the kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
Yah@@ we@@ h will deliver them up before you , and you shall do to them according to all the comman@@ d@@ ment which I have comman@@ ded you .
be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous , don '@@ t be afraid , nor be scar@@ ed of them : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor for@@ sake you . "
Yah@@ we@@ h , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither for@@ sake you : D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
Mos@@ es comman@@ ded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of ten@@ ts ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
assem@@ ble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreig@@ ner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ il which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other go@@ ds .
" now therefore write this song for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and te@@ ach it to the children of Israel : put it in their m@@ ou@@ ths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to their fa@@ thers , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and grown f@@ at ; then will they turn to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and desp@@ ise me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
it happened , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
" take this book of the law , and put it by the side of the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , that it may be there for a witness against you .
assem@@ ble to me all the el@@ ders of your tri@@ bes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their e@@ ars , and call heav@@ en and ear@@ th to witness against them .
Mos@@ es spoke in the e@@ ars of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
my doc@@ tr@@ ine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall con@@ den@@ se as the dew , as the small rain on the tender gr@@ ass , as the sho@@ wers on the her@@ b .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your el@@ ders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bo@@ unds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yah@@ we@@ h 's portion is his people . Jac@@ o@@ b is the lot of his inher@@ it@@ ance .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
but J@@ es@@ hur@@ un grew f@@ at , and kicked . you have grown f@@ at . you have grown th@@ ick . you have become sle@@ ek . then he for@@ so@@ ok God who made him , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed the Rock of his sal@@ vation .
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to dem@@ ons , not God , to go@@ ds that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , to new go@@ ds that came up recently , which your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dre@@ ad .
of the Rock who became your father , you are un@@ min@@ d@@ ful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very per@@ verse generation , children in whom is no fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness .
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God . they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities . I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those who are not a people . I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
they shall be was@@ ted with hunger , and dev@@ oured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the te@@ eth of animals on them , With the po@@ ison of cra@@ w@@ ling things of the d@@ ust .
were it not that I fear@@ ed the provoc@@ ation of the enemy , lest their ad@@ vers@@ aries should judge wron@@ gly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is ex@@ al@@ ted , Yah@@ we@@ h has not done all this . ' "
for their v@@ ine is of the v@@ ine of So@@ dom , of the fields of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h . their grap@@ es are grap@@ es of g@@ all , The@@ ir clu@@ sters are bitter .
ven@@ ge@@ ance is mine , and re@@ compen@@ se , at the time when their fo@@ ot sli@@ des ; for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make has@@ te . "
for Yah@@ we@@ h will judge his people , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on his servants , when he sees that their power is gone , There is none remaining , shut up or left at large .
if I wh@@ et my g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to my ad@@ vers@@ aries , and will re@@ compen@@ se those who h@@ ate me .
I will make my ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood . my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h with the blood of the sla@@ in and the cap@@ tives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
re@@ jo@@ ice , you nations , with his people , for he will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of his servants . he will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , An@@ d will make exp@@ iation for his land , for his people .
Mos@@ es came and spoke all the words of this song in the e@@ ars of the people , he and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
for it is no v@@ ain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
" go up into this mountain of A@@ bar@@ im , to Mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and see the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount H@@ or , and was gathered to his people :
because you t@@ res@@ passed against me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
this is the b@@ les@@ sing , with which Mos@@ es the man of God b@@ les@@ sed the children of Israel before his death .
who said of his father , and of his mother , ' I have not seen him ; ' Ne@@ ither did he acknowledge his brothers , N@@ or did he know his own children : for they have observed your word , and keep your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for they shall draw out the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the s@@ and . "
Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b to Mount N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . Yah@@ we@@ h showed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to Dan ,
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " This is the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
Jos@@ hua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wis@@ dom ; for Mos@@ es had laid his hands on him : and the children of Israel list@@ ened to him , and did as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
in all the signs and the won@@ ders , which Yah@@ we@@ h sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
now it happened after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' ser@@ vant , saying ,
" Mos@@ es my ser@@ vant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Mos@@ es , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor for@@ sake you .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of your m@@ outh , but you shall medi@@ t@@ ate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
who@@ ever rebels against your comman@@ d@@ ment , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous . "
it happened about the time of the sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don '@@ t know . pursue them quickly ; for you will over@@ take them . "
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order on the ro@@ of .
the men pursu@@ ed them the way to the Jordan to the for@@ ds : and as soon as those who pursu@@ ed them had gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said to the men , " I know that Yah@@ we@@ h has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land mel@@ t away before you .
as soon as we had heard it , our hear@@ ts mel@@ ted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heav@@ en above , and on ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath .
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , you shall bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yo@@ ur@@ self into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guil@@ t@@ less of your oath which you have made us to swe@@ ar . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursu@@ ers had returned . the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them .
then the two men returned , des@@ cen@@ ded from the mountain , passed over , and came to Jos@@ hua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Sh@@ it@@ tim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lo@@ d@@ ged there before they passed over .
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , " When you see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then you shall move from your place , and follow it .
Jos@@ hua spoke to the pri@@ ests , saying , " T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and pass over before the people . " they took up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and went before the people .
you shall command the pri@@ ests who bear the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , saying , ' When you come to the br@@ ink of the waters of the Jordan , you shall stand still in the Jordan . ' "
Jos@@ hua said , " Her@@ e@@ by you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite out from before you .
it happened , when the people moved from their ten@@ ts to pass over the Jordan , the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant being before the people ,
and when those who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had di@@ pped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan over@@ flows all its banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est ) ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
Jos@@ hua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h passed over , with the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the children of G@@ ad , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Mos@@ es spoke to them .
it happened , when the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up to the d@@ ry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ ilg@@ al , on the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God dri@@ ed up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God did to the Red Sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circum@@ c@@ ised ; but all the people who were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circum@@ c@@ ised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circum@@ c@@ ised by Jos@@ hua ; for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circum@@ c@@ ising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were he@@ aled .
the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the next day , after they had e@@ aten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have man@@ na any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
it was so , that when Jos@@ hua had spoken to the people , the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns before Yah@@ we@@ h advanced , and ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h followed them .
so he caused the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lo@@ d@@ ged in the camp .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and mar@@ ched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they mar@@ ched around the city seven times .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yah@@ we@@ h . only Ra@@ ha@@ b the pro@@ stitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
but as for you , only keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accur@@ sed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of br@@ ass and iron , are hol@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h . they shall come into Yah@@ we@@ h 's treas@@ ury . "
Jos@@ hua said to the two men who had sp@@ ied out the land , " G@@ o into the pro@@ stitute 's house , and bring out from there the woman and all that she has , as you s@@ wor@@ e to her . "
the young men who were sp@@ ies went in , and brought out Ra@@ ha@@ b with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron into the treas@@ ury of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but Ra@@ ha@@ b the pro@@ stitute , her father 's household , and all that she had , Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed alive . she lived in the mid@@ st of Israel to this day , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , whom Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the devoted things ; for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger burned against the children of Israel .
Jos@@ hua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ I , which is bes@@ ide Beth Av@@ en , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and spoke to them , saying , " G@@ o up and sp@@ y out the land . " the men went up and sp@@ ied out A@@ I .
the men of A@@ I struck about thirty @@@ -@@ @ six men of them , and they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even to She@@ bar@@ im , and struck them at the des@@ cent . the hear@@ ts of the people mel@@ ted , and became like water .
Jos@@ hua said , " A@@ las , Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to cause us to per@@ ish ? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan !
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he has , because he has trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because he has done a dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful thing in Israel . ' "
he brought near the family of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he selected the family of the Zer@@ a@@ hi@@ tes . he brought near the family of the Zer@@ a@@ hi@@ tes man by man , and Z@@ ab@@ di was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was selected .
so Jos@@ hua sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and they ran to the tent . be@@ hold , it was hidden in his tent , with the silver under it .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Jos@@ hua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up to A@@ I . Jos@@ hua chose thirty thousand men , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , and sent them out by night .
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " be@@ hold , you shall lie in amb@@ ush against the city , behind the city . D@@ on '@@ t go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I have comman@@ ded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and en@@ camp@@ ed on the north side of A@@ I . now there was a val@@ ley between him and A@@ I .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursu@@ ed Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in A@@ I or Beth El who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursu@@ ed Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Jos@@ hua , " St@@ ret@@ ch out the j@@ av@@ elin that is in your hand toward A@@ I , for I will give it into your hand . " Jos@@ hua stret@@ ched out the j@@ av@@ elin that was in his hand toward the city .
the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
when Jos@@ hua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city as@@ cen@@ ded , then they turned again , and killed the men of A@@ I .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in which they pursu@@ ed them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all Israel returned to A@@ I , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word .
for Jos@@ hua di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw back his hand , with which he stret@@ ched out the j@@ av@@ elin , until he had ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ I .
only the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and the sp@@ oil of that city Israel took for pre@@ y to themselves , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua .
he wrote there on the stones a cop@@ y of the law of Mos@@ es , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
after@@ ward he read all the words of the law , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the low@@ land , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , heard of it
they also res@@ or@@ ted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ ke@@ ys , and win@@ esk@@ ins , old and torn and bound up ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes who were beyond the Jordan , to S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and to O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , who was at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and has become m@@ ol@@ dy .
these win@@ esk@@ ins , which we filled , were new ; and be@@ hold , they are torn . these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that they heard that they were their neigh@@ b@@ ors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t strike them , because the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation had sworn to them by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel . all the Con@@ gre@@ gation mur@@ mu@@ red against the pr@@ inces .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wr@@ ath be on us , because of the oath which we s@@ wor@@ e to them . "
Jos@@ hua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Wh@@ y have you dec@@ e@@ ived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now , be@@ hold , we are in your hand . do to us as it seems good and right to you to do . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill them .
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and en@@ camp@@ ed against Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
so Jos@@ hua went up from G@@ ilg@@ al , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
Yah@@ we@@ h conf@@ used them before Israel , and he killed them with a great sla@@ ughter at Gi@@ be@@ on , and ch@@ ased them by the way of the as@@ cent of Beth Hor@@ on , and struck them to Az@@ ek@@ ah and to Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah .
but don '@@ t stay . pursue your enem@@ ies , and them from the re@@ ar . D@@ on '@@ t allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great sla@@ ughter until they were consu@@ med , and the re@@ mn@@ ant which remained of them had entered into the for@@ ti@@ fied cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king and all its cities , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed it , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it .
it happened , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or heard of it , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Ara@@ bah south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , in the low@@ land , and in the he@@ ights of D@@ or on the west ,
to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the hill country , and the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the s@@ and that is on the se@@ ash@@ ore in multi@@ tude , with very many hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and ch@@ ased them to great S@@ id@@ on , and to Mis@@ rep@@ ho@@ th Ma@@ im , and to the val@@ ley of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
they struck all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it with the edge of the s@@ word , ut@@ ter@@ ly destroying them . there was no one left who bre@@ ath@@ ed . he bur@@ n@@ t Haz@@ or with fire .
Jos@@ hua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them ; as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded .
the children of Israel took all the sp@@ oil of these cities , with the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as sp@@ o@@ ils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave any who bre@@ ath@@ ed .
for it was of Yah@@ we@@ h to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them , that they might have no fav@@ or , but that he might destroy them , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
Jos@@ hua came at that time , and cut off the An@@ ak@@ im from the hill country , from He@@ br@@ on , from De@@ bir , from An@@ a@@ b , and from all the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from all the hill country of Israel : Jos@@ hua ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them with their cities .
there were none of the An@@ ak@@ im left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , did some remain .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and poss@@ essed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sun@@ rise , from the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon , and all the Ara@@ bah eas@@ tw@@ ard :
and the border of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im , who lived at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
and ruled in Mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ec@@ ah , and in all B@@ ash@@ an , to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites , and half G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the border of S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon .
Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h and the children of Israel struck them . Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it for a possession to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the king of D@@ or in the he@@ ight of D@@ or , one ; the king of Go@@ i@@ im in G@@ ilg@@ al , one ;
on the south ; all the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and M@@ ear@@ ah that belongs to the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , to A@@ ph@@ ek , to the border of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ;
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba to Di@@ bon ;
and all the cities of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who re@@ ig@@ ned in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , to the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites : but G@@ es@@ hur and Ma@@ ac@@ ath d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inher@@ it@@ ance to the tri@@ be of L@@ evi . the offer@@ ings of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inher@@ it@@ ance , as he spoke to him .
their border was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
the children of Israel al@@ se killed Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ er , with the s@@ word , among the rest of their sla@@ in .
the border of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en was the bank of the Jordan . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Mos@@ es gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . it was for the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families .
these are the inher@@ it@@ ances which the children of Israel took in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , distributed to them ,
I was for@@ ty years old when Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h sent me from K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea to sp@@ y out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
" now , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has kept me alive , as he spoke , these for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years , from the time that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke this word to Mos@@ es , while Israel walked in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . now , be@@ hold , I am eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the lot for the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea , and passed along by H@@ ez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
and it passed along to Az@@ mon , went out at the Bro@@ ok of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Sal@@ t Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border went up to Beth Ho@@ g@@ lah , and passed along by the north of Beth Ara@@ bah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the border went up to De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En She@@ mes@@ h , and ended at En Ro@@ gel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount J@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
and the border went out to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border extended to Shi@@ k@@ ker@@ on , and passed along to Mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out at J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
the west border was to the shore of the great sea . this is the border of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their families .
to Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h he gave a portion among the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h to Jos@@ hua , even Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba , named after the father of An@@ ak ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) .
from E@@ kr@@ on even to the sea , all that were by the side of Ash@@ do@@ d , with their villages .
Ash@@ do@@ d , its towns and its villages ; Gaza , its towns and its villages ; to the Bro@@ ok of Egypt , and the great sea with its coastline .
as for the Je@@ bu@@ sites , the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , the children of Ju@@ da@@ h co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive them out ; but the Je@@ bu@@ sites live with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h at Jer@@ usalem to this day .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o , at the waters of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , even the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , going up from Jer@@ ich@@ o through the hill country to Be@@ the@@ l .
it went out from Be@@ the@@ l to L@@ uz , and passed along to the border of the Archi@@ tes to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th ;
and it went down w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the border of the Jap@@ h@@ leti@@ tes , to the border of Beth Hor@@ on the lower , even to Ge@@ zer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families . the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance eas@@ tw@@ ard was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , to Beth Hor@@ on the up@@ per .
the border went out w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard at Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ath on the north . the border turned about eas@@ tw@@ ard to Ta@@ an@@ ath Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and passed along it on the east of Jan@@ o@@ ah .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the Bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in the mid@@ st of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , all the cities with their villages .
this was the lot for the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph . as for Mac@@ hir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , because he was a man of war , therefore he had G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an .
so this was for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families : for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph according to their families .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of Hep@@ her , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and these are the names of his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : Mah@@ lah , No@@ ah , Ho@@ g@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from As@@ her to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ath , which is before Sh@@ ec@@ hem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah .
the border went down to the Bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the Bro@@ ok . these cities belonged to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was on the north side of the Bro@@ ok , and ended at the sea .
sou@@ th@@ ward it was E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's , and nor@@ th@@ ward it was Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's , and the sea was his border . they reached to As@@ her on the north , and to Is@@ sac@@ har on the east .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had three he@@ ights in Is@@ sac@@ har , in As@@ her Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced la@@ bor , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
Jos@@ hua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel assemb@@ led themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and set up the tent of Meet@@ ing there . the land was sub@@ du@@ ed before them .
appoint for yo@@ ur@@ selves three men from each tri@@ be . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inher@@ it@@ ance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven por@@ tions . Ju@@ da@@ h shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north , and went up through the hill country w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . it ended at the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Beth Av@@ en .
the border passed along from there to L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz ( the same is Be@@ the@@ l ) , sou@@ th@@ ward . the border went down to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Hor@@ on the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter sou@@ th@@ ward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and ended at Kiri@@ ath Ba@@ al ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h . this was the west quarter .
the south quarter was from the far@@ th@@ est part of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im . the border went out w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and went out to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah .
it extended nor@@ th@@ ward , went out at En She@@ mes@@ h , and went out to Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im . it went down to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the border passed along to the side of Beth Ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Sal@@ t Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . this was the south border .
Ze@@ lah , Ele@@ p@@ h , the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite ( the same is Jer@@ usalem ) , Gi@@ be@@ ath , and Kiri@@ ath ; fo@@ ur@@ teen cities with their villages . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
the second lot came out for Simeon , even for the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families . their inher@@ it@@ ance was in the mid@@ st of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h .
out of the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inher@@ it@@ ance in the mid@@ st of their inher@@ it@@ ance .
their border went up w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , even to Mar@@ al@@ ah , and reached to Dab@@ bes@@ het@@ h . it reached to the Bro@@ ok that is before Jok@@ ne@@ am .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har according to their families , the cities with their villages .
it turned toward the sun@@ rise to Beth D@@ agon , and reached to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of I@@ ph@@ ta@@ h El nor@@ th@@ ward to Beth E@@ mek and Ne@@ i@@ el . it went out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
the border turned to Ram@@ ah , to the for@@ ti@@ fied city of T@@ y@@ re ; and the border turned to Hos@@ ah . it ended at the sea by the region of A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b ;
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out for the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , even for the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families , the cities with their villages .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
so they made an end of distribut@@ ing the land for inher@@ it@@ ance by its borders . the children of Israel gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to Jos@@ hua the son of nun in their mid@@ st .
according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ n@@ ath@@ ser@@ ah in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
they set apart K@@ ede@@ sh in Gal@@ il@@ ee in the hill country of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) in the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h .
the children of Israel gave to the L@@ evi@@ tes out of their inher@@ it@@ ance , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , these cities with their subur@@ bs .
the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites . the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , who were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , out of the tri@@ be of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin .
the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an .
the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi ; for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
they gave them Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba , named after the father of An@@ ak ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) , in the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h , with its subur@@ bs around it .
to the children of Aaron the pri@@ est they gave He@@ br@@ on with its subur@@ bs , the city of ref@@ uge for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , Lib@@ n@@ ah with its subur@@ bs ,
the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes , even the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
they gave to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with its subur@@ bs , the city of ref@@ uge for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , and Be E@@ sh@@ ter@@ ah with its subur@@ bs ; two cities .
to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with its subur@@ bs , Kar@@ ta@@ h with its subur@@ bs ,
all these were the cities of the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families , even the rest of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes . their lot was twelve cities .
all the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes in the mid@@ st of the possession of the children of Israel were for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight cities with their subur@@ bs .
Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around , according to all that he s@@ wor@@ e to their fa@@ thers . not a man of all their enem@@ ies stood before them . Yah@@ we@@ h delivered all their enem@@ ies into their hand .
now to the one half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Mos@@ es had given inher@@ it@@ ance in B@@ ash@@ an ; but to the other half gave Jos@@ hua among their brothers beyond the Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . moreover when Jos@@ hua sent them away to their ten@@ ts , he b@@ les@@ sed them ,
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by the Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " be@@ hold , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that per@@ tains to the children of Israel . "
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and with him ten pr@@ inces , one pr@@ ince of a fa@@ thers ' house for each of the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fa@@ thers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
they came to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" thus says the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h , ' What t@@ res@@ pass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Yah@@ we@@ h , in that you have built yo@@ ur@@ selves an alt@@ ar , to rebel this day against Yah@@ we@@ h ?
is the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we have not cleans@@ ed ourselves to this day , although there came a pla@@ gue on the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yah@@ we@@ h ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yah@@ we@@ h , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
then the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h answ@@ ered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn away from following Yah@@ we@@ h ; or if to offer bur@@ n@@ t offering or me@@ al offering , or if to offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of peace offer@@ ings , let Yah@@ we@@ h himself require it .
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ?
for Yah@@ we@@ h has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Re@@ ub@@ en and children of G@@ ad . you have no portion in Yah@@ we@@ h . " ' so your children might make our children ce@@ ase from fearing Yah@@ we@@ h .
when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h spoke , it pleased them well .
Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will th@@ rust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall poss@@ ess their land , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God spoke to you .
" therefore be very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ;
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ selves to them ;
" for Yah@@ we@@ h has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
Jos@@ hua gathered all the tri@@ bes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the el@@ ders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
" ' I sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its mid@@ st : and after@@ ward I brought you out .
when they cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h , he put d@@ ark@@ ness between you and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and brought the sea on them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt : and you lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness many days .
" ' I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you poss@@ essed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o . the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dro@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; not with your s@@ word , nor with your bo@@ w .
Jos@@ hua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the o@@ ak that was by the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of Yah@@ we@@ h .
Jos@@ hua said to all the people , " be@@ hold , this stone shall be a witness against us ; for it has heard all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to us . it shall be therefore a witness against you , lest you deny your God . "
it happened after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath@@ ser@@ ah , which is in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north of the mountain of G@@ a@@ ash .
Israel served Yah@@ we@@ h all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders who out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , and had known all the work of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he had worked for Israel .
it happened after the death of Jos@@ hua , the children of Israel asked of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Wh@@ o should go up for us first against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , to fight against them ? "
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h fought against Jer@@ usalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
after@@ ward the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the low@@ land .
Ju@@ da@@ h went against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in He@@ br@@ on ( now the name of He@@ br@@ on before was Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ) ; and they struck Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Ah@@ im@@ an , and Tal@@ ma@@ i .
the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which is in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and lived with the people .
Yah@@ we@@ h was with Ju@@ da@@ h ; and dro@@ ve out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the val@@ ley , because they had char@@ i@@ ots of iron .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Je@@ bu@@ sites who inhabited Jer@@ usalem ; but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Benjamin in Jer@@ usalem to this day .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and built a city , and called its name L@@ uz , which is its name to this day .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced la@@ bor , and did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
Ze@@ bul@@ un di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Kit@@ ron , nor the inhabitants of Na@@ hal@@ ol ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites lived among them , and became subject to forced la@@ bor .
As@@ her di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Ac@@ co , nor the inhabitants of S@@ id@@ on , nor of Ah@@ lab , nor of A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b , nor of Hel@@ bah , nor of Ap@@ hi@@ k , nor of Re@@ ho@@ b ;
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth An@@ ath ; but he lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h and of Beth An@@ ath became subject to forced la@@ bor .
the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the val@@ ley ;
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in Mount Her@@ es , in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became subject to forced la@@ bor .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , ' I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you :
and you shall make no C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s . ' but you have not list@@ ened to my voice : why have you done this ?
it happened , when the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
the people served Yah@@ we@@ h all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders who out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great work of Yah@@ we@@ h that he had worked for Israel .
they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath Her@@ es , in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north of the mountain of G@@ a@@ ash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fa@@ thers : and there ar@@ ose another generation after them , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the peoples who were around them , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers who desp@@ o@@ iled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
wher@@ ever they went out , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against them for ev@@ il , as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken , and as Yah@@ we@@ h had sworn to them : and they were very dist@@ ressed .
yet they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to their judges ; for they played the pro@@ stitute after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fa@@ thers walked , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do so .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel ; and he said , " Bec@@ ause this nation have trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I comman@@ ded their fa@@ thers , and have not list@@ ened to my voice ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yah@@ we@@ h to walk there@@ in , as their fa@@ thers kept it , or not . "
the five lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Ba@@ al Her@@ mon to the entrance of Ham@@ ath .
the children of Israel lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites :
the children of Israel did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for@@ got Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ ero@@ th .
when the children of Israel cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , Yah@@ we@@ h raised up a Sav@@ ior to the children of Israel , who sav@@ ed them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Yah@@ we@@ h strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
but when the children of Israel cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , Yah@@ we@@ h raised them up a Sav@@ ior , E@@ h@@ ud the son of Ger@@ a , the Benj@@ am@@ ite , a man left @@@ -@@ @ handed . the children of Israel sent tri@@ bute by him to Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b .
E@@ h@@ ud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the co@@ ol up@@ per room . E@@ h@@ ud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and the handle also went in after the bla@@ de ; and the f@@ at closed on the bla@@ de , for he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw the s@@ word out of his body ; and it came out behind .
now when he was gone out , his servants came ; and they saw , and be@@ hold , the doors of the up@@ per room were locked ; and they said , " su@@ rely he is covering his feet in the up@@ per room . "
they w@@ aited until they were as@@ ha@@ med ; and be@@ hold , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open the doors of the up@@ per room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
it happened , when he had come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , every lu@@ st@@ y man , and every man of val@@ or ; and there escaped not a man .
she lived under the pal@@ m tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
now He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite had separated himself from the Ken@@ ites , even from the children of H@@ ob@@ a@@ b the brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Mos@@ es , and had pit@@ ched his tent as far as the o@@ ak in Za@@ an@@ ann@@ im , which is by K@@ ede@@ sh .
Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
Yah@@ we@@ h conf@@ used Sis@@ era , and all his char@@ i@@ ots , and all his army , with the edge of the s@@ word before B@@ arak ; and Sis@@ era al@@ igh@@ ted from his char@@ i@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the army , to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the army of Sis@@ era fell by the edge of the s@@ word ; there was not a man left .
however Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
Ja@@ el went out to meet Sis@@ era , and said to him , " Tur@@ n in , my lor@@ d , turn in to me ; don '@@ t be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a ru@@ g .
he said to her , " St@@ and in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inqu@@ ires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
the hand of the children of Israel prev@@ ailed more and more against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
" hear , you kings ! give e@@ ar , you pr@@ inces ! I , even I , will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h . I will sing praise to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
" Yah@@ we@@ h , when you went forth out of Se@@ ir , when you mar@@ ched out of the field of E@@ dom , the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , the sky also dropped . yes , the cl@@ ou@@ ds dropped water .
the mountains qu@@ aked at the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , even S@@ ina@@ i , at the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Sh@@ am@@ gar the son of An@@ ath , in the days of Ja@@ el , the highways were un@@ occupied . the travel@@ ers walked through by@@ ways .
" speak , you who ride on white don@@ ke@@ ys , you who sit on rich car@@ p@@ ets , and you who walk by the way .
far from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers , in the places of drawing water , there they will re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of Yah@@ we@@ h , the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yah@@ we@@ h went down to the gates .
those whose root is in A@@ mal@@ ek came out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . govern@@ ors come down out of Mac@@ hir . those who handle the mar@@ sh@@ al 's staff came out of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
the pr@@ inces of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah . as was Is@@ sac@@ har , so was B@@ arak . they rushed into the val@@ ley at his feet . by the water@@ courses of Re@@ ub@@ en , there were great resol@@ ves of heart .
Ze@@ bul@@ un was a people that jeop@@ ar@@ diz@@ ed their lives to the deaths ; Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i also , on the high places of the field .
she put her hand to the tent pe@@ g , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer . with the ham@@ mer she struck Sis@@ era . she struck through his head . yes , she pi@@ er@@ ced and struck through his temp@@ les .
at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell . where he bo@@ wed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cri@@ ed : Sis@@ era 's mother looked through the lat@@ tice . ' why is his char@@ i@@ ot so long in coming ? why do the whe@@ els of his char@@ i@@ ots wait ? '
" so let all your enem@@ ies per@@ ish , Yah@@ we@@ h , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest for@@ ty years .
the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel ; and because of Mi@@ dian the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and the c@@ aves , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and they en@@ camp@@ ed against them , and destroyed the increase of the ear@@ th , until you come to Gaza , and left no sust@@ en@@ ance in Israel , neither she@@ ep , nor o@@ x , nor don@@ key .
for they came up with their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and their ten@@ ts ; they came in as loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; both they and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
that Yah@@ we@@ h sent a pro@@ phe@@ t to the children of Israel : and he said to them , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all who op@@ pressed you , and dro@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said to you , " I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall not fear the go@@ ds of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in whose land you d@@ well . " but you have not list@@ ened to my voice . ' "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
G@@ ide@@ on went in , and prepared a young go@@ at , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of an ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al . he put the meat in a bas@@ ket and he put the bro@@ th in a po@@ t , and brought it out to him under the o@@ ak , and presented it .
and build an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this stron@@ gh@@ old , in an or@@ derly way , and take the second bul@@ l , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken to him : and it happened , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was broken down , and the Ash@@ er@@ ah was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ l was offered on the alt@@ ar that was built .
then the men of the city said to Jo@@ ash , " Br@@ ing out your son , that he may die , because he has broken down the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al , and because he has cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah that was by it . "
he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers throughout all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to As@@ her , and to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i ; and they came up to meet them .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol on the th@@ res@@ hing floor ; if there is dew on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it is d@@ ry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the F@@ le@@ ece together , and wr@@ ung the dew out of the F@@ le@@ ece , a bo@@ w@@ l full of water .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and en@@ camp@@ ed bes@@ ide the spring of Har@@ od : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " Every@@ one who la@@ ps of the water with his ton@@ gue , like a do@@ g la@@ ps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bo@@ ws down on his k@@ ne@@ es to drink . "
the number of those who la@@ pped , putting their hand to their m@@ outh , was three hundred men ; but all the rest of the people bo@@ wed down on their k@@ ne@@ es to drink water .
and you shall hear what they say ; and after@@ ward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Pur@@ ah his ser@@ vant to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore for multi@@ tude .
it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and its interpre@@ tation , that he wor@@ shi@@ ped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has delivered the army of Mi@@ dian into your hand ! "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them tr@@ ump@@ ets , and empty pit@@ chers , with tor@@ ches within the pit@@ chers .
when I blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , I and all who are with me , then blow the tr@@ ump@@ ets also on every side of all the camp , and sh@@ out , ' For Yah@@ we@@ h and for G@@ ide@@ on ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they sh@@ ou@@ ted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after Mi@@ dian .
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said to him , " Wh@@ y have you treated us this way , that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t call us , when you went to fight with Mi@@ dian ? " they re@@ bu@@ ked him sharply .
God has delivered into your hand the pr@@ inces of Mi@@ dian , O@@ re@@ b and Ze@@ e@@ b ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their an@@ ger was ab@@ ated toward him , when he had said that .
G@@ ide@@ on came to the Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men who were with him , fa@@ int , yet pursuing .
now Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ kor , and their armies with them , about fif@@ teen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
G@@ ide@@ on went up by the way of those who lived in ten@@ ts on the east of N@@ ob@@ ah and Jo@@ g@@ beha@@ h , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
he took the el@@ ders of the city , and thor@@ ns of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and bri@@ ers , and with them he ta@@ ught the men of Suc@@ co@@ th .
so Mi@@ dian was sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h of the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ ri@@ tes .
it happened , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the pro@@ stitute after the Ba@@ als , and made Ba@@ al Ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies on every side ;
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the e@@ ars of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hear@@ ts inc@@ lined to follow A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
he went to his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and killed his brothers the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being sev@@ enty persons , on one stone : but Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hi@@ d himself .
all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem assemb@@ led themselves together , and all the house of Mil@@ lo , and went and made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , by the o@@ ak of the pil@@ lar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood on the top of Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cri@@ ed , and said to them , " listen to me , you men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may listen to you .
" the v@@ ine said to them , ' Sho@@ uld I leave my new wine , which che@@ ers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , sev@@ enty persons , on one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his female ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ) ;
if you then have dealt truly and righ@@ te@@ ously with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and with his house this day , then re@@ jo@@ ice in A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and let him also re@@ jo@@ ice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and dev@@ our the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and the house of Mil@@ lo ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and from the house of Mil@@ lo , and dev@@ our A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch . "
Jo@@ th@@ am ran away , and fled , and went to Be@@ er , and lived there , for fear of A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch his brother .
God sent an ev@@ il spirit between A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch :
the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set an amb@@ ush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his brothers , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their trust in him .
they went out into the field , and har@@ v@@ ested their v@@ ine@@ yards , and tro@@ d the grap@@ es , and held festival , and went into the house of their go@@ d , and ate and d@@ rank , and Cur@@ sed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch craf@@ ti@@ ly , saying , " be@@ hold , G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his brothers have come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and be@@ hold , they inc@@ ite the city against you .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and be@@ hold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and be@@ hold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were there@@ in : and he beat down the city , and so@@ wed it with salt .
all the people likewise each cut down his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them at the base of the stron@@ gh@@ old , and set the stron@@ gh@@ old on fire on them ; so that all the people of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the ro@@ of of the to@@ wer .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
when the men of Israel saw that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch was dead , they depar@@ ted every man to his place .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and served the Ba@@ als , and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of S@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t serve him .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the children of Am@@ mon .
the children of Am@@ mon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was very dist@@ ressed .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to the children of Israel , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I save you from the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and from the Am@@ ori@@ tes , from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
then the children of Am@@ mon were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . the children of Israel assemb@@ led themselves together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
the people , the pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
now J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or , and he was the son of a pro@@ stitute : and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad became the father of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain fel@@ lows to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to get J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b ;
the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , " T@@ her@@ e@@ fore we have turned again to you now , that you may go with us , and fight with the children of Am@@ mon ; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to the Red Sea , and came to K@@ ade@@ sh ;
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , delivered S@@ ih@@ on and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they struck them : so Israel poss@@ essed all the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the inhabitants of that country .
while Israel lived in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and its towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Ar@@ non , three hundred years ; why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you rec@@ over them within that time ?
I therefore have not sin@@ ned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yah@@ we@@ h , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Am@@ mon . "
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , it shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering . "
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may de@@ part and go down on the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my compan@@ ions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she was a vir@@ gin . it was a cust@@ om in Israel ,
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were gathered together , and passed nor@@ th@@ ward ; and they said to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , " Wh@@ y did you pass over to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t call us to go with you ? we will bur@@ n your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dani@@ tes , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bear .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to the woman , and said to her , " Se@@ e now , you are bar@@ ren , and don '@@ t bear ; but you shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son .
for , be@@ hold , you shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son ; and no ra@@ zor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Naz@@ ir@@ ite to God from the w@@ om@@ b : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
then Man@@ o@@ ah ent@@ re@@ ated Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " O@@ h , Lord , ple@@ ase let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and te@@ ach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
God list@@ ened to the voice of Man@@ o@@ ah ; and the an@@ gel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Man@@ o@@ ah , her husband , was@@ n '@@ t with her .
the woman made has@@ te , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " be@@ hold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the v@@ ine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing ; all that I comman@@ ded her let her observe . "
Man@@ o@@ ah said to the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h , " P@@ le@@ ase , let us de@@ tain you , that we may make a young go@@ at ready for you . "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to Man@@ o@@ ah , " Th@@ ough you de@@ tain me , I won '@@ t eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering , you must offer it to Yah@@ we@@ h . " for Man@@ o@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that he was the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Man@@ o@@ ah took the young go@@ at with the me@@ al offering , and offered it on the rock to Yah@@ we@@ h . then the an@@ gel did a won@@ der@@ ful thing as Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
for it happened , when the fla@@ me went up toward the sky from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar : and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
but the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t appear to Man@@ o@@ ah or to his wife any more . then Man@@ o@@ ah knew that he was the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
but his father and his mother di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that it was of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for he sought an occasion against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . now at that time the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had rule over Israel .
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ n@@ ah , and came to the v@@ ine@@ yards of Tim@@ n@@ ah : and be@@ hold , a young lion ro@@ ar@@ ed against him .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on him , and he t@@ ore him as he would have torn a young go@@ at ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell his father or his mother what he had done .
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the car@@ cas@@ s of the lion : and be@@ hold , there was a s@@ warm of be@@ es in the body of the lion , and hon@@ ey .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing gra@@ in of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks and the standing gra@@ in , and also the olive gro@@ ves .
he struck them hip and th@@ igh with a great sla@@ ughter : and he went down and lived in the cle@@ ft of the rock of E@@ tam .
they said to him , " We have come down to bin@@ d you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . " Sam@@ son said to them , " swe@@ ar to me that you will not fall on me yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
he found a fresh j@@ aw@@ bone of a don@@ key , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men there@@ with .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ram@@ ath Leh@@ i .
he was very thir@@ st@@ y , and called on Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " You have given this great deliver@@ ance by the hand of your ser@@ vant ; and now shall I die for thir@@ st , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ? "
Sam@@ son said to her , " If they bin@@ d me with seven green cor@@ ds that were never dri@@ ed , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
he said to her , " If they only bin@@ d me with new ro@@ pes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his sou@@ l was troubled to death .
she said , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are upon you , Sam@@ son ! " he aw@@ oke out of his sle@@ ep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that Yah@@ we@@ h had depar@@ ted from him .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to D@@ agon their go@@ d , and to re@@ jo@@ ice ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered our enemy and the destro@@ yer of our country , who has sla@@ in many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , " C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may enter@@ tain us . " they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pil@@ lars ;
and Sam@@ son said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pil@@ lars where@@ upon the house rests , that I may le@@ an on them . "
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were on the ro@@ of about three thousand men and women , who saw while Sam@@ son performed .
Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pil@@ lars on which the house rested , and le@@ an@@ ed on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an en@@ gra@@ ved image and a m@@ ol@@ ten image : and it was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
the man depar@@ ted out of the city , out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he trav@@ eled .
Mic@@ ah consec@@ rated the Lev@@ ite , and the young man became his pri@@ est , and was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes sought an inher@@ it@@ ance to d@@ well in ; for to that day , their inher@@ it@@ ance had not fallen to them among the tri@@ bes of Israel .
they said , " arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and be@@ hold , it is very good . do you stand still ? D@@ on '@@ t be slo@@ th@@ ful to go and to enter in to poss@@ ess the land .
there set forth from there of the family of the Dani@@ tes , out of Zor@@ ah and out of E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol , six hundred men gir@@ t with weapons of war .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Lev@@ ite , even to the house of Mic@@ ah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men gir@@ t with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Mic@@ ah 's house , and f@@ et@@ ched the en@@ gra@@ ved image , the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the m@@ ol@@ ten image , the pri@@ est said to them , " What are you doing ? "
the pri@@ est 's heart was glad , and he took the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the en@@ gra@@ ved image , and went in the mid@@ st of the people .
when they were a good way from the house of Mic@@ ah , the men who were in the houses near to Mic@@ ah 's house were gathered together , and over@@ took the children of Dan .
he said , " You have taken away my go@@ ds which I made , and the pri@@ est , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan said to him , " D@@ on '@@ t let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fel@@ lows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they took that which Mic@@ ah had made , and the pri@@ est whom he had , and came to La@@ ish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the s@@ word ; and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the en@@ gra@@ ved image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Mos@@ es , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
it happened in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Lev@@ ite living on the far@@ ther side of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , who took to him a conc@@ ub@@ ine out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h .
his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , the young la@@ dy 's father , re@@ tained him ; and he stayed with him three days : so they ate and drink , and lo@@ d@@ ged there .
it happened on the fourth day , that they ar@@ ose early in the morning , and he rose up to de@@ part : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to his son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Str@@ eng@@ then your heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and d@@ rank , both of them together : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to the man , " P@@ le@@ ase be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
but the man wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stay that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus ( the same is Jer@@ usalem ) : and there were with him a couple of don@@ ke@@ ys s@@ add@@ led ; his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said to his master , " P@@ le@@ ase come and let us turn aside into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it . "
his master said to him , " We won '@@ t turn aside into the city of a foreig@@ ner , that is not of the children of Israel ; but we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gi@@ be@@ ah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lo@@ dge .
be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " W@@ here are you going ? where did you come from ? "
yet there is both stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for our don@@ ke@@ ys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your hand@@ ma@@ id , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
then came the woman in the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lor@@ d was , until it was light .
her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " G@@ et up , and let us be going ! " but no one answ@@ ered . then he took her up on the don@@ key ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
when he had come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , lim@@ b by lim@@ b , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation was assemb@@ led as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , with the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to Yah@@ we@@ h at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot@@ men who drew s@@ word .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah . ) The children of Israel said , " T@@ ell us , how did this w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess happen ? "
the Lev@@ ite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answ@@ ered , " I came into Gi@@ be@@ ah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my conc@@ ub@@ ine , to lo@@ dge .
the men of Gi@@ be@@ ah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have sla@@ in me , and they forced my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and she is dead .
I took my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inher@@ it@@ ance of Israel ; for they have committed le@@ w@@ d@@ ness and Fol@@ ly in Israel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gi@@ be@@ ah : we will go up against it by lot ;
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fel@@ lows , who are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
the children of Israel ar@@ ose , and went up to Be@@ the@@ l , and asked coun@@ sel of God ; and they said , " Wh@@ o shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? " Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Ju@@ da@@ h first . "
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gi@@ be@@ ah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes on that day twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men ; all these drew the s@@ word .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came to Be@@ the@@ l , and we@@ pt , and sat there before Yah@@ we@@ h , and fas@@ ted that day until evening ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
there came over against Gi@@ be@@ ah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that ev@@ il was close on them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they tr@@ usted the amb@@ ush@@ ers whom they had set against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the amb@@ ush@@ ers hur@@ ried , and rushed on Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the amb@@ ush@@ ers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the amb@@ ush@@ ers was that they should make a great cl@@ oud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cl@@ oud began to arise up out of the city in a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them ; and be@@ hold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dis@@ may@@ ed ; for they saw that ev@@ il had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its mid@@ st .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to the rock of R@@ im@@ mon , and stayed in the rock of R@@ im@@ mon four months .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , both the entire city , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
now the men of Israel had sworn in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of R@@ im@@ mon , and proclaimed peace to them .
they said , " There must be an inher@@ it@@ ance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tri@@ be not be blo@@ t@@ ted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wi@@ ves of our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cur@@ sed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they said , " be@@ hold , there is a feast of Yah@@ we@@ h from year to year in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is on the north of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of L@@ eb@@ on@@ ah . "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of those who dan@@ ced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inher@@ it@@ ance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel depar@@ ted there at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that Yah@@ we@@ h had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
Na@@ om@@ i said to her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " G@@ o , return each of you to her mother 's house : Yah@@ we@@ h deal kin@@ dly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
Yah@@ we@@ h grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she k@@ is@@ sed them , and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
go back , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband ton@@ ight , and should also bear sons ;
so they two went until they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . it happened , when they had come to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Na@@ om@@ i ? "
so Na@@ om@@ i returned , and R@@ ut@@ h the Mo@@ abi@@ tes@@ s , her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : and they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem in the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
she went , and came and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Bo@@ az , who was of the family of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
be@@ hold , Bo@@ az came from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said to the re@@ apers , " Yah@@ we@@ h be with you . " they answ@@ ered him , " Yah@@ we@@ h b@@ less you . "
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said to him , " Wh@@ y have I found fav@@ or in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreig@@ ner ? "
May Yah@@ we@@ h repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , under whose w@@ ings you have come to take ref@@ uge . "
then she said , " Let me find fav@@ or in your sight , my lor@@ d , because you have comfor@@ ted me , and because you have spoken kin@@ dly to your hand@@ ma@@ id , though I am not as one of your hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
Na@@ om@@ i said to R@@ ut@@ h her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his ma@@ i@@ den@@ s , and that they not meet you in any other field . "
so she stayed close to the ma@@ i@@ den@@ s of Bo@@ az , to g@@ le@@ an to the end of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est and of wheat har@@ v@@ est ; and she lived with her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
therefore was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ self , ano@@ int yo@@ ur@@ self , get d@@ ressed , and go down to the th@@ res@@ hing floor , but don '@@ t make yo@@ ur@@ self known to the man until he has finished e@@ ating and drinking .
she went down to the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and did according to all that her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law told her .
now , my daughter , don '@@ t be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a wor@@ thy woman .
he said to the near k@@ ins@@ man , " Na@@ om@@ i , who has come back out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , is selling the par@@ cel of land , which was our brother Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's .
Bo@@ az said to the el@@ ders , and to all the people , " You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's , and all that was Ch@@ il@@ ion 's and Mah@@ lon 's , from the hand of Na@@ om@@ i .
he shall be to you a re@@ sto@@ rer of life , and sustain you in your old age , for your daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , who lov@@ es you , who is better to you than seven sons , has bor@@ ne him . "
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim Z@@ op@@ him , of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of To@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite :
and he had two wi@@ ves ; the name of the one was H@@ ann@@ ah , and the name of other Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah : and Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah had children , but H@@ ann@@ ah had no children .
when the day came that El@@ kan@@ ah sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed , he gave to Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah his wife , and to all her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , por@@ tions :
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t eat .
so H@@ ann@@ ah rose up after they had e@@ aten in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and after they had dr@@ un@@ k . now E@@ li the pri@@ est was sitting on his seat by the do@@ or@@ post of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le .
she said , " Let your hand@@ ma@@ id find fav@@ or in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her fac@@ ial expression was@@ n '@@ t sad any more .
they rose up in the morning early , and wor@@ shi@@ ped before Yah@@ we@@ h , and returned , and came to their house to Ram@@ ah : and El@@ kan@@ ah knew H@@ ann@@ ah his wife ; and Yah@@ we@@ h remember@@ ed her .
it happened , when the time had come , that H@@ ann@@ ah conce@@ ived , and b@@ ore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Bec@@ ause I have asked him of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
but H@@ ann@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is we@@ an@@ ed ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yah@@ we@@ h , and stay there fore@@ ver . "
when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ ls , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h . the child was young .
" talk no more so exceeding pro@@ u@@ dly . D@@ on '@@ t let ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance come out of your m@@ outh , For Yah@@ we@@ h is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hun@@ gry are satisfied . yes , the bar@@ ren has bor@@ ne seven . she who has many children langu@@ is@@ hes .
he will keep the feet of his hol@@ y ones , but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put to sil@@ ence in d@@ ark@@ ness ; for no man shall prev@@ ail by strength .
those who strive with Yah@@ we@@ h shall be broken to pieces . he will Th@@ under against them in the sky . " Yah@@ we@@ h will judge the ends of the ear@@ th . he will give strength to his king , and ex@@ alt the Hor@@ n of his ano@@ in@@ ted . "
and he struck it into the pan , or ket@@ tle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or po@@ t ; all that the for@@ k brought up the pri@@ est took there@@ with . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h to all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who came there .
moreover his mother made him a little ro@@ be , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the ye@@ arly sacrifice .
now E@@ li was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
a man of God came to E@@ li , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bon@@ da@@ ge to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ?
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the aff@@ li@@ ction of my habi@@ tation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house fore@@ ver .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ in@@ ted fore@@ ver .
it happened at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
and the lam@@ p of God h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t yet gone out , and Samuel had laid down in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , where the Ar@@ k of God was ;
therefore E@@ li said to Samuel , " G@@ o , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Spe@@ ak , Yah@@ we@@ h ; for your ser@@ vant he@@ ars . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " be@@ hold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the e@@ ars of everyone who he@@ ars it shall t@@ ing@@ le .
in that day I will perform against E@@ li all that I have spoken concerning his house , from the beginning even to the end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house fore@@ ver , for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity which he knew , because his sons brought a cur@@ se on themselves , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t re@@ strain them .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
so the people sent to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h ; and they brought from there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who s@@ its above the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m : and the two sons of E@@ li , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , were there with the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out , they said , " What does the no@@ ise of this great sh@@ out in the camp of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws mean ? " they understood that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h had come into the camp .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Wo@@ e to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Wo@@ e to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these m@@ igh@@ ty go@@ ds ? these are the go@@ ds that struck the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans with all kinds of plagu@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great sla@@ ughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot@@ men .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h the same day , with his clo@@ th@@ es torn , and with ear@@ th on his head .
he who brought the news answ@@ ered , " Israel has fled before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and there has been also a great sla@@ ughter among the people . your two sons also , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , are dead , and the Ar@@ k of God has been captured . "
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer , neither did she regard it .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took the Ar@@ k of God , and brought it into the house of D@@ agon , and set it by D@@ agon .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the next day , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the pri@@ ests of D@@ agon , nor any who come into D@@ agon 's house , tre@@ ad on the threshold of D@@ agon in Ash@@ do@@ d , to this day .
when the men of Ash@@ do@@ d saw that it was so , they said , " The Ar@@ k of the God of Israel shall not stay with us ; for his hand is severe on us , and on D@@ agon our go@@ d . "
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against the city with a very great conf@@ usion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and t@@ um@@ ors broke out on them .
the men who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t die were struck with the t@@ um@@ ors ; and the cry of the city went up to heav@@ en .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the pri@@ ests and the di@@ vin@@ ers , saying , " What shall we do with the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
therefore you shall make images of your t@@ um@@ ors , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and you shall give gl@@ ory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
why then do you har@@ den your hear@@ ts , as the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h har@@ dened their hear@@ ts ? when he had worked won@@ der@@ fully among them , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t they let the people go , and they depar@@ ted ?
" now therefore take and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves a new c@@ art , and two milk co@@ ws , on which there has come no yok@@ e ; and tie the co@@ ws to the c@@ art , and bring their cal@@ ves home from them ;
and they put the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h on the c@@ art , and the co@@ ffer with the m@@ ice of gold and the images of their t@@ um@@ ors .
the co@@ ws took the stra@@ ight way by the way to Beth She@@ mes@@ h ; they went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them to the border of Beth She@@ mes@@ h .
they of Beth She@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the c@@ art , and offered up the co@@ ws for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , in which the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth She@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day to Yah@@ we@@ h .
these are the golden t@@ um@@ ors which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering to Yah@@ we@@ h : for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
the men of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened , from the day that the Ar@@ k stayed in Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamen@@ ted after Yah@@ we@@ h .
they gathered together to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and drew water , and p@@ oured it out before Yah@@ we@@ h , and fas@@ ted on that day , and said there , " We have sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h . " Samuel jud@@ ged the children of Israel in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " D@@ on '@@ t ce@@ ase to cry to Yah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
as Samuel was offering up the bur@@ n@@ t offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ under@@ ed with a great Th@@ under on that day on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and conf@@ used them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and struck them , until they came under Beth K@@ ar .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were sub@@ du@@ ed , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from E@@ kr@@ on even to G@@ ath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . there was peace between Israel and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and they shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots ;
he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your olive gro@@ ves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your se@@ ed , and of your v@@ ine@@ yards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your don@@ ke@@ ys , and put them to his work .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , the son of a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or .
he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant who was with him , " C@@ ome , and let us return , lest my father stop car@@ ing about the don@@ ke@@ ys , and be anx@@ ious for us . "
the ser@@ vant answ@@ ered Sa@@ ul again , and said , " be@@ hold , I have in my hand the fourth part of a sh@@ ek@@ el of silver . I will give that to the man of God , to tell us our way . "
( in earlier times in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he said , " C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er " ; for he who is now called a pro@@ phe@@ t was before called a Se@@ er . )
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
as for your don@@ ke@@ ys who were lost three days ago , don '@@ t set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desi@@ ra@@ ble in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
Samuel took Sa@@ ul and his ser@@ vant , and brought them into the guest room , and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited , who were about thirty persons .
they ar@@ ose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Sa@@ ul on the hous@@ et@@ op , saying , " G@@ et up , that I may send you away . " Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took the vi@@ al of oil , and p@@ oured it on his head , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and said , " Is@@ n '@@ t it that Yah@@ we@@ h has ano@@ in@@ ted you to be pr@@ ince over his inher@@ it@@ ance ?
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , be@@ hold , he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied with the pro@@ ph@@ ets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of K@@ ish ? is Sa@@ ul also among the pro@@ ph@@ ets ? "
Sa@@ ul said to his un@@ cle , " He told us pla@@ in@@ ly that the don@@ ke@@ ys were found . " but concerning the matter of the k@@ ing@@ dom , of which Samuel spoke , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell him .
he brought the tri@@ be of Benjamin near by their families ; and the family of the Mat@@ ri@@ tes was taken ; and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish was taken : but when they sought him , he could not be found .
they ran and f@@ et@@ ched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the mes@@ sen@@ gers came to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and spoke these words in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
they said to the mes@@ sen@@ gers who came , " Th@@ us you shall tell the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , ' Tom@@ orrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have deliver@@ ance . ' " the mes@@ sen@@ gers came and told the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h ; and they were glad .
now , be@@ hold , the king walk@@ s before you ; and I am old and gra@@ y @@@ -@@ @ headed ; and be@@ hold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yah@@ we@@ h who appointed Mos@@ es and Aaron , and that brought your fa@@ thers up out of the land of Egypt .
" when Jac@@ o@@ b had come into Egypt , and your fa@@ thers cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , then Yah@@ we@@ h sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , who brought your fa@@ thers out of Egypt , and made them to d@@ well in this place .
" but they for@@ got Yah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b ; and they fought against them .
they cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , ' We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , and have served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enem@@ ies , and we will serve you . '
" when you saw that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yah@@ we@@ h your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yah@@ we@@ h , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , then both you and also the king who re@@ ig@@ ns over you are followers of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , then will the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yah@@ we@@ h to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yah@@ we@@ h in ce@@ asing to pra@@ y for you : but I will instruc@@ t you in the good and the right way .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines assemb@@ led themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ se@@ men , and people as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore in multi@@ tude : and they came up , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , eas@@ tw@@ ard of Beth Av@@ en .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it ( for the people were dist@@ ressed ) , then the people hi@@ d themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in cover@@ ts , and in p@@ its .
now some of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws had gone over the Jordan to the land of G@@ ad and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; but as for Sa@@ ul , he was yet in G@@ ilg@@ al , and all the people followed him tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might gre@@ et him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down on me to G@@ ilg@@ al , and I ha@@ ven '@@ t ent@@ re@@ ated the fav@@ or of Yah@@ we@@ h . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the bur@@ n@@ t offering . "
but now your k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue . Yah@@ we@@ h has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed him to be pr@@ ince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded you . "
Sa@@ ul , and Jon@@ athan his son , and the people who were present with them , stayed in Ge@@ ba of Benjamin : but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ camp@@ ed in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , to the land of Sh@@ ual ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said to the young man who b@@ ore his arm@@ or , " C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . " but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell his father .
and A@@ hij@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , I@@ cha@@ bo@@ d 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of E@@ li , the pri@@ est of Yah@@ we@@ h in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . the people di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that Jon@@ athan was gone .
between the passes , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the one side , and a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
the one c@@ rag rose up on the north in front of Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , and the other on the south in front of Ge@@ ba .
both of them revealed themselves to the gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , " be@@ hold , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws are coming out of the ho@@ les where they had hidden themselves ! "
that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a fur@@ row 's length in an ac@@ re of land .
it happened , while Sa@@ ul talked to the pri@@ est , that the t@@ um@@ ult that was in the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Sa@@ ul said to the pri@@ est , " With@@ draw your hand ! "
Sa@@ ul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow : a very great conf@@ usion .
now the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jon@@ athan di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear when his father comman@@ ded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d who was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
and the people fle@@ w on the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and c@@ attle , and cal@@ ves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now when Sa@@ ul had taken the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , he fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and wher@@ ever he turned himself , he defeated them .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua ; and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az . the name of the captain of his army was Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
there was severe war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Sa@@ ul : and when Sa@@ ul saw any m@@ igh@@ ty man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him to him .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' I have marked that which A@@ mal@@ ek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
" it gri@@ ev@@ es me that I have set up Sa@@ ul to be king ; for he is turned back from following me , and has not performed my comman@@ d@@ ments . " Samuel was angry ; and he cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h all night .
Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and be@@ hold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to G@@ ilg@@ al . "
Samuel said to him , " Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neigh@@ bor of yo@@ urs who is better than you .
Samuel said , " As your s@@ word has made women ch@@ ild@@ less , so your mother will be ch@@ ild@@ less among women ! " Samuel cut A@@ ga@@ g in pieces before Yah@@ we@@ h in G@@ ilg@@ al .
then Samuel took the Hor@@ n of oil , and ano@@ in@@ ted him in the mid@@ st of his brothers : and the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
Sa@@ ul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , and set the battle in array against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a val@@ ley between them .
he had a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he was cla@@ d with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul , stric@@ ken among men .
the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se had gone after Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
now Sa@@ ul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , fighting with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
David left his bag@@ g@@ age in the hand of the keep@@ er of the bag@@ g@@ age , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were ter@@ ri@@ fied .
Sa@@ ul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said , " Yah@@ we@@ h who delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . " Sa@@ ul said to David , " G@@ o ; and Yah@@ we@@ h shall be with you . "
Sa@@ ul d@@ ressed David with his clo@@ thing . he put a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he cla@@ d him with a co@@ at of mail .
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in his wal@@ let . his s@@ ling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he dis@@ da@@ ined him ; for he was but a youth , and ru@@ d@@ dy , and with@@ al of a fair face .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said to David , " C@@ ome to me , and I will give your f@@ les@@ h to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the field . "
and that all this assembly may know that Yah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t save with s@@ word and spe@@ ar : for the battle is Yah@@ we@@ h 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine ar@@ ose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hur@@ ried , and ran toward the army to meet the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and s@@ lun@@ g it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head ; and the stone san@@ k into his fore@@ head , and he fell on his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of its she@@ ath , and killed him , and cut off his head there@@ with . when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ar@@ ose , and sh@@ ou@@ ted , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , until you come to G@@ ai , and to the gates of E@@ kr@@ on . the wounded of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fell down by the way to Sha@@ ar@@ aim , even to G@@ ath , and to E@@ kr@@ on .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clo@@ thing , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his s@@ ash .
it happened on the next day , that an ev@@ il spirit from God came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on Sa@@ ul , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the mid@@ st of the house . David played with his hand , as he did day by day . Sa@@ ul had his spe@@ ar in his hand ;
David said to Sa@@ ul , " Wh@@ o am I , and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to the king ? "
Sa@@ ul comman@@ ded his servants , " talk with David secre@@ tly , and say , ' be@@ hold , the king has de@@ light in you , and all his servants love you : now therefore be the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . ' "
Sa@@ ul 's servants spoke those words in the e@@ ars of David . David said , " Do@@ es it seems to you a light thing to be the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , since I am a poor man , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed ? "
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . the days were not expired ;
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it happened , as often as they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was highly es@@ te@@ emed .
I will go out and stand bes@@ ide my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Sa@@ ul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spe@@ ar ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he st@@ uck the spe@@ ar into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Sa@@ ul sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Mic@@ hal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don '@@ t save your life ton@@ ight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
Mic@@ hal took the ter@@ ap@@ him , and laid it in the bed , and put a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir at its head , and covered it with the clo@@ th@@ es .
when the mes@@ sen@@ gers came in , be@@ hold , the ter@@ ap@@ him was in the bed , with the pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir at its head .
he went there to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah . then the Spiri@@ t of God came on him also , and he went on , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , until he came to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
David said to Jon@@ athan , " be@@ hold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
if your father mis@@ s me at all , then say , ' David ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly asked leave of me that he might run to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem his city ; for it is the ye@@ arly sacrifice there for all the family . '
therefore deal kin@@ dly with your ser@@ vant ; for you have brought your ser@@ vant into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h with you : but if there is in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in me , kill me yo@@ ur@@ self ; for why should you bring me to your father ? "
but also you shall not cut off your kin@@ d@@ ness from my house fore@@ ver ; no , not when Yah@@ we@@ h has cut off the enem@@ ies of David everyone from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th . "
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hi@@ d yo@@ ur@@ self when this started , and shall remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jon@@ athan stood up , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of J@@ es@@ se lives on the ear@@ th , you shall not be established , nor your k@@ ing@@ dom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall su@@ rely die ! "
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
it happened in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
when the boy had come to the place of the ar@@ row which Jon@@ athan had shot , Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the boy , and said , " Is@@ n '@@ t the ar@@ row beyond you ? "
Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the boy , " G@@ o fast ! hur@@ ry ! D@@ on '@@ t delay ! " Jon@@ athan 's boy gathered up the ar@@ ro@@ ws , and came to his master .
as soon as the boy was gone , David ar@@ ose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bo@@ wed himself three times . they k@@ is@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , and David we@@ pt the most .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g the E@@ dom@@ ite , the best of the her@@ d@@ s@@ men who belonged to Sa@@ ul .
David ar@@ ose , and fled that day for fear of Sa@@ ul , and went to A@@ ch@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
the servants of A@@ ch@@ ish said to him , " Is@@ n '@@ t this David the king of the land ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t they sing one to another about him in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
David therefore depar@@ ted there , and escaped to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in dist@@ ress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was dis@@ conten@@ ted , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Sa@@ ul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Sa@@ ul was sitting in Gi@@ be@@ ah , under the tam@@ ar@@ is@@ k tree in Ram@@ ah , with his spe@@ ar in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
Sa@@ ul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Benj@@ am@@ ites ! will the son of J@@ es@@ se give everyone of you fields and v@@ ine@@ yards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
then the king sent to call A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the pri@@ est , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and all his father 's house , the pri@@ ests who were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
he struck No@@ b , the city of the pri@@ ests , with the edge of the s@@ word , both men and women , children and nur@@ sing ba@@ bies , and c@@ attle and don@@ ke@@ ys and she@@ ep , with the edge of the s@@ word .
David and his men went to Ke@@ il@@ ah , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brought away their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and killed them with a great sla@@ ughter . so David sav@@ ed the inhabitants of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
it happened , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , ar@@ ose and depar@@ ted out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went wher@@ ever they could go . it was told Sa@@ ul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he gave up going there .
David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , and remained in the hill country in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h . Sa@@ ul sought him every day , but God di@@ d@@ n '@@ t deliver him into his hand .
he said to him , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for the hand of Sa@@ ul my father shall not find you ; and you shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you ; and that also Sa@@ ul my father knows . "
then the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes came up to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , " Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t David hide himself with us in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of the de@@ sert ?
now therefore , O king , come down , according to all the desire of your sou@@ l to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king 's hand . "
they ar@@ ose , and went to Z@@ ip@@ h before Sa@@ ul : but David and his men were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on , in the Ara@@ bah on the south of the de@@ sert .
Sa@@ ul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
Sa@@ ul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made has@@ te to get away for fear of Sa@@ ul ; for Sa@@ ul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them .
it happened , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , " be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En Ge@@ di . "
he came to the she@@ ep pen@@ s by the way , where there was a cave ; and Sa@@ ul went in to reli@@ eve himself . now David and his men were abi@@ ding in the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the cave .
so David checked his men with these words , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow them to rise against Sa@@ ul . Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also ar@@ ose after@@ ward , and went out of the cave , and cri@@ ed after Sa@@ ul , saying , " My lor@@ d the king ! " when Sa@@ ul looked behind him , David bo@@ wed with his face to the ear@@ th , and showed respect .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yah@@ we@@ h had delivered me up into your hand , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away un@@ har@@ med ? therefore may Yah@@ we@@ h reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
swe@@ ar now therefore to me by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " G@@ o up to Car@@ mel , and go to Nab@@ al , and gre@@ et him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' L@@ ong life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
now I have heard that you have s@@ hear@@ ers . your she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds have now been with us , and we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hurt them , neither was there anything missing from them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
ask your young men , and they will tell you . therefore let the young men find fav@@ or in your eyes ; for we come in a good day . ple@@ ase give whatever comes to your hand , to your servants , and to your son David . ' "
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nab@@ al according to all those words in the name of David , and ce@@ ased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it to men who I don '@@ t know where they come from ? "
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
but the men were very good to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we anything , as long as we went with them , when we were in the fields .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the she@@ ep .
it was so , as she ro@@ de on her don@@ key , and came down by the cover@@ t of the mountain , that be@@ hold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
God do so to the enem@@ ies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who ur@@ in@@ ates on a wall . "
when A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il saw David , she hur@@ ried , and al@@ igh@@ ted from her don@@ key , and fell before David on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground .
now this present which your ser@@ vant has brought to my lor@@ d , let it be given to the young men who follow my lor@@ d .
ple@@ ase for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of your hand@@ ma@@ id . for Yah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house , because my lor@@ d fights the batt@@ les of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and ev@@ il shall not be found in you all your days .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your sou@@ l , yet the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with Yah@@ we@@ h your God . he will s@@ ling out the so@@ ul@@ s of your enem@@ ies , as from the hol@@ low of a s@@ ling .
it shall come to pass , when Yah@@ we@@ h has done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you pr@@ ince over Israel ,
that this shall be no gri@@ ef to you , nor offen@@ se of heart to my lor@@ d , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lor@@ d has av@@ en@@ ged himself . when Yah@@ we@@ h has dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember your hand@@ ma@@ id . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " G@@ o up in peace to your house . be@@ hold , I have list@@ ened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il to Car@@ mel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she ar@@ ose , and bo@@ wed her@@ self with her face to the ear@@ th , and said , " be@@ hold , your hand@@ ma@@ id is a ser@@ vant to was@@ h the feet of the servants of my lor@@ d . "
A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il hur@@ ried , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de on a don@@ key , with five ladi@@ es of hers who followed her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
Sa@@ ul en@@ camp@@ ed in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before the de@@ sert , by the way . but David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had en@@ camp@@ ed ; and David saw the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his army : and Sa@@ ul lay within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , and the people were en@@ camp@@ ed around him .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul lay sle@@ eping within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , with his spe@@ ar st@@ uck in the ground at his head ; and Ab@@ ner and the people lay around him .
Yah@@ we@@ h for@@ bid that I should put forth my hand against Yah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ in@@ ted ; but now ple@@ ase take the spe@@ ar that is at his head , and the j@@ ar of water , and let us go . "
he said , " Wh@@ y does my lor@@ d pursue after his ser@@ vant ? for what have I done ? or what ev@@ il is in my hand ?
now therefore , don '@@ t let my blood fall to the ear@@ th away from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one hun@@ ts a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains . "
be@@ hold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and let him deliver me out of all op@@ pression . "
David ar@@ ose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to A@@ ch@@ ish the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
David lived with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and sav@@ ed neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the c@@ attle , and the don@@ ke@@ ys , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the clo@@ thing ; and he returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
it happened in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . A@@ ch@@ ish said to David , " K@@ now assu@@ red@@ ly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . Sa@@ ul had put away those who had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
the woman said to him , " be@@ hold , you know what Sa@@ ul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land . why then do you lay a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ? "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice ; and the woman spoke to Sa@@ ul , saying , " Wh@@ y have you dec@@ e@@ ived me ? for you are Sa@@ ul ! "
Yah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom out of your hand , and given it to your neigh@@ bor , even to David .
because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t exec@@ ute his fierce wr@@ ath on A@@ mal@@ ek , therefore Yah@@ we@@ h has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Yah@@ we@@ h will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yah@@ we@@ h will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
then Sa@@ ul fell immediately his full length on the ear@@ th , and was ter@@ ri@@ fied , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman came to Sa@@ ul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " be@@ hold , your hand@@ ma@@ id has list@@ ened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have list@@ ened to your words which you spoke to me .
now therefore , ple@@ ase listen also to the voice of your hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , con@@ strained him ; and he list@@ ened to their voice . so he ar@@ ose from the ear@@ th , and sat on the bed .
the woman had a f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f in the house . she hur@@ ried and killed it ; and she took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of it .
the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands ; and David and his men passed on in the re@@ ar with A@@ ch@@ ish .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lor@@ d who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to de@@ part in the morning , to return into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to J@@ ez@@ reel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had made a raid on the South , and on Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and had struck Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken cap@@ tive the women and all who were there@@ in , both small and great . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins@@ . when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
we made a raid on the South of the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and on that which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h , and on the South of Cal@@ e@@ b ; and we burned Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g with fire . "
David struck them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who ro@@ de on ca@@ me@@ ls and fled .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tar@@ ries by the bag@@ g@@ age : they shall share alike . "
when David came to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , he sent of the sp@@ oil to the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to his friends , saying , " be@@ hold , a present for you of the sp@@ oil of the enem@@ ies of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
and to those who were in R@@ ac@@ al , and to those who were in the cities of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and to those who were in the cities of the Ken@@ ites ,
and to those who were in Hor@@ ma@@ h , and to those who were in Bor@@ ash@@ an , and to those who were in Ath@@ ach ,
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard on Sa@@ ul and on his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his three sons fallen on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
they cut off his head , and stri@@ pped off his arm@@ or , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their id@@ ols , and to the people .
they put his arm@@ or in the house of the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th ; and they fas@@ tened his body to the wall of Beth S@@ han .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth S@@ han ; and they came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
it happened after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had stayed two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
it happened on the third day , that be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul , with his clo@@ th@@ es torn , and ear@@ th on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and showed respect .
David said to him , " Ho@@ w did it go ? ple@@ ase tell me . " he answ@@ ered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul was le@@ an@@ ing on his spe@@ ar ; and be@@ hold , the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men followed hard after him .
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until evening , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( and he comman@@ ded them to te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the song of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ har ) :
from the blood of the sla@@ in , from the f@@ at of the m@@ igh@@ ty , Jon@@ athan 's bo@@ w di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn back . Sa@@ ul 's s@@ word di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return empty .
Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan were lov@@ ely and pleas@@ ant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les . they were stronger than li@@ ons .
I am dist@@ ressed for you , my brother Jon@@ athan . you have been very pleas@@ ant to me . your love to me was won@@ der@@ ful , passing the love of women .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . they told David , saying , " The men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad were those who buried Sa@@ ul . "
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " b@@ les@@ sed are you by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kin@@ d@@ ness to your lor@@ d , even to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be val@@ i@@ ant ; for Sa@@ ul your lor@@ d is dead , and also the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have ano@@ in@@ ted me king over them . "
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h Haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
the battle was very severe that day : and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
Ab@@ ner said to him , " Tur@@ n aside to your right hand or to your left , and gra@@ b one of the young men , and take his arm@@ or . " but A@@ sah@@ el would not turn aside from following him .
but Jo@@ a@@ b and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that lies before Gi@@ ah by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
Jo@@ a@@ b said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , su@@ rely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Ab@@ ner and his men went all that night through the Ara@@ bah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ th@@ ron , and came to Mah@@ an@@ aim .
they took up A@@ sah@@ el , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . Jo@@ a@@ b and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at He@@ br@@ on .
now there was long war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Sa@@ ul grew we@@ aker and we@@ aker .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and the fourth , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ; and the fifth , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of A@@ bi@@ tal ;
it happened , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong in the house of Sa@@ ul .
her husband went with her , we@@ eping as he went , and followed her to Ba@@ hur@@ im . then Ab@@ ner said to him , " G@@ o ! return ! " and he returned .
now then do it ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my ser@@ vant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies . ' "
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
be@@ hold , the servants of David and Jo@@ a@@ b came from a for@@ ay , and brought in a great sp@@ oil with them : but Ab@@ ner was not with David in He@@ br@@ on ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Jo@@ a@@ b and all the army who was with him had come , they told Jo@@ a@@ b , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Jo@@ a@@ b came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? be@@ hold , Ab@@ ner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
you know Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to dec@@ e@@ ive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into f@@ et@@ ters . as a man falls before the children of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , so you fell . " all the people we@@ pt again over him .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er .
the sons of R@@ im@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ ha@@ b and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of I@@ sh@@ bos@@ het@@ h , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when w@@ ic@@ ked men have sla@@ in a righ@@ te@@ ous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the ear@@ th ? "
in times past , when Sa@@ ul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h said to you , ' You shall be she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of my people Israel , and you shall be pr@@ ince over Israel . ' "
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stron@@ gh@@ old .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall stir yo@@ ur@@ self up ; for then Yah@@ we@@ h has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
they set the Ar@@ k of God on a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b that was in the hill : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hi@@ o , the sons of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , dro@@ ve the new c@@ art .
when they came to the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Nac@@ on , Uz@@ z@@ ah reached for the Ar@@ k of God , and took hold of it ; for the c@@ attle stumb@@ led .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ z@@ ah ; and God struck him there for his er@@ ror ; and there he died by the Ar@@ k of God .
so David would not move the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
it was so , that , when those who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h had gone six p@@ aces , he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed an o@@ x and a f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f .
it was so , as the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
he gave to all the people , even among the whole multi@@ tude of Israel , both to men and women , to everyone a portion of bread , dates , and ra@@ is@@ ins . so all the people depar@@ ted everyone to his house .
I will be yet more v@@ ile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the hand@@ ma@@ ids of whom you have spoken , they shall hon@@ or me . "
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore you shall tell my ser@@ vant David this , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " I took you from the she@@ ep p@@ en , from following the she@@ ep , that you should be pr@@ ince over my people , over Israel .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you went , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sle@@ ep with your fa@@ thers , I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall proceed out of your bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he comm@@ its in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , I will ch@@ as@@ ten him with the ro@@ d of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men ;
but my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from him , as I took it from Sa@@ ul , whom I put away before you .
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this gre@@ at@@ ness , to make your ser@@ vant know it .
therefore you are great , Yah@@ we@@ h God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our e@@ ars .
for you , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your ser@@ vant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your ser@@ vant has found in his heart to pra@@ y this pray@@ er to you .
now therefore let it ple@@ ase you to b@@ less the house of your ser@@ vant , that it may continue fore@@ ver before you ; for you , Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it . let the house of your ser@@ vant be b@@ les@@ sed fore@@ ver with your b@@ les@@ sing . "
after this it happened that David struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sub@@ du@@ ed them : and David took the bri@@ dle of the mother city out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
he struck Mo@@ a@@ b , and meas@@ ured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he meas@@ ured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Mo@@ abi@@ tes became servants to David , and brought tri@@ bute .
when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David struck of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
then the king called to Z@@ ib@@ a , Sa@@ ul 's ser@@ vant , and said to him , " All that per@@ tained to Sa@@ ul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
then Z@@ ib@@ a said to the king , " Accor@@ ding to all that my lor@@ d the king comman@@ ds his ser@@ vant , so your shall ser@@ vant do . " so M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
it happened after this , that the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and Han@@ un his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
so Han@@ un took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their gar@@ ments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they were become odi@@ ous to David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syri@@ ans of Beth Re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah with one thousand men , and the men of To@@ b twelve thousand men .
the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and the men of To@@ b and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
he said , " If the Syri@@ ans are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be cour@@ age@@ ous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yah@@ we@@ h do that which seems good to him . "
so Jo@@ a@@ b and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syri@@ ans : and they fled before him .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
Had@@ ade@@ zer sent , and brought out the Syri@@ ans who were beyond the River : and they came to He@@ lam , with Sho@@ b@@ ach the captain of the army of Had@@ ade@@ zer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to He@@ lam . the Syri@@ ans set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
it happened at evening , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked on the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman ba@@ thing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was pur@@ ified from her un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess ) ; and she returned to her house .
when U@@ ri@@ ah had come to him , David asked of him how Jo@@ a@@ b did , and how the people far@@ ed , and how the war prosp@@ ered .
David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , " G@@ o down to your house , and was@@ h your feet . " U@@ ri@@ ah depar@@ ted out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but U@@ ri@@ ah sle@@ pt at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lor@@ d , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
when they had told David , saying , " U@@ ri@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house , " David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you come from a journey ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him dr@@ un@@ k . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lor@@ d , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
it happened , when Jo@@ a@@ b kept watch on the city , that he assigned U@@ ri@@ ah to the place where he knew that val@@ i@@ ant men were .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Jo@@ a@@ b . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te died also .
it shall be that , if the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he asks you , ' Wh@@ y did you go so near to the city to fight ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you know that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
the sho@@ o@@ ters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your ser@@ vant U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te is dead also . "
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wi@@ ves into your bos@@ om , and gave you the house of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
why have you desp@@ ised the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , to do that which is ev@@ il in his sight ? you have struck U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te with the s@@ word , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have sla@@ in him with the s@@ word of the children of Am@@ mon .
" this is what Yah@@ we@@ h says : ' be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wi@@ ves before your eyes , and give them to your neigh@@ bor , and he will lie with your wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
the el@@ ders of his house ar@@ ose bes@@ ide him , to raise him up from the ear@@ th : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
but when David saw that his servants were wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fas@@ ted and we@@ pt for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
he took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a tal@@ ent of gold , and in it were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
but Am@@ non had a friend , whose name was Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b , the son of Shi@@ me@@ ah , David 's brother ; and Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b was a very sub@@ tle man .
so Am@@ non lay down and fak@@ ed being si@@ ck . when the king came to see him , Am@@ non said to the king , " P@@ le@@ ase let my sister Tam@@ ar come , and make me a couple of cak@@ es in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . "
so Tam@@ ar went to her brother Am@@ non 's house ; and he was laid down . she took d@@ ough , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and made cak@@ es in his sight , and bak@@ ed the cak@@ es .
she took the pan , and p@@ oured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Am@@ non said , " H@@ ave all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Am@@ non said to Tam@@ ar , " Br@@ ing the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tam@@ ar took the cak@@ es which she had made , and brought them into the room to Am@@ non her brother .
she had a gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors on her ; for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who were vir@@ g@@ ins d@@ ressed . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and t@@ ore her gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , cr@@ ying al@@ oud as she went .
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man got up on his mul@@ e , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don '@@ t let my lor@@ d the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Am@@ non only is dead . "
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , many people were coming by way of the hil@@ l@@ side behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt . the king also and all his servants we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
your hand@@ ma@@ id had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his ser@@ vant . '
for the king will hear , to deliver his ser@@ vant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inher@@ it@@ ance of God .
then your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' P@@ le@@ ase let the word of my lor@@ d the king bring rest ; for as an an@@ gel of God , so is my lor@@ d the king to dis@@ cer@@ n good and bad . May Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , be with you . ' "
to change the face of the matter has your ser@@ vant Jo@@ a@@ b done this thing . my lor@@ d is wise , according to the wis@@ dom of an an@@ gel of God , to know all things that are in the ear@@ th . "
Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and b@@ les@@ sed the king . Jo@@ a@@ b said , " Today your ser@@ vant knows that I have found fav@@ or in your sight , my lor@@ d , king , in that the king has performed the request of his ser@@ vant . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
when he cut the ha@@ ir of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els , after the king 's weight .
to Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
so Jo@@ a@@ b came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bo@@ wed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king k@@ is@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obe@@ is@@ ance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
Ab@@ sal@@ om did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Ab@@ sal@@ om st@@ ole the hear@@ ts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of for@@ ty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said to the king , " P@@ le@@ ase let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed to Yah@@ we@@ h , in He@@ br@@ on .
two hundred men went with Ab@@ sal@@ om out of Jer@@ usalem , who were invited , and went in their simp@@ lic@@ ity ; and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know anything .
Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el the G@@ il@@ on@@ ite , David 's coun@@ sel@@ or , from his city , even from G@@ il@@ o@@ h , while he was offering the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . the con@@ spir@@ acy was strong ; for the people increased continu@@ ally with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
the king went forth , and all the people after him ; and they stayed in Beth Mer@@ hak .
all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men who came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
be@@ hold , Zad@@ ok also came , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God ; and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
but if he say thus , ' I have no de@@ light in you ; ' be@@ hold , here am I@@ . Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
David went up by the as@@ cent of the Mount of ol@@ ives , and we@@ pt as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was wor@@ shi@@ ped , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at torn , and ear@@ th on his head .
D@@ on '@@ t you have Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az , Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan , A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul came out , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a . he came out , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that Yah@@ we@@ h will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yah@@ we@@ h will repay me good for the cur@@ sing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shi@@ me@@ i went along on the hil@@ l@@ side opposite him , and Cur@@ sed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw d@@ ust .
it happened , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , had come to Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " L@@ ong live the king ! long live the king ! "
again , whom should I serve ? Sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
so they spread Ab@@ sal@@ om a tent on the top of the house ; and Ab@@ sal@@ om went in to his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines in the sight of all Israel .
the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , which he gave in those days , was as if a man inqu@@ ired at the or@@ acle of God : so was all the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el both with David and with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
I will come on him while he is we@@ ary and exha@@ usted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t ; for all Israel knows that your father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
but I coun@@ sel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , as the s@@ and that is by the sea for multi@@ tude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there is@@ n '@@ t one small stone found there . "
Ab@@ sal@@ om and all the men of Israel said , " The coun@@ sel of Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite is better than the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el . " for Yah@@ we@@ h had or@@ da@@ ined to defeat the good coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , to the intent that Yah@@ we@@ h might bring ev@@ il on Ab@@ sal@@ om .
then David ar@@ ose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there la@@ cked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his don@@ key , and ar@@ ose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and han@@ ged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
Ab@@ sal@@ om set A@@ masa over the army instead of Jo@@ a@@ b . now A@@ masa was the son of a man , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra the Isra@@ elite , who went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
Jo@@ a@@ b said to the man who told him , " be@@ hold , you saw it , and why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a s@@ ash . "
otherwise if I had dealt fal@@ sely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yo@@ ur@@ self would have set yo@@ ur@@ self against me . "
then Jo@@ a@@ b said , " I 'm not going to wait like this with you . " he took three dar@@ ts in his hand , and th@@ rust them through the heart of Ab@@ sal@@ om , while he was yet alive in the mid@@ st of the o@@ ak .
they took Ab@@ sal@@ om , and cast him into the great p@@ it in the forest , and raised over him a very great he@@ ap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , a man running alone .
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king gri@@ ev@@ es for his son . "
Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , " You have sha@@ med this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have sav@@ ed your life , and the lives of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of your wi@@ ves , and the lives of your conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
he bo@@ wed the heart of all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Ret@@ ur@@ n , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Ju@@ da@@ h came to G@@ ilg@@ al , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shi@@ me@@ i the son of Ger@@ a , the Benj@@ am@@ ite , who was of Ba@@ hur@@ im , hur@@ ried and came down with the men of Ju@@ da@@ h to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your ser@@ vant knows that I have sin@@ ned . therefore be@@ hold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king . "
M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul came down to meet the king ; and he had neither gro@@ o@@ med his feet , nor tri@@ m@@ med his be@@ ard , nor was@@ hed his clo@@ th@@ es , from the day the king depar@@ ted until the day he came home in peace .
it happened , when he had come to Jer@@ usalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you go with me , M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ? "
now Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even eigh@@ ty years old : and he had provided the king with sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Mah@@ an@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
the king answ@@ ered , " Ch@@ im@@ ham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you . whatever you require of me , that I will do for you . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king k@@ is@@ sed Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , and b@@ les@@ sed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to G@@ ilg@@ al , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went over with him . all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri ; but the men of Ju@@ da@@ h joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jer@@ usalem .
so A@@ masa went to call the men of Ju@@ da@@ h together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men ; and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Jo@@ a@@ b , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
he went through all the tri@@ bes of Israel to A@@ bel , and to Beth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall su@@ rely ask coun@@ sel at A@@ bel ; ' and so they settled it .
now Jo@@ a@@ b was over all the army of Israel ; and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and over the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites ;
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of Yah@@ we@@ h 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , whom she b@@ ore to Sa@@ ul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ; and the five sons of Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul , whom she b@@ ore to Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , and they han@@ ged them in the mountain before Yah@@ we@@ h , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of har@@ v@@ est , in the first days , at the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
and he brought up from there the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and the b@@ ones of Jon@@ athan his son : and they gathered the b@@ ones of those who were han@@ ged .
they buried the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son in the country of Benjamin in Z@@ ela , in the tomb of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . after that God was ent@@ re@@ ated for the land .
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ ai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite killed Sap@@ h , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b ; and El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are@@ o@@ regi@@ m the B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite killed Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te 's brother , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stat@@ ure , who had on every hand six fin@@ gers , and on every fo@@ ot six to@@ es , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
these four were born to the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yah@@ we@@ h the words of this song in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
God , my rock , in him I will take ref@@ uge ; my shield , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , my high to@@ wer , and my ref@@ uge . my Sav@@ ior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yah@@ we@@ h , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from my enem@@ ies .
in my dist@@ ress I called on Yah@@ we@@ h . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le . my cry came into his e@@ ars .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid b@@ are by the re@@ bu@@ ke of Yah@@ we@@ h , At the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
you will save the aff@@ lic@@ ted people , But your eyes are on the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , that you may bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h is tested . he is a shield to all those who take ref@@ uge in him .
I have consu@@ med them , and struck them through , so that they can '@@ t arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
you have also made my enem@@ ies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who h@@ ate me .
then I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th . I cr@@ us@@ hed them as the m@@ ire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enem@@ ies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
now these are the last words of David . David the son of J@@ es@@ se says , the man who was raised on high says , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , the swe@@ et p@@ sal@@ mist of Israel :
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righ@@ te@@ ously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds , when the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ ings out of the ear@@ th , through clear sh@@ ining after rain . '
but all of the un@@ go@@ dly shall be as thor@@ ns to be th@@ rust away , because they can '@@ t be taken with the hand ,
these are the names of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : Jos@@ he@@ b B@@ ass@@ he@@ bet@@ h a Tah@@ chem@@ on@@ ite , chief of the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite , against eight hundred sla@@ in at one time .
after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of len@@ ti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the three m@@ igh@@ ty men broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
W@@ as@@ n '@@ t he most hon@@ or@@ able of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t at@@ tain to the three .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a good@@ ly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and p@@ lu@@ cked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spe@@ ar .
the king said to Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army , who was with him , " Now go back and forth through all the tri@@ bes of Israel , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and number the people , that I may know the sum of the people . "
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the army . Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the stron@@ gh@@ old of T@@ y@@ re , and to all the cities of the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and they went out to the south of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jer@@ usalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men who drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
Ara@@ un@@ ah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Ara@@ un@@ ah said to David , " Let my lor@@ d the king take and offer up what seems good to him . be@@ hold , the c@@ attle for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the th@@ res@@ hing instruments and the yok@@ es of the ox@@ en for the wood :
now king David was old and stric@@ ken in years ; and they covered him with clo@@ th@@ es , but he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t keep warm .
therefore his servants said to him , " Let there be sought for my lor@@ d the king a young vir@@ gin . let her stand before the king , and ch@@ er@@ ish him ; and let her lie in your bos@@ om , that my lor@@ d the king may keep warm . "
then Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ex@@ al@@ ted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men who belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you , my lor@@ d , king , swe@@ ar to your hand@@ ma@@ id , saying , As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my th@@ r@@ one ? why then does Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah reign ? '
be@@ hold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
he has sla@@ in c@@ attle and fat@@ lings and she@@ ep in ab@@ und@@ ance , and has called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army ; but he has@@ n '@@ t called Solomon your ser@@ vant .
you , my lor@@ d the king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , that you should tell them who shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of my lor@@ d the king after him .
otherwise it will happen , when my lor@@ d the king shall sle@@ ep with his fa@@ thers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offen@@ ders . "
they told the king , saying , " be@@ hold , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t ! " when he had come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but he has@@ n '@@ t called me , even me your ser@@ vant , and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and your ser@@ vant Solomon .
most certainly as I s@@ wor@@ e to you by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , ' As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my th@@ r@@ one in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
the king said to them , " T@@ ake with you the servants of your lor@@ d , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mul@@ e , and bring him down to G@@ ih@@ on .
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my th@@ r@@ one ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be pr@@ ince over Israel and over Ju@@ da@@ h . "
so Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mul@@ e , and brought him to G@@ ih@@ on .
all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th sho@@ ok with their sound .
the king has sent with him Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mul@@ e .
moreover the king 's servants came to b@@ less our lor@@ d king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his th@@ r@@ one greater than your th@@ r@@ one ; ' and the king bo@@ wed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my th@@ r@@ one this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah fear@@ ed because of Solomon ; and he ar@@ ose , and went , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he comman@@ ded Solomon his son , saying ,
now therefore don '@@ t hold him guil@@ t@@ less , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gra@@ y head down to She@@ ol with blood . "
the days that David re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel were for@@ ty years ; he re@@ ig@@ ned seven years in He@@ br@@ on , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years in Jer@@ usalem .
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est to Yah@@ we@@ h , that he might fulfill the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
the news came to Jo@@ a@@ b ; for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn after Ab@@ sal@@ om . Jo@@ a@@ b fled to the tent of Yah@@ we@@ h , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
it was told king Solomon , " Jo@@ a@@ b has fled to the tent of Yah@@ we@@ h , and be@@ hold , he is by the alt@@ ar . " then Solomon sent Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , " G@@ o , fall on him . "
so shall their blood return on the head of Jo@@ a@@ b , and on the head of his se@@ ed fore@@ ver . but to David , and to his se@@ ed , and to his house , and to his th@@ r@@ one , there shall be peace fore@@ ver from Yah@@ we@@ h . "
then Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , know for certain that you shall su@@ rely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away to A@@ ch@@ ish , son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah , king of G@@ ath . they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , " be@@ hold , your servants are in G@@ ath . "
the king said moreover to Shi@@ me@@ i , " You know all the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess which your heart is priv@@ y to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yah@@ we@@ h shall return your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess on your own head .
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
the king went to Gi@@ be@@ on to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place . Solomon offered a thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on that alt@@ ar .
now , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , you have made your ser@@ vant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don '@@ t know how to go out or come in .
your ser@@ vant is in the mid@@ st of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed nor counted for multi@@ tude .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
Solomon aw@@ oke ; and be@@ hold , it was a dream . then he came to Jer@@ usalem , and stood before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and offered up bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , offered peace offer@@ ings , and made a feast to all his servants .
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
she ar@@ ose at midnight , and took my son from bes@@ ide me , while your hand@@ ma@@ id sle@@ pt , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
when I rose in the morning to nur@@ se my child , be@@ hold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , whom I b@@ ore . "
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud , in Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth Sh@@ ean which is bes@@ ide Z@@ are@@ than , ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth Sh@@ ean to A@@ bel Me@@ ho@@ lah , as far as beyond Jok@@ me@@ am ;
Ben Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ( to him belonged the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; to him belonged the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in B@@ ash@@ an , six@@ ty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri , in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Solomon ruled over all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms from the River to the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tri@@ bute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten head of f@@ at c@@ attle , and twenty head of c@@ attle out of the pas@@ tures , and one hundred she@@ ep , besides har@@ ts , and gaz@@ el@@ les , and ro@@ e@@ bu@@ cks , and f@@ atten@@ ed fo@@ w@@ l .
for he had domin@@ ion over all on this side the River , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
for he was wis@@ er than all men ; than E@@ than the E@@ z@@ rah@@ ite , and H@@ eman , and Cal@@ col , and Dar@@ da , the sons of Ma@@ hol : and his f@@ ame was in all the nations all around .
he spoke of trees , from the c@@ ed@@ ar that is in Lebanon even to the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p that spr@@ ings out of the wall ; he spoke also of animals , and of birds , and of cre@@ eping things , and of fish .
H@@ i@@ ram king of T@@ y@@ re sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted him king in the place of his father : for H@@ i@@ ram was ever a l@@ over of David .
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Yah@@ we@@ h put them under the so@@ les of his feet .
H@@ i@@ ram sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning tim@@ ber of c@@ ed@@ ar , and concerning tim@@ ber of f@@ ir .
Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of p@@ ure oil . Solomon gave this to H@@ i@@ ram year by year .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Ad@@ on@@ i@@ ram was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
it happened in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zi@@ v , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was its length , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house . ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was its b@@ read@@ th before the house .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the ne@@ ther@@ most story was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; for on the outside he made off@@ sets in the wall of the house all around , that the be@@ ams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quar@@ ry ; and there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ce@@ iling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of f@@ ir .
he prepared an or@@ acle in the mid@@ st of the house within , to set there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h .
within the or@@ acle was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in its he@@ ight ; and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold : and he covered the alt@@ ar with c@@ ed@@ ar .
so Solomon over@@ laid the house within with p@@ ure gold : and he drew cha@@ ins of gold across before the or@@ acle ; and he over@@ laid it with gold .
the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole alt@@ ar that belonged to the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the he@@ ight of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and so was it of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m within the in@@ ner house ; and the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were stret@@ ched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
so he made two doors of olive wood ; and he car@@ ved on them car@@ v@@ ings of ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m and pal@@ m trees and open flowers , and over@@ laid them with gold ; and he spread the gold on the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , and on the pal@@ m trees .
and two doors of f@@ ir wood : the two leaves of the one door were fol@@ ding , and the two leaves of the other door were fol@@ ding .
in the ele@@ venth year , in the month B@@ ul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
he made the por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a por@@ ch before them ; and pil@@ lars and a threshold before them .
his house where he was to d@@ well , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
he made two capitals of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set on the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
there were n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pil@@ lars , close by the bel@@ ly which was bes@@ ide the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred , in ro@@ ws around on the other capital .
he set up the pil@@ lars at the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
he made the m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and its he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
it was a hand@@ b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick : and its bri@@ m was worked like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , like the f@@ lower of a L@@ ily : it held two thousand ba@@ ths .
the work of the bases was like this : they had pan@@ els ; and there were pan@@ els between the led@@ ges ;
and on the pan@@ els that were between the led@@ ges were li@@ ons , ox@@ en , and ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m ; and on the led@@ ges there was a pe@@ dest@@ al above ; and ben@@ e@@ ath the li@@ ons and ox@@ en were w@@ re@@ aths of han@@ ging work .
every base had four bronze whe@@ els , and ax@@ les of br@@ ass ; and the four feet of it had supports : ben@@ e@@ ath the bas@@ in were the supports m@@ ol@@ ten , with w@@ re@@ aths at the side of each .
the four whe@@ els were under@@ ne@@ ath the pan@@ els ; and the ax@@ les of the whe@@ els were in the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and half a cu@@ bit .
the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ les , and their ri@@ ms , and their spok@@ es , and their nav@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass half a cu@@ bit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its pan@@ els were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its pan@@ els , he en@@ gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the space of each , with w@@ re@@ aths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard , toward the south .
H@@ i@@ ram made the bas@@ ins , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins . so H@@ i@@ ram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h :
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pil@@ lars ;
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins : even all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , were of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : the golden alt@@ ar , and the table where@@ upon the show bread was , of gold ;
and the lam@@ p@@ stands , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the or@@ acle , of p@@ ure gold ; and the flowers , and the lam@@ ps , and the ton@@ gs , of gold ;
and the c@@ ups , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , of the temp@@ le , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
they brought up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; even these the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , who were assemb@@ led to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h to its place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k except the two tables of stone which Mos@@ es put there at Ho@@ re@@ b , when Yah@@ we@@ h made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests had come out of the hol@@ y place , that the cl@@ oud filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister by reason of the cl@@ oud ; for the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed is Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his m@@ outh to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
but Yah@@ we@@ h said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
Yah@@ we@@ h has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
there I have set a place for the Ar@@ k , in which is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heav@@ en ;
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" now therefore , God of Israel , ple@@ ase let your word be ver@@ ified , which you spoke to your ser@@ vant David my father .
but will God in very de@@ ed d@@ well on the ear@@ th ? be@@ hold , heav@@ en and the heav@@ en of heav@@ ens can '@@ t contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and for his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you this day ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant shall pra@@ y toward this place .
listen to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place . yes , hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
" if a man sin@@ s against his neigh@@ bor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swe@@ ar , and he comes and swe@@ ar before your alt@@ ar in this house ;
then hear in heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head , and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
" when your people Israel are struck down before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they turn again to you , and conf@@ ess your name , and pra@@ y and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in this house :
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fa@@ thers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ lic@@ t them :
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
" if there is fam@@ ine in the land , if there is p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , if there is b@@ light , mil@@ dew , loc@@ ust or cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lar ; if their enemy bes@@ i@@ eg@@ es them in the land of their cities ; whatever pla@@ gue , whatever si@@ ck@@ ness there is ;
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the pla@@ gue of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fa@@ thers .
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and of your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ) ; when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall rep@@ ent in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of those who carried them cap@@ tive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely ; we have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their enem@@ ies , who carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y to you toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and for@@ give your people who have sin@@ ned against you , and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions in which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against you ; and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before those who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them
( for they are your people , and your inher@@ it@@ ance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your people Israel , to listen to them wh@@ en@@ ever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread forth toward heav@@ en .
" b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
let these my words , with which I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h , be near to Yah@@ we@@ h our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his stat@@ utes , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , as at this day . "
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , which he offered to Yah@@ we@@ h , two and twenty thousand head of c@@ attle , and one hundred twenty thousand she@@ ep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , to do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel fore@@ ver , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and my stat@@ utes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made hol@@ y for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the king 's house
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
H@@ i@@ ram came out from T@@ y@@ re to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ple@@ ase him .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and that which Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people who were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the H@@ itti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a lev@@ y of bon@@ d@@ servants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bon@@ d@@ servants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fif@@ ty , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
King Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
H@@ i@@ ram sent in the nav@@ y his servants , sa@@ il@@ ors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
she came to Jer@@ usalem with a very great train , with ca@@ me@@ ls that b@@ ore sp@@ ices , and very much gold , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she talked with him of all that was in her heart .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wis@@ dom .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . be@@ hold , the half was not told me ! your wis@@ dom and prosperity exceed the f@@ ame which I heard .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six tal@@ ents of gold ,
besides that which the tr@@ aders brought , and the traffic of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
there were six steps to the th@@ r@@ one , and the top of the th@@ r@@ one was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons standing bes@@ ide the stays .
twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
they brought every man his tri@@ bute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clo@@ thing , and arm@@ or , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
the hor@@ ses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received them in dro@@ ves , each dro@@ ve at a price .
a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty ; and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
for it happened , when Solomon was old , that his wi@@ ves turned away his heart after other go@@ ds ; and his heart was not perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , on the mountain that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
therefore Yah@@ we@@ h said to Solomon , " Bec@@ ause this is done by you , and you have not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded you , I will su@@ rely tear the k@@ ing@@ dom from you , and will give it to your ser@@ vant .
however I will not tear away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but I will give one tri@@ be to your son , for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
for it happened , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , and had struck every male in E@@ dom
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an ; and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
Had@@ ad found great fav@@ or in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the qu@@ een .
the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es b@@ ore him Gen@@ ub@@ ath his son , whom Tah@@ pen@@ es we@@ an@@ ed in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ; and Gen@@ ub@@ ath was in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house among the sons of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " Let me de@@ part , that I may go to my own country . "
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Dam@@ as@@ cus , and lived there@@ in , and re@@ ig@@ ned in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite of Zer@@ ed@@ ah , a ser@@ vant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a wi@@ dow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Mil@@ lo , and rep@@ aired the breach of the city of David his father .
the man Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industri@@ ous , and he put him in charge of all the la@@ bor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field .
A@@ hij@@ ah laid hold of the new gar@@ ment that was on him , and t@@ ore it in twelve pieces .
( but he shall have one tri@@ be , for my ser@@ vant David 's sake and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the k@@ ing@@ dom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tri@@ bes .
to his son will I give one tri@@ be , that David my ser@@ vant may have a lam@@ p always before me in Jer@@ usalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ; but Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ar@@ ose , and fled into Egypt , to S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
" your father made our yok@@ e gri@@ ev@@ ous : now therefore make you the gri@@ ev@@ ous service of your father , and his heavy yok@@ e which he put on us , ligh@@ ter , and we will serve you . "
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took coun@@ sel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What coun@@ sel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a ser@@ vant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants fore@@ ver . "
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
so the king di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he might establish his word , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was returned , that they sent and called him to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
" speak to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
if this people goes up to offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lor@@ d , even to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they will kill me , and return to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h . "
be@@ hold , there came a man of God out of Ju@@ da@@ h by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h to Beth El : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was standing by the alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se .
the alt@@ ar also was split apart , and the ashes p@@ oured out from the alt@@ ar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the man of God said to the king , " E@@ ven if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it comman@@ ded me by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
now there lived an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
for it was said to me by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to the pro@@ phe@@ t who brought him back ;
and he cri@@ ed to the man of God who came from Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' Bec@@ ause you have been dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment which Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you ,
but came back , and have e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fa@@ thers . ' "
it happened , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led the don@@ key for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the don@@ key stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t lived .
the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old pro@@ phe@@ t to mour@@ n , and to bur@@ y him .
it happened , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , " When I am dead , then bur@@ y me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried . lay my b@@ ones bes@@ ide his b@@ ones .
for the saying which he cri@@ ed by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h against the alt@@ ar in Be@@ the@@ l , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samar@@ ia , will su@@ rely happen . "
this thing became sin to the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
take with you ten lo@@ aves , and cak@@ es , and a j@@ ar of hon@@ ey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and ar@@ ose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . now A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and t@@ ore the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done ev@@ il above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . " '
he will give Israel up because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , which he has sin@@ ned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife ar@@ ose , and depar@@ ted , and came to Tir@@ z@@ ah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the guard b@@ ore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
he brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben Had@@ ad list@@ ened to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel Beth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
it happened , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and lived in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
then king A@@ SA made a proc@@ lamation to all Ju@@ da@@ h ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and its tim@@ ber , with which Ba@@ as@@ ha had built ; and king A@@ SA built there@@ with Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha struck him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel were lay@@ ing siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
for the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provoc@@ ation with which he provoked Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
" because I ex@@ al@@ ted you out of the d@@ ust , and made you pr@@ ince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and have made my people Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with their sin@@ s ;
be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly swe@@ ep away Ba@@ as@@ ha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
the do@@ gs will eat Ba@@ as@@ ha 's des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
his ser@@ vant Z@@ im@@ ri , captain of half his char@@ i@@ ots , consp@@ ired against him . now he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the house of Ar@@ za , who was over the household in Tir@@ z@@ ah :
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he struck all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave him a single one who ur@@ in@@ ates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
the people who were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri has consp@@ ired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
it happened , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sin@@ s which he sin@@ ned in doing that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , in walk@@ ing in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he committed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin@@ s with which he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he showed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ eighth year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel in Samar@@ ia twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years .
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took as wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
A@@ ha@@ b made the Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ ha@@ b did yet more to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
it shall be , that you shall drink of the Bro@@ ok . I have comman@@ ded the ra@@ ven@@ s to fe@@ ed you there . "
so he went and did according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for he went and lived by the Bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before the Jordan .
the ra@@ ven@@ s brought him bread and f@@ les@@ h in the morning , and bread and f@@ les@@ h in the evening ; and he d@@ rank of the Bro@@ ok .
Eli@@ j@@ ah said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little c@@ ake first , and bring it out to me , and after@@ ward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' The j@@ ar of me@@ al shall not empty , neither shall the j@@ ar of oil fail , until the day that Yah@@ we@@ h sends rain on the ear@@ th . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Eli@@ j@@ ah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the j@@ ar of me@@ al di@@ d@@ n '@@ t empty , neither did the j@@ ar of oil fail , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by Eli@@ j@@ ah .
it happened after these things , that the son of the woman , the mist@@ ress of the house , fell si@@ ck ; and his si@@ ck@@ ness was so severe , that there was no bre@@ ath left in him .
he said to her , " Gi@@ ve me your son . " he took him out of her bos@@ om , and carried him up into the room where he stayed , and laid him on his own bed .
Yah@@ we@@ h list@@ ened to the voice of Eli@@ j@@ ah ; and the sou@@ l of the child came into him again , and he revi@@ ved .
Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , " be@@ hold , your son lives . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Eli@@ j@@ ah , in the third year , saying , " G@@ o , show yo@@ ur@@ self to A@@ ha@@ b ; and I will send rain on the ear@@ th . "
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Yah@@ we@@ h , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took one hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , be@@ hold , Eli@@ j@@ ah met him : and he recogn@@ ized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lor@@ d Eli@@ j@@ ah ? "
W@@ as@@ n '@@ t it told my lor@@ d what I did when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel killed the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Yah@@ we@@ h , how I hi@@ d one hundred men of Yah@@ we@@ h 's pro@@ ph@@ ets with fif@@ ty to a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water ?
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Eli@@ j@@ ah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , to whom the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ l in pieces , and laid it on the wood . he said , " fill four j@@ ars with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and on the wood . "
then the fire of Yah@@ we@@ h fell , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the d@@ ust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the tren@@ ch .
Eli@@ j@@ ah said to them , " se@@ ize the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Ba@@ al ! D@@ on '@@ t let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Eli@@ j@@ ah brought them down to the Bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and killed them there .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he bo@@ wed himself down on the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es .
when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
he looked , and be@@ hold , there was at his head a c@@ ake bak@@ ed on the co@@ als , and a j@@ ar of water . he ate and d@@ rank , and lay down again .
he came there to a cave , and lo@@ d@@ ged there ; and be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ? "
it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . be@@ hold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el , J@@ eh@@ u will kill ; and he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u , E@@ lis@@ ha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the k@@ ne@@ es which have not bo@@ wed to Ba@@ al , and every m@@ outh which has not k@@ is@@ sed him . "
Ben Had@@ ad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @@@ -@@ @ two kings with him , and hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots : and he went up and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Samar@@ ia , and fought against it .
the mes@@ sen@@ gers came again , and said , " Ben Had@@ ad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wi@@ ves , and your children ;
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleas@@ ant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
then he mu@@ ster@@ ed the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two . after them , he mu@@ ster@@ ed all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Had@@ ad was drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the pav@@ ili@@ ons , he and the kings , the thirty @@@ -@@ @ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Had@@ ad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samar@@ ia . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
the servants of the king of Syria said to him , " The@@ ir go@@ d is a go@@ d of the hil@@ ls ; therefore they were stronger than we . but let us fight against them in the pla@@ in , and su@@ rely we shall be stronger than they .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Had@@ ad mu@@ ster@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
they en@@ camp@@ ed one over against the other seven days . so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined ; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot@@ men of the Syri@@ ans in one day .
but the rest fled to A@@ ph@@ ek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand men who were left . Ben Had@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an in@@ ner room .
as your ser@@ vant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " S@@ o your judgment shall be ; you yo@@ ur@@ self have decided it . "
so she wrote letters in A@@ ha@@ b 's name , and sealed them with his se@@ al , and sent the letters to the el@@ ders and to the no@@ bles who were in his city , who lived with Nab@@ o@@ th .
set two men , base fel@@ lows , before him , and let them testify against him , saying , ' You Cur@@ sed God and the king ! ' then carry him out , and stone him to death . "
the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who lived in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , who d@@ wel@@ ls in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , he is in the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on you , and will ut@@ ter@@ ly swe@@ ep you away and will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah for the provoc@@ ation with which you have provoked me to an@@ ger , and have made Israel to sin . "
the do@@ gs will eat he who dies of A@@ ha@@ b in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
now the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h were sitting each on his th@@ r@@ one , ar@@ ray@@ ed in their rob@@ es , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets were pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying before them .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and struck Mic@@ ai@@ ah on the che@@ ek , and said , " Wh@@ ich way did the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h go from me to speak to you ? "
say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and fe@@ ed him with bread of aff@@ li@@ ction and with water of aff@@ li@@ ction , until I come in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " su@@ rely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bo@@ w at ran@@ dom , and struck the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the arm@@ or . therefore he said to the driver of his char@@ i@@ ot , " Tur@@ n your hand , and carry me out of the battle ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . the king was pro@@ pped up in his char@@ i@@ ot facing the Syri@@ ans , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wo@@ und into the bottom of the char@@ i@@ ot .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
they was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot by the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood where the pro@@ stitu@@ tes was@@ hed themselves ; according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
he walked in all the way of A@@ SA his father ; He di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he showed , and how he war@@ red , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , in which he made Israel to sin .
but the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to Eli@@ j@@ ah the T@@ ish@@ bi@@ te , " arise , go up to meet the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the king of Samar@@ ia , and tell them , ' Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you go to inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al Ze@@ bu@@ b , the go@@ d of E@@ kr@@ on ?
then the king sent a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty to him . he went up to him ; and be@@ hold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' C@@ ome down ! ' "
be@@ hold , fire came down from the sky , and consu@@ med the two former cap@@ tains of fif@@ ty with their fif@@ ties . but now let my life be pre@@ ci@@ ous in your sight . "
so he died according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which Eli@@ j@@ ah had spoken . J@@ eh@@ or@@ am began to reign in his place in the second year of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
Eli@@ j@@ ah took his man@@ tle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on d@@ ry ground .
he said , " You have asked a hard thing . if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that be@@ hold , a char@@ i@@ ot of fire and hor@@ ses of fire separated them ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
E@@ lis@@ ha saw it , and he cri@@ ed , " My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ se@@ men ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clo@@ th@@ es , and t@@ ore them in two pieces .
he took up also the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
he took the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and struck the waters , and said , " W@@ here is Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Eli@@ j@@ ah ? " when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and E@@ lis@@ ha went over .
when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah rests on E@@ lis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
the men of the city said to E@@ lis@@ ha , " be@@ hold , ple@@ ase , the situation of this city is pleas@@ ant , as my lor@@ d sees ; but the water is bad , and the land mis@@ carries . "
he went out to the spring of the waters , and threw salt into it , and said , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' I have he@@ aled these waters . there shall not be from there any more death or mis@@ carrying . ' "
he went up from there to Be@@ the@@ l . as he was going up by the way , some you@@ ths came out of the city and mo@@ cked him , and said to him , " G@@ o up , you bal@@ dy ! go up , you bal@@ d@@ head ! "
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cur@@ sed them in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h . two female be@@ ars came out of the wo@@ ods , and ma@@ uled for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two of those you@@ ths .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pil@@ lar of Ba@@ al that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from it .
now Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ a@@ b was a she@@ ep bre@@ eder ; and he ren@@ dered to the king of Israel the wo@@ ol of one hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and of one hundred thousand r@@ ams .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the king of E@@ dom ; and they made a cir@@ cu@@ it of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and your animals .
you shall strike every for@@ ti@@ fied city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all spr@@ ings of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
it happened in the morning , about the time of offering the offering , that be@@ hold , water came by the way of E@@ dom , and the country was filled with water .
now when all the Mo@@ abi@@ tes heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on arm@@ or , and up@@ ward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one on the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and struck the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes .
when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew s@@ word , to break through to the king of E@@ dom ; but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son who would have re@@ ig@@ ned in his place , and offered him for a bur@@ n@@ t offering on the wall . there was great wr@@ ath against Israel : and they depar@@ ted from him , and returned to their own land .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and p@@ our out into all those contain@@ ers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the contain@@ ers to her , and she p@@ oured out .
it fell on a day , that E@@ lis@@ ha passed to Sh@@ un@@ em , where there was a prominent woman ; and she persu@@ aded him to eat bread . so it was , that as often as he passed by , he turned in there to eat bread .
ple@@ ase let us make a little room on the wall . let us set for him there a bed , a table , a chair , and a lam@@ p stand . it shall be , when he comes to us , that he shall turn in there . "
she called to her husband , and said , " P@@ le@@ ase send me one of the servants , and one of the don@@ ke@@ ys , that I may run to the man of God , and come again . "
then she s@@ add@@ led a don@@ key , and said to her ser@@ vant , " D@@ ri@@ ve , and go forward ! D@@ on '@@ t slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
so she went , and came to the man of God to Mount Car@@ mel . it happened , when the man of God saw her af@@ ar off , that he said to Ge@@ hazi his ser@@ vant , " be@@ hold , there is the Sh@@ un@@ am@@ m@@ ite .
when E@@ lis@@ ha had come into the house , be@@ hold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his m@@ outh on his m@@ outh , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stret@@ ched himself on him ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child grew warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stret@@ ched himself on him . then the child s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
E@@ lis@@ ha came again to G@@ ilg@@ al . there was a fam@@ ine in the land ; and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets were sitting before him ; and he said to his ser@@ vant , " S@@ et on the great po@@ t , and bo@@ il ste@@ w for the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . "
one went out into the field to gather her@@ bs , and found a wild v@@ ine , and gathered of it wild go@@ ur@@ ds his la@@ p full , and came and sh@@ red them into the po@@ t of ste@@ w ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize them .
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were e@@ ating of the ste@@ w , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the po@@ t ! " they could not eat of it .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and hon@@ or@@ able , because by him Yah@@ we@@ h had given victory to Syria : he was also a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or , but he was a le@@ per .
the Syri@@ ans had gone out in bands , and had brought away cap@@ tive out of the land of Israel a little ma@@ iden ; and she w@@ aited on Na@@ aman 's wife .
someone went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , " The ma@@ iden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , be@@ hold , I have sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to you , that you may he@@ al him of his le@@ pro@@ sy . "
it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , " Wh@@ y have you torn your clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel . "
A@@ ren '@@ t A@@ ban@@ ah and P@@ har@@ p@@ ar , the rivers of Dam@@ as@@ cus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I was@@ h in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a ra@@ ge .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his f@@ les@@ h was restored like the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
but as one was fel@@ ling a be@@ am , the ax@@ e head fell into the water . then he cri@@ ed , and said , " A@@ las , my master ! for it was borro@@ wed . "
now the king of Syria was war@@ ring against Israel ; and he took coun@@ sel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " won '@@ t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
he said , " G@@ o and see where he is , that I may send and get him . " it was told him , saying , " be@@ hold , he is in Do@@ than . "
it happened , when they had come into Samar@@ ia , that E@@ lis@@ ha said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yah@@ we@@ h opened their eyes , and they saw ; and be@@ hold , they were in the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia .
there was a great fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , until a don@@ key 's head was sold for eigh@@ ty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a ka@@ b of do@@ ve 's D@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
so we bo@@ iled my son , and ate him : and I said to her on the next day , ' Gi@@ ve your son , that we may eat him ; ' and she has hidden her son . "
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th under@@ ne@@ ath on his f@@ les@@ h .
they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go to the camp of the Syri@@ ans . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syri@@ ans , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
therefore they ar@@ ose and fled in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and left their ten@@ ts , and their hor@@ ses , and their don@@ ke@@ ys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and be@@ hold , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and pl@@ under@@ ed the camp of the Syri@@ ans . so a measure of fine fl@@ our was sold for a sh@@ ek@@ el , and two measures of bar@@ ley for a sh@@ ek@@ el , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the woman ar@@ ose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
it happened at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
it happened on the next day , that he took a th@@ ick clo@@ th , di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Haz@@ a@@ el re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being king of Ju@@ da@@ h then , J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife . he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then Jor@@ am passed over to Z@@ air , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots ; and the people fled to their ten@@ ts .
the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
E@@ lis@@ ha the pro@@ phe@@ t called one of the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and said to him , " P@@ ut your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , take this vi@@ al of oil in your hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
when you come there , find J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an in@@ ner room .
then take the vi@@ al of oil , and p@@ our it on his head , and say , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I have ano@@ in@@ ted you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don '@@ t wait . "
he ar@@ ose , and went into the house . then he p@@ oured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' I have ano@@ in@@ ted you king over the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of A@@ ha@@ b your master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of Yah@@ we@@ h , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish . I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of A@@ ha@@ b like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah .
J@@ eh@@ u drew his bo@@ w with his full strength , and struck Jor@@ am between his arms ; and the ar@@ row went out at his heart , and he sun@@ k down in his char@@ i@@ ot .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on the wall , and on the hor@@ ses . then he tr@@ amp@@ led her under fo@@ ot .
they went to bur@@ y her ; but they found no more of her than the s@@ kul@@ l , and the feet , and the pal@@ ms of her hands .
and the body of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel shall be as D@@ ung on the face of the field in the portion of J@@ ez@@ reel , so that they shall not say , " This is J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel . " ' "
now A@@ ha@@ b had sev@@ enty sons in Samar@@ ia . J@@ eh@@ u wrote letters , and sent to Samar@@ ia , to the rul@@ ers of J@@ ez@@ reel , even the el@@ ders , and to those who brought up the sons of A@@ ha@@ b , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ ses , a for@@ ti@@ fied city also , and arm@@ or .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent them to him to J@@ ez@@ reel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righ@@ te@@ ous . be@@ hold , I consp@@ ired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the ear@@ th of the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke concerning the house of A@@ ha@@ b . for Yah@@ we@@ h has done that which he spoke by his ser@@ vant Eli@@ j@@ ah . "
so J@@ eh@@ u struck all that remained of the house of A@@ ha@@ b in J@@ ez@@ reel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his pri@@ ests , until he left him none remaining .
when he came to Samar@@ ia , he struck all who remained to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel ; and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was filled from one end to another .
however from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from after them , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but J@@ eh@@ u took no heed to walk in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h around the king .
you shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the cap@@ tains over hundreds did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains over hundreds the spe@@ ars and shi@@ elds that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
when Ath@@ ali@@ ah heard the no@@ ise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h :
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Br@@ ing her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the s@@ word . " for the pri@@ est said , " D@@ on '@@ t let her be sla@@ in in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the hor@@ ses ' entry to the king 's house . she was sla@@ in there .
all the people of the land went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images broke they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he took the cap@@ tains over hundreds , and the Car@@ ites , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
so all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and the city was quiet . Ath@@ ali@@ ah they had sla@@ in with the s@@ word at the king 's house .
let the pri@@ ests take it to them , every man from his acqu@@ ain@@ tance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wher@@ ever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est took a ch@@ est , and bo@@ red a hol@@ e in its li@@ d , and set it bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and the pri@@ ests who kept the threshold put there@@ in all the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they paid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and the buil@@ ders , who worked on the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
and to the mas@@ ons and the stone cut@@ ters , and for buying tim@@ ber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h c@@ ups of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ins , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
moreover they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully .
the money for the t@@ res@@ pass offer@@ ings , and the money for the sin offer@@ ings , was not brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : it was the pri@@ ests ' .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
his servants ar@@ ose , and made a con@@ spir@@ acy , and struck Jo@@ ash at the house of Mil@@ lo , on the way that goes down to Sil@@ la .
for Joz@@ ac@@ ar the son of Shi@@ me@@ ath , and Je@@ ho@@ zab@@ ad the son of Sho@@ mer , his servants , struck him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from it .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben@@ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , continu@@ ally .
( Yah@@ we@@ h gave Israel a Sav@@ ior , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syri@@ ans ; and the children of Israel lived in their ten@@ ts as before .
nevertheless they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked there@@ in : and there remained the Ash@@ er@@ ah also in Samar@@ ia . )
for he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz of the people any more than fif@@ ty hor@@ se@@ men , and ten char@@ i@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the d@@ ust in th@@ res@@ hing .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , and all that he did , and his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked there@@ in .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
now E@@ lis@@ ha was fallen si@@ ck of his si@@ ck@@ ness of which he died : and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down to him , and we@@ pt over him , and said , " My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ se@@ men ! "
he said to the king of Israel , " P@@ ut your hand on the bo@@ w " ; and he put his hand on it . E@@ lis@@ ha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
E@@ lis@@ ha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes inv@@ aded the land at the coming in of the year .
it happened , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band ; and they cast the man into the tomb of E@@ lis@@ ha : and as soon as the man touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ add@@ in of Jer@@ usalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Jo@@ ash his father had done .
it happened , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had sla@@ in the king his father :
but A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah would not listen . so Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h .
Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and came to Jer@@ usalem , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the host@@ ages also , and returned to Samar@@ ia .

all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the place of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yah@@ we@@ h saw the aff@@ li@@ ction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any hel@@ per for Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t say that he would blo@@ t out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he sav@@ ed them by the hand of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash .

six@@ teen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ ol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .
Yah@@ we@@ h struck the king , so that he was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house . Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the household , jud@@ ging the people of the land .

he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as his fa@@ thers had done : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .

this was the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to J@@ eh@@ u , saying , " Y@@ our sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i went up from Tir@@ z@@ ah , and came to Samar@@ ia , and struck S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h in Samar@@ ia , and killed him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .

there came against the land P@@ ul the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and Men@@ a@@ hem gave P@@ ul one thousand tal@@ ents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the k@@ ing@@ dom in his hand .

Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a con@@ spir@@ acy against Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and struck him , and killed him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his place , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .

he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h ; he did according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria and Pek@@ ah son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah king of Israel came up to Jer@@ usalem to war : and they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed A@@ haz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria recovered E@@ la@@ th to Syria , and dro@@ ve the Jews from E@@ la@@ th ; and the Syri@@ ans came to E@@ la@@ th , and lived there , to this day .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th P@@ il@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , " I am your ser@@ vant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a list@@ ened to him ; and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a went up against Dam@@ as@@ cus , and took it , and carried its people cap@@ tive to K@@ ir , and killed Re@@ z@@ in .
U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est built an alt@@ ar : according to all that king A@@ haz had sent from Dam@@ as@@ cus , so U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est made it for the coming of king A@@ haz from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
when the king had come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king drew near to the alt@@ ar , and offered on it .
he bur@@ n@@ t his bur@@ n@@ t offering and his me@@ al offering , and p@@ oured his drink offering , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood of his peace offer@@ ings , on the alt@@ ar .
the bronze alt@@ ar , which was before Yah@@ we@@ h , he brought from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between his alt@@ ar and the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and put it on the north side of his alt@@ ar .
King A@@ haz cut off the pan@@ els of the bases , and removed the bas@@ in from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze ox@@ en that were under it , and put it on a pav@@ ement of stone .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and had fear@@ ed other go@@ ds ,
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secre@@ tly things that were not right against Yah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the for@@ ti@@ fied city ;
and there they bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h carried away before them ; and they worked w@@ ic@@ ked things to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , they would not listen , but har@@ dened their nec@@ k , like the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe in Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
they for@@ so@@ ok all the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served Ba@@ al .
they caused their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and en@@ chan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
therefore Yah@@ we@@ h was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
Yah@@ we@@ h rejected all the se@@ ed of Israel , and aff@@ lic@@ ted them , and delivered them into the hand of sp@@ o@@ ilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he t@@ ore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at king : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am dro@@ ve Israel from following Yah@@ we@@ h , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he did ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from them ;
until Yah@@ we@@ h removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a to this day .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ va , and from Ham@@ ath and Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel ; and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and lived in the cities of it .
so it was , at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore Yah@@ we@@ h sent li@@ ons among them , which killed some of them .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a comman@@ ded , saying , " Car@@ ry there one of the pri@@ ests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and d@@ well there , and let him te@@ ach them the law of the go@@ d of the land . "
so one of the pri@@ ests whom they had carried away from Samar@@ ia came and lived in Be@@ the@@ l , and ta@@ ught them how they should fear Yah@@ we@@ h .
however every nation made go@@ ds of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
so they fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h , and made to them from among themselves pri@@ ests of the high places , who sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom Yah@@ we@@ h had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and comman@@ ded them , saying , " You shall not fear other go@@ ds , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
but you shall fear Yah@@ we@@ h , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and you shall bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to him , and you shall sacrifice to him .
the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , and the law and the comman@@ d@@ ment , which he wrote for you , you shall observe to do fore@@ ver@@ more . you shall not fear other go@@ ds .
you shall not forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I have made with you ; neither shall you fear other go@@ ds .
now it happened in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pil@@ lars , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah : and he broke in pieces the bronze ser@@ p@@ ent that Mos@@ es had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incen@@ se to it ; and he called it Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ tan .
he tr@@ usted in Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des ,
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , but trans@@ g@@ ressed his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , even all that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great army to Jer@@ usalem . they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order .
you say ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) , ' There is coun@@ sel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebel@@ led against me ?
now , be@@ hold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even in Egypt . if a man le@@ ans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it . so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , ple@@ ase give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
has any of the go@@ ds of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
where are the go@@ ds of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ p@@ ad ? where are the go@@ ds of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , of H@@ ena , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? have they delivered Samar@@ ia out of my hand ?
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , came with She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
it happened , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
they said to him , " Th@@ us says H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , ' This day is a day of trouble , of re@@ bu@@ ke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the point of birth , and there is no strength to deliver them .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
when he heard it said of Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , " be@@ hold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , Jer@@ usalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den that were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it . then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and spread it before Yah@@ we@@ h .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah pray@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who sit above the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , you are the God , even you alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th . you have made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yah@@ we@@ h our God , save us , I be@@ g you , out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that you , Yah@@ we@@ h , are God alone . "
whom have you de@@ fied and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? against whom have you ex@@ al@@ ted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to lay waste for@@ ti@@ fied cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded . they were like the gr@@ ass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like gra@@ in b@@ lasted before it has grown up .
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
" ' this shall be the sign to you : you shall eat this year that which gro@@ ws of itself , and in the second year that which spr@@ ings of the same ; and in the third year so@@ w , and re@@ ap , and plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and eat its fruit .
" therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , ' He shall not come to this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mo@@ und against it .
it happened that night , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out , and struck one hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er struck him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Ar@@ ar@@ at . E@@ sar H@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
in those days was H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah si@@ ck to death . I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z came to him , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' S@@ et your house in order ; for you shall die , and not live . ' "
" remember now , Yah@@ we@@ h , I be@@ g you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
it happened , before I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying ,
I will add to your days fif@@ teen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake . " ' "
I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . N@@ ay , but let the shadow return back@@ ward ten steps . "
at that time Ber@@ od@@ ach Bal@@ adan the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah ; for he had heard that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had been si@@ ck .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing shall be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ O@@ f your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on . ' "
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Hep@@ h@@ zi@@ bah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , as did A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he made his son to pass through the fire , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
I will cast off the re@@ mn@@ ant of my inher@@ it@@ ance , and deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies . they will become a pre@@ y and a sp@@ oil to all their enem@@ ies ;
because they have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
Am@@ on was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the id@@ ols that his father served , and wor@@ shi@@ ped them :
and he for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fa@@ thers , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t walk in the way of Yah@@ we@@ h .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty @@@ -@@ @ one years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Boz@@ kat@@ h .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , which the ke@@ epers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully . "
H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . " H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Y@@ our servants have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who have the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be told the king , saying , " H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est has delivered a book to me . " Sha@@ ph@@ an read it before the king .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has read .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' "
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : ' concerning the words which you have heard ,
'@@ T@@ her@@ e@@ fore be@@ hold , I will gather you to your fa@@ thers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the ev@@ il which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
he brought out the Ash@@ er@@ ah from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , outside of Jer@@ usalem , to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and beat it to d@@ ust , and cast its d@@ ust on the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the pri@@ ests of the high places di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come up to the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h in Jer@@ usalem , but they ate un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread among their brothers .
he def@@ iled Top@@ het@@ h , which is in the val@@ ley of the children of Hin@@ no@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mo@@ le@@ ch .
he broke in pieces the pil@@ lars , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ im , and filled their places with the b@@ ones of men .
moreover the alt@@ ar that was at Be@@ the@@ l , and the high place which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that alt@@ ar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to d@@ ust , and burned the Ash@@ er@@ ah .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
he killed all the pri@@ ests of the high places that were there , on the al@@ tar@@ s , and burned men 's b@@ ones on them ; and he returned to Jer@@ usalem .
su@@ rely there was not kept such a P@@ ass@@ over from the days of the judges who jud@@ ged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yah@@ we@@ h with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , with which his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h put him in bonds at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jer@@ usalem ; and put the land to a tri@@ bute of one hundred tal@@ ents of silver , and a tal@@ ent of gold .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h made Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king in the place of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and changed his name to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im : but he took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz away ; and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ze@@ bi@@ da@@ h the daughter of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah of Rum@@ ah .
Yah@@ we@@ h sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
the king of Egypt di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had taken , from the Bro@@ ok of Egypt to the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was E@@ igh@@ teen years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem three months : and his mother 's name was Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ ta the daughter of El@@ na@@ than of Jer@@ usalem .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his father had done .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , as Yah@@ we@@ h had said .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ one years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
for through the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h , it happened in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence . Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
on the ninth day of the fourth month the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took him in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to Jer@@ usalem .
he bur@@ n@@ t the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jer@@ usalem .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke up the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and carried the br@@ ass pieces to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the captain of the guard took away the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pil@@ lars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck them , and put them to death at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his land .
as for the people who were left in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , governor .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ite , they and their men .
G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah s@@ wor@@ e to them and to their men , and said to them , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid because of the servants of the Chal@@ de@@ ans . d@@ well in the land , and serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and it shall be well with you . "
but it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the royal se@@ ed came , and ten men with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the forces , ar@@ ose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
it happened in the seven and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the cap@@ tivity of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , on the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , that E@@ vil@@ mer@@ od@@ ach king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h out of prison ;

it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his sons fallen on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
they stri@@ pped him , and took his head , and his arm@@ or , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to their id@@ ols , and to the people .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and took away the body of Sa@@ ul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and buried their b@@ ones under the o@@ ak in J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and fas@@ ted seven days .
in times past , even when Sa@@ ul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h your God said to you , ' You shall be she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of my people Israel , and you shall be pr@@ ince over my people Israel . ' "
David and all Israel went to Jer@@ usalem ( the same is Je@@ bus ) ; and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .
now these are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Israel .
this is the number of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : Jas@@ ho@@ be@@ am , the son of a H@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them at one time .
he was with David at Pas@@ dam@@ m@@ im , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of bar@@ ley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the three broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h ,
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more hon@@ or@@ able than the two , and was made their captain : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t at@@ tain to the three .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
now these are those who came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish ; and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , his hel@@ pers in war .
they were armed with bo@@ ws , and could use both the right hand and the left in s@@ l@@ inging stones and in shooting ar@@ ro@@ ws from the bo@@ w : they were of Sa@@ ul 's brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er ; then Jo@@ ash , the sons of Sh@@ em@@ a@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ ath@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ i@@ el , and P@@ ele@@ t , the sons of Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Ber@@ ac@@ ah , and J@@ eh@@ u the An@@ ath@@ o@@ th@@ ite ,
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ i@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el , and Johan@@ an , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad the G@@ eder@@ ath@@ ite ,
these of the sons of G@@ ad were cap@@ tains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flow@@ ed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , and Michael , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and Eli@@ hu , and Zil@@ le@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of thousands who were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
and Zad@@ ok , a young man m@@ igh@@ ty of val@@ or , and of his father 's house twenty @@@ -@@ @ two cap@@ tains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Sa@@ ul , three thousand : for hi@@ ther@@ to the greatest part of them had kept their alle@@ gi@@ ance to the house of Sa@@ ul .
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im twenty thousand eight hundred , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , famous men in their fa@@ thers ' houses .
of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their comman@@ d@@ ment .
of the Dani@@ tes who could set the battle in array , twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight thousand six hundred .
of As@@ her , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , for@@ ty thousand .
on the other side of the Jordan , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand .
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
they carried the Ar@@ k of God on a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b : and Uz@@ za and A@@ hi@@ o dro@@ ve the c@@ art .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ar@@ k ; and there he died before God .
so David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t move the Ar@@ k to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
David inqu@@ ired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
David assemb@@ led all Israel at Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to its place , which he had prepared for it .
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes . San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
for because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t carry it at first , Yah@@ we@@ h our God made broke out against us , because we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek him according to the ordin@@ ance . "
the children of the L@@ evi@@ tes b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of God on their sho@@ ul@@ ders with the po@@ les there@@ on , as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
David spoke to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding al@@ oud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his brothers , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their brothers , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so the singers , H@@ eman , A@@ sap@@ h , and E@@ than , were given cy@@ m@@ b@@ als of br@@ ass to sound al@@ oud ;
and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and Az@@ i@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , and Eli@@ a@@ b , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments set to Ala@@ mo@@ th ;
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ phe@@ leh@@ u , and Mik@@ ne@@ i@@ ah , and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and Je@@ i@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps tun@@ ed to the eight @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed Ly@@ re , to lead .
so David , and the el@@ ders of Israel , and the cap@@ tains over thousands , went to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom with joy .
David was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ro@@ be of fine lin@@ en , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k , and the singers , and Chen@@ an@@ i@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ep@@ ho@@ d of lin@@ en .
thus all Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with sound of the cor@@ net , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding al@@ oud with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and har@@ ps .
it happened , as the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h came to the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looked out at the window , and saw king David dan@@ cing and playing ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of God , and set it in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a portion of meat , and a c@@ ake of ra@@ is@@ ins .
A@@ sap@@ h the chief , and second to him Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , Je@@ i@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ a@@ b , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah , and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and Je@@ i@@ el , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and with har@@ ps ; and A@@ sap@@ h with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding al@@ oud ;
so he left there , before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , A@@ sap@@ h and his brothers , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required ;
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he comman@@ ded to Israel ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yah@@ we@@ h , because his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness en@@ du@@ res fore@@ ver ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un with tr@@ ump@@ ets and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als for those that should sound al@@ oud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un to be at the gate .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my ser@@ vant David , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " I took you from the she@@ ep p@@ en , from following the she@@ ep , that you should be pr@@ ince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you have gone , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fa@@ thers , that I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yah@@ we@@ h God .
when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David struck of the Syri@@ ans twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand men .
King David also dedicated these to Yah@@ we@@ h , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
it happened after this , that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
then there went certain persons , and told David how the men were served . he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly as@@ ha@@ med . the king said , " Sta@@ y at Jer@@ ich@@ o until your be@@ ards have grown , and then return . "
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they had made themselves odi@@ ous to David , Han@@ un and the children of Am@@ mon sent one thousand tal@@ ents of silver to h@@ ire them char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men out of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , and out of Ar@@ am@@ ma@@ ac@@ ah , and out of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah and his people , who came and en@@ camp@@ ed before M@@ ede@@ ba . the children of Am@@ mon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the gate of the city : and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
be cour@@ age@@ ous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yah@@ we@@ h do that which seems good to him . "
so Jo@@ a@@ b and the people who were with him drew near before the Syri@@ ans to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans who were beyond the River , with S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the army of Had@@ ade@@ zer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syri@@ ans , they fought with him .
David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
it happened after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ ai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite killed S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stat@@ ure , whose fin@@ gers and to@@ es were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four , six on each hand , and six on each fo@@ ot ; and he also was born to the giant .
these were born to the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew s@@ word : and in Ju@@ da@@ h were four hundred sev@@ enty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
David said to God , " I have sin@@ ned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I be@@ g you , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of your ser@@ vant ; for I have done very fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly . "
David said to G@@ ad , " I am in dist@@ ress . let me fall , I pra@@ y , into the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for his mer@@ cies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
then the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded G@@ ad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h there , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , and called on Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he answ@@ ered him from the sky by fire on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering .
at that time , when David saw that Yah@@ we@@ h had answ@@ ered him in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , then he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h , which Mos@@ es made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , were at that time in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in ab@@ und@@ ance for the n@@ ails for the doors of the gates , and for the cou@@ pl@@ ings ; and br@@ ass in ab@@ und@@ ance without weight ;
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yah@@ we@@ h my God .
but the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying , ' You have shed blood ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the ear@@ th in my sight .
May Yah@@ we@@ h give you discre@@ tion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
then you will prosp@@ er , if you observe to do the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces which Yah@@ we@@ h gave Mos@@ es concerning Israel . be strong , and cour@@ age@@ ous . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
now , be@@ hold , in my aff@@ li@@ ction I have prepared for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h one hundred thousand tal@@ ents of gold , one million tal@@ ents of silver , and br@@ ass and iron without weight ; for it is in ab@@ und@@ ance . I have also prepared tim@@ ber and stone ; and you may add to them .
there are also work@@ men with you in ab@@ und@@ ance , cut@@ ters and workers of stone and tim@@ ber , and all kinds of men who are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in every kind of work :
the L@@ evi@@ tes were num@@ ber@@ ed from thirty years old and up@@ ward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight thousand .
David said , " O@@ f these , twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand were to over@@ see the work of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
Jah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and Ber@@ i@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have many sons ; therefore they became a fa@@ thers ' house in one rec@@ kon@@ ing .
the sons of Am@@ ram : Aaron and Mos@@ es ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanc@@ ti@@ fy the most hol@@ y things , he and his sons , fore@@ ver , to bur@@ n incen@@ se before Yah@@ we@@ h , to minister to him , and to b@@ less in his name , fore@@ ver .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after their fa@@ thers ' houses , even the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , from twenty years old and up@@ ward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
and that they should keep the duty of the tent of Meet@@ ing , and the duty of the hol@@ y place , and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers , for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
David with Zad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , divided them according to their or@@ dering in their service .
there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen , heads of fa@@ thers ' houses ; and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , eight .
thus were they divided im@@ partially by drawing lots ; for there were pr@@ inces of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and pr@@ inces of God , both of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
this was their or@@ dering in their service , to come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h according to the ordin@@ ance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had comman@@ ded him .
of the Iz@@ har@@ ites , S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th ; of the sons of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th , Jah@@ ath .
the sons of Mus@@ hi : Mah@@ li , and E@@ der , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th . these were the sons of the L@@ evi@@ tes after their fa@@ thers ' houses .
moreover , David and the cap@@ tains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :
of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h : Z@@ acc@@ ur , and Joseph , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and As@@ har@@ e@@ lah , the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , under the hand of A@@ sap@@ h , who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied after the order of the king .
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and har@@ ps , for the service of God 's house ; A@@ sap@@ h , J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and H@@ eman being under the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instruc@@ ted in singing to Yah@@ we@@ h , even all who were s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful , was two hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
for the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers : of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , Mes@@ he@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of k@@ ore , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h .
also to Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons : Sh@@ im@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , for every gate .
these were the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers ; of the sons of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , and of the sons of Mer@@ ari .
of the L@@ evi@@ tes , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of L@@ adan , the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites belonging to L@@ adan , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households belonging to L@@ adan the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite : Je@@ hi@@ eli .
this S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the army , had dedicated .
all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated , who@@ ever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th , and of his brothers .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites , Has@@ habi@@ ah and his brothers , men of val@@ or , one thousand seven hundred , had the over@@ sight of Israel beyond the Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , for all the business of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the service of the king .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even of the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to their generations by fa@@ thers ' households . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , chief : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
this is that Ben@@ ai@@ ah , who was the m@@ igh@@ ty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Am@@ m@@ iz@@ ab@@ ad his son .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was H@@ ele@@ z the Pel@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
furthermore over the tri@@ bes of Israel : of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites was Eli@@ ez@@ er the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri the ru@@ ler : of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah :
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Hos@@ he@@ a the son of Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah : of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Jo@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah :
but David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yah@@ we@@ h had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t finish ; and there came wr@@ ath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chron@@ ic@@ les of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the tow@@ ers , was Jon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
over those who did the work of the field for til@@ la@@ ge of the ground was E@@ z@@ ri the son of C@@ hel@@ u@@ b :
and over the olive trees and the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that were in the low@@ land was Ba@@ al H@@ anan the G@@ eder@@ ite : and over the cel@@ lars of oil was Jo@@ ash :
and over the her@@ ds that f@@ ed in Shar@@ on was Sh@@ it@@ ra@@ i the Shar@@ on@@ ite : and over the her@@ ds that were in the val@@ ley@@ s was Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ad@@ la@@ i :
and over the ca@@ me@@ ls was O@@ bil the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elite : and over the don@@ ke@@ ys was J@@ eh@@ de@@ i@@ ah the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite : and over the f@@ loc@@ ks was Jaz@@ iz the Hag@@ r@@ ite .
also Jon@@ athan , David 's un@@ cle , was a coun@@ sel@@ or , a man of understanding , and a s@@ cri@@ be : and Je@@ hi@@ el the son of H@@ ach@@ mon@@ i was with the king 's sons :
of all my sons ( for Yah@@ we@@ h has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Yah@@ we@@ h 's k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le , and of its houses , and of its treas@@ ur@@ ies , and of the up@@ per rooms of it , and of the in@@ ner rooms of it , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ;
and the pat@@ tern of all that he had by the Spiri@@ t , for the courts of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all the surrounding rooms , for the treas@@ ur@@ ies of God 's house , and for the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the dedicated things ;

of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
by weight also for the lam@@ p@@ stands of gold , and for its lam@@ ps , of gold , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps ; and for the lam@@ p@@ stands of silver , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps , according to the use of every lam@@ p@@ stand ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the for@@ ks , and the bas@@ ins , and the c@@ ups , of p@@ ure gold ; and for the golden bo@@ w@@ ls by weight for every bo@@ w@@ l ; and for the silver bo@@ w@@ ls by weight for every bo@@ w@@ l ;
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot , the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , that spread out , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h .
in addition , because I have set my aff@@ ection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
even three thousand tal@@ ents of gold , of the gold of Op@@ hir , and seven thousand tal@@ ents of refin@@ ed silver , with which to over@@ lay the walls of the houses ;
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of ar@@ tis@@ ans . who then offers will@@ ingly to consec@@ rate himself this day to Yah@@ we@@ h ? "
then the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households , and the pr@@ inces of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rul@@ ers over the king 's work , offered will@@ ingly ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand tal@@ ents and ten thousand dar@@ ics , and of silver ten thousand tal@@ ents , and of br@@ ass E@@ igh@@ teen thousand tal@@ ents , and of iron a hundred thousand tal@@ ents .
they with whom pre@@ ci@@ ous stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , under the hand of Je@@ hi@@ el the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite .
then the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , because they offered will@@ ingly , because with a perfect heart they offered will@@ ingly to Yah@@ we@@ h : and David the king also re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy .
yo@@ urs , Yah@@ we@@ h , is the gre@@ at@@ ness , the power , the gl@@ ory , the victory , and the maj@@ es@@ ty ! for all that is in the heav@@ ens and in the ear@@ th is yo@@ urs . yo@@ urs is the k@@ ing@@ dom , Yah@@ we@@ h , and you are ex@@ al@@ ted as head above all .
both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so will@@ ingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
for we are st@@ ran@@ gers before you , and foreigners , as all our fa@@ thers were . our days on the ear@@ th are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yah@@ we@@ h our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your hol@@ y name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , of I@@ sa@@ ac , and of Israel , our fa@@ thers , keep this fore@@ ver in the imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ;
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your comman@@ d@@ ments , your testimon@@ ies , and your stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es to Yah@@ we@@ h , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bul@@ ls , one thousand r@@ ams , and one thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance for all Israel ,
Yah@@ we@@ h mag@@ ni@@ fied Solomon exce@@ ed@@ ingly in the sight of all Israel , and bes@@ to@@ wed on him such royal maj@@ es@@ ty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
the time that he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel was for@@ ty years ; he re@@ ig@@ ned seven years in He@@ br@@ on , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years in Jer@@ usalem .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the history of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every pr@@ ince in all Israel , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tent of Meet@@ ing of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but David had brought the Ar@@ k of God up from Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the bronze alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , was there before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking coun@@ sel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze alt@@ ar before Yah@@ we@@ h , which was at the tent of Meet@@ ing , and offered one thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it .
now , Yah@@ we@@ h God , let your promise to David my father be established ; for you have made me king over a people like the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in multi@@ tude .
now give me wis@@ dom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on , from before the tent of Meet@@ ing , to Jer@@ usalem ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
Solomon sent to Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re , saying , " As you dealt with David my father , and sent him c@@ ed@@ ars to build him a house in which to d@@ well , so deal with me .
" send me also c@@ ed@@ ar trees , f@@ ir trees , and al@@ gu@@ m trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut tim@@ ber in Lebanon : and be@@ hold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
be@@ hold , I will give to your servants , the cut@@ ters who cut tim@@ ber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of bar@@ ley , and twenty thousand ba@@ ths of wine , and twenty thousand ba@@ ths of oil . "
" now therefore the wheat and the bar@@ ley , the oil and the wine , which my lor@@ d has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and you shall carry it up to Jer@@ usalem . "
Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing with which David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found one hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ three thousand six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem on Mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the por@@ ch that was in front , its length , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight one hundred twenty ; and he over@@ laid it within with p@@ ure gold .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the th@@ res@@ holds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and en@@ gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m on the walls .
he made the most hol@@ y house : its length , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred tal@@ ents .
the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : the wing of the one was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , joining to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
the w@@ ings of these ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m spread themselves forth twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
also he made before the house two pil@@ lars of thirty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he made cha@@ ins in the or@@ acle , and put them on the tops of the pil@@ lars ; and he made one hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
he set up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
also he made the m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass ; and its he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it .
under it was the lik@@ eness of ox@@ en , which en@@ circ@@ led it , for ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , en@@ cir@@ cling the sea . the ox@@ en were in two ro@@ ws , cast when it was cast .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
it was a hand@@ b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick ; and its bri@@ m was worked like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , like the f@@ lower of a L@@ ily : it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
he made the ten lam@@ p@@ stands of gold according to the ordin@@ ance concerning them ; and he set them in the temp@@ le , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred bas@@ ins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid their doors with br@@ ass .
Hur@@ am made the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins . so Hur@@ am made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
the two pil@@ lars , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pil@@ lars , and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ,
and the four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pil@@ lars .
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors of it for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the main hall of the temp@@ le were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; these the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led to him , were before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h to its place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k except the two tables which Mos@@ es put at Ho@@ re@@ b , when Yah@@ we@@ h made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
it happened , when the pri@@ ests had come out of the hol@@ y place , ( for all the pri@@ ests who were present had sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t keep their divisions ;
the king turned his face , and b@@ les@@ sed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his m@@ outh to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
but Yah@@ we@@ h said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
" Yah@@ we@@ h has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
there I have set the Ar@@ k , in which is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he made with the children of Israel . "
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant shall pra@@ y toward this place .
listen to the peti@@ tions of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place : yes , hear from your d@@ wel@@ ling place , even from heav@@ en ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
" if a man sin against his neigh@@ bor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swe@@ ar , and he comes and swe@@ ars before your alt@@ ar in this house ;
then hear from heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , bringing re@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
" if your people Israel be struck down before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against you , and shall turn again and conf@@ ess your name , and pra@@ y and make supp@@ lic@@ ation before you in this house ;
then hear from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ lic@@ t them :
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
" if there is fam@@ ine in the land , if there is p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , if there is b@@ light or mil@@ dew , loc@@ ust or cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lar ; if their enem@@ ies bes@@ i@@ ege them in the land of their cities ; whatever pla@@ gue or whatever si@@ ck@@ ness there is ;
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own pla@@ gue and his own sor@@ row , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear from heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place and for@@ give , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of the children of men ; )
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fa@@ thers .
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; when they shall come and pra@@ y toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enem@@ ies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall rep@@ ent themselves in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , we have done per@@ ver@@ sely , and have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , where they have carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
then hear from heav@@ en , even from your d@@ wel@@ ling place , their pray@@ er and their peti@@ tions , and maintain their cause , and for@@ give your people who have sin@@ ned against you .
" now , my God , let , I be@@ g you , your eyes be open , and let your e@@ ars be atten@@ tive , to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
" now therefore arise , Yah@@ we@@ h God , into your resting place , you , and the Ar@@ k of your strength : let your pri@@ ests , Yah@@ we@@ h God , be clo@@ th@@ ed with sal@@ vation , and let your sa@@ ints re@@ jo@@ ice in Go@@ od@@ ness .
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
the pri@@ ests could not enter into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , because the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand head of c@@ attle , and a hundred and twenty thousand she@@ ep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
on the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their ten@@ ts , jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart for the Go@@ od@@ ness that Yah@@ we@@ h had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in his own house .
Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
if my people , who are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom , according as I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ru@@ ler in Israel . '
but if you turn away , and for@@ sake my stat@@ utes and my comman@@ d@@ ments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and his own house ,
that the cities which Hur@@ am had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to d@@ well there .
also he built Beth Hor@@ on the up@@ per , and Beth Hor@@ on the lower , for@@ ti@@ fied cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and all that Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people who were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consum@@ e , of them Solomon cons@@ crip@@ ted forced la@@ bor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , three times in the year , in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of ten@@ ts .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and until it was finished . so the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was completed .
Hur@@ am sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Op@@ hir , and f@@ et@@ ched from there four hundred fif@@ ty tal@@ ents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wis@@ dom .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and be@@ hold , the half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of your wis@@ dom was not told me : you exceed the f@@ ame that I heard .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty tal@@ ents of gold , and sp@@ ices in great ab@@ und@@ ance , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : neither was there any such sp@@ ice as the qu@@ een of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
King Solomon gave to the qu@@ een of She@@ ba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six tal@@ ents of gold ,
and there were six steps to the th@@ r@@ one , with a foot@@ st@@ ool of gold , which were fas@@ tened to the th@@ r@@ one , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons standing bes@@ ide the stays .
twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tar@@ sh@@ ish with the servants of Hur@@ am ; once every three years came the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish , bringing gold , and silver , Iv@@ ory , and ap@@ es , and peac@@ oc@@ ks .
all the kings of the ear@@ th sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wis@@ dom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tri@@ bute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clo@@ thing , arm@@ or , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and he made c@@ ed@@ ars to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er concerning Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
they sent and called him ; and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel came , and they spoke to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
" your father made our yok@@ e gri@@ ev@@ ous : now therefore make you the gri@@ ev@@ ous service of your father , and his heavy yok@@ e which he put on us , ligh@@ ter , and we will serve you . "
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took coun@@ sel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What coun@@ sel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
so the king di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Yah@@ we@@ h might establish his word , which he spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get himself up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jer@@ usalem , he assemb@@ led the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , one hundred eigh@@ ty thousand chosen men , who were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , to bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not exec@@ ute the pri@@ est 's office to Yah@@ we@@ h ;
and he appointed him pri@@ ests for the high places , and for the male go@@ ats , and for the cal@@ ves which he had made .
after them , out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , such as set their hear@@ ts to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , came to Jer@@ usalem to sacrifice to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers .
so they strengthened the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon strong , three years ; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon .
he dealt wis@@ ely , and disper@@ sed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , to every for@@ ti@@ fied city : and he gave them food in ab@@ und@@ ance . he sought for them many wi@@ ves .
it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was established , and he was strong , that he for@@ so@@ ok the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all Israel with him .
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the guard came and b@@ ore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , first and last , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the histor@@ ies of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t and of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er , after the way of gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies ? there were wars between Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am continu@@ ally .
he re@@ ig@@ ned three years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mic@@ ai@@ ah the daughter of U@@ ri@@ el of Gi@@ be@@ ah . there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
ought you not to know that Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David fore@@ ver , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
" now you think to with@@ stand the k@@ ing@@ dom of Yah@@ we@@ h in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multi@@ tude , and there are with you the golden cal@@ ves which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am made you for go@@ ds .
" but as for us , Yah@@ we@@ h is our God , and we have not for@@ sak@@ en him ; and we have pri@@ ests minist@@ ering to Yah@@ we@@ h , the sons of Aaron , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their work :
be@@ hold , God is with us at our head , and his pri@@ ests with the tr@@ ump@@ ets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don '@@ t fight against Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers ; for you shall not prosp@@ er . "
when Ju@@ da@@ h looked back , be@@ hold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and the pri@@ ests so@@ unded with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it happened , that God struck Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h prev@@ ailed , because they reli@@ ed on Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers .
A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah pursu@@ ed after Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and took cities from him , Be@@ the@@ l with its towns , and J@@ es@@ han@@ ah with its towns , and E@@ ph@@ ron with its towns .
there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred char@@ i@@ ots ; and he came to Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h .
A@@ SA and the people who were with him pursu@@ ed them to Ger@@ ar : and there fell of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians so many that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yah@@ we@@ h , and before his army ; and they carried away very much bo@@ o@@ ty .
but when in their dist@@ ress they turned to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troub@@ les were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
so they gathered themselves together at Jer@@ usalem in the third month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of A@@ SA .
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h in that day , of the sp@@ oil which they had brought , seven hundred head of c@@ attle and seven thousand she@@ ep .
they entered into the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l ;
and that who@@ ever would not seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around .
also Ma@@ ac@@ ah , the mother of A@@ SA the king , he removed from being qu@@ een , because she had made an ab@@ omin@@ able image for an Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ SA cut down her image , and made d@@ ust of it , and bur@@ n@@ t it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of A@@ SA , Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel went up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
then A@@ SA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Had@@ ad king of Syria , who lived at Dam@@ as@@ cus , saying ,
it happened , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and let his work ce@@ ase .
then A@@ SA the king took all Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and its tim@@ ber , with which Ba@@ as@@ ha had built ; and he built there@@ with Ge@@ ba and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said to him , " Bec@@ ause you have reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and have not reli@@ ed on Yah@@ we@@ h your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
for the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h run back and forth throughout the whole ear@@ th , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in you have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly ; for from hen@@ ce@@ forth you shall have wars . "
then A@@ SA was angry with the se@@ er , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people at the same time .
be@@ hold , the acts of A@@ SA , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ ninth year of his reign A@@ SA was dis@@ eased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h , but to the physi@@ cians .
he placed forces in all the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yah@@ we@@ h : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Ash@@ er@@ im out of Ju@@ da@@ h .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his pr@@ inces , even Ben ha@@ il , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and Mic@@ ai@@ ah , to te@@ ach in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and with them the L@@ evi@@ tes , even Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Z@@ eb@@ adi@@ ah , and A@@ sah@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan , and Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , and To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and Tob@@ ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , the L@@ evi@@ tes ; and with them E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am , the pri@@ ests .
they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , having the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught among the people .
the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h fell on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the lands that were around Ju@@ da@@ h , so that they made no war against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at .
he had many works in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and men of war , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , in Jer@@ usalem .
this was the num@@ ber@@ ing of them according to their fa@@ thers ' houses : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
and next to him A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
after certain years he went down to A@@ ha@@ b to Samar@@ ia . A@@ ha@@ b killed she@@ ep and c@@ attle for him in ab@@ und@@ ance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
now the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , ar@@ ray@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets were pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying before them .
Yah@@ we@@ h said , ' Wh@@ o shall enti@@ ce A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
" he said , ' I will go forth , and will be a lying spirit in the m@@ outh of all his pro@@ ph@@ ets . ' " he said , ' You will enti@@ ce him , and will prev@@ ail also . go forth , and do so . '
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and struck Mic@@ ai@@ ah on the che@@ ek , and said , " Wh@@ ich way did the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h go from me to speak to you ? "
and say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and fe@@ ed him with bread of aff@@ li@@ ction and with water of aff@@ li@@ ction , until I return in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and Yah@@ we@@ h helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bo@@ w at ran@@ dom , and struck the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the arm@@ or . therefore he said to the driver of the char@@ i@@ ot , " Tur@@ n your hand , and carry me out of the army ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel pro@@ pped himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani the se@@ er went out to meet him , and said to king J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " Sho@@ uld you help the w@@ ic@@ ked , and love those who h@@ ate Yah@@ we@@ h ? because of this , wr@@ ath is on you from before Yah@@ we@@ h .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at lived at Jer@@ usalem : and he went out again among the people from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and brought them back to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers .
now therefore let the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h be on you . take heed and do it : for there is no in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity with Yah@@ we@@ h our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of bribes . "
moreover in Jer@@ usalem J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at appointed L@@ evi@@ tes and pri@@ ests , and of the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for controversi@@ es . they returned to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened after this , that the children of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon , and with them some of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , came against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at to battle .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the Lev@@ ite , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , in the mid@@ st of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . be@@ hold , they are coming up by the as@@ cent of Z@@ iz . you shall find them at the end of the val@@ ley , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites and of the children of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with an exceeding l@@ oud voice .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ a@@ b stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Se@@ ir , ut@@ ter@@ ly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Ju@@ da@@ h came to the place over@@ looking the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they looked at the multi@@ tude ; and be@@ hold , they were dead bodies fallen to the ear@@ th , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore the name of that place was called The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in their fo@@ ref@@ ront , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for Yah@@ we@@ h had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
the fear of God was on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the countries , when they heard that Yah@@ we@@ h fought against the enem@@ ies of Israel .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
he walked in the way of A@@ SA his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hear@@ ts to the God of their fa@@ thers .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the history of J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani , which is in@@ ser@@ ted in the book of the kings of Israel .
he had brothers , the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Michael , and She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah ; all these were the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up over the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the s@@ word , and various also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
however Yah@@ we@@ h would not destroy the house of David , because of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lam@@ p to him and to his children always .
then J@@ eh@@ or@@ am passed over with his cap@@ tains , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , along with the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots .
so E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h to this day : then Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ ted at the same time from under his hand , because he had for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fa@@ thers .
a letter came to him from Eli@@ j@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , ' Bec@@ ause you have not walked in the ways of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at your father , nor in the ways of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h ,
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem to play the pro@@ stitute , like the house of A@@ ha@@ b did , and also have sla@@ in your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yo@@ ur@@ self :
and they came up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and broke into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , except Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
thirty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem eight years : and he depar@@ ted without being desi@@ red ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tom@@ bs of the kings .
the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem made A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Ara@@ bi@@ ans to the camp had sla@@ in all the el@@ dest . so A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ ig@@ ned .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for they were his coun@@ sel@@ ors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment on the house of A@@ ha@@ b , that he found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the brothers of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , minist@@ ering to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , and killed them .
now when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she ar@@ ose and destroyed all the royal se@@ ed of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
all the assembly made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the sons of David .
this is the thing that you shall do . a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the th@@ res@@ holds .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , except the pri@@ ests , and those who minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes . they shall come in , for they are hol@@ y , but all the people shall follow Yah@@ we@@ h 's instruc@@ tions .
the L@@ evi@@ tes shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . who@@ ever comes into the house , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dismiss the shift .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds the spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the hor@@ se gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down , and broke his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came through the up@@ per gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Zi@@ bi@@ ah , of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h to the Ba@@ als .
so the king comman@@ ded , and they made a ch@@ est , and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
all the pr@@ inces and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and brought in , and cast into the ch@@ est , until they had made an end .
the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to restore the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and also such as worked iron and br@@ ass to repair the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
so the work@@ men worked , and the work of rep@@ air@@ ing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada came the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to the king . then the king list@@ ened to them .
they for@@ so@@ ok the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , and served the Ash@@ er@@ im and the id@@ ols : and wr@@ ath came on Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for this their guil@@ tin@@ ess .
thus Jo@@ ash the king di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember the kin@@ d@@ ness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yah@@ we@@ h look at it , and repay it . "
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syri@@ ans came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all their sp@@ oil to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan , of Jer@@ usalem .
now it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , the army that had come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : therefore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in fierce an@@ ger .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Sal@@ t , and struck ten thousand of the children of Se@@ ir .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se to them .
therefore the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , and he sent to him a pro@@ phe@@ t , who said to him , " Wh@@ y have you sought after the go@@ ds of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h consul@@ ted his advisers , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of J@@ eh@@ u , king of Israel , saying , " C@@ ome , let us look one another in the face . "
you say to yo@@ ur@@ self that you have struck E@@ dom ; and your heart lif@@ ts you up to bo@@ ast . now stay at home . why should you med@@ dle with trouble , that you should fall , even you , and Ju@@ da@@ h with you ? ' "
so Jo@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h .
Jo@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Jo@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in God 's house with Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the host@@ ages also , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , first and last , be@@ hold , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel ?
now from the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah turned away from following Yah@@ we@@ h , they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem . he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and killed him there .
all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took Uz@@ zi@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the place of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
six@@ teen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ech@@ ili@@ ah , of Jer@@ usalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yah@@ we@@ h , God made him to prosp@@ er .
he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and broke down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d ; and he built cities in the country of Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built tow@@ ers in Jer@@ usalem at the cor@@ ner gate , and at the val@@ ley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and for@@ ti@@ fied them .
the whole number of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , even the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with m@@ igh@@ ty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah prepared for them , even for all the army , shi@@ elds , and spe@@ ars , and hel@@ me@@ ts , and co@@ ats of mail , and bo@@ ws , and stones for s@@ l@@ inging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did cor@@ rup@@ tly , and he t@@ res@@ passed against Yah@@ we@@ h his God ; for he went into Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le to bur@@ n incen@@ se on the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the chief pri@@ est , and all the pri@@ ests , looked on him , and be@@ hold , he was le@@ pro@@ us in his fore@@ head , and they th@@ rust him out quickly from there ; yes , himself hur@@ ried also to go out , because Yah@@ we@@ h had struck him .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the field of bur@@ ial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a le@@ per . " Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha@@ h the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le . the people still did cor@@ rup@@ tly .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , like David his father ;
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
Z@@ ic@@ hri , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , killed Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the king 's son , and Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am the ru@@ ler of the house , and El@@ kan@@ ah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for bon@@ d@@ servants and bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids for yo@@ ur@@ selves . A@@ ren '@@ t there even with you t@@ res@@ passes of your own against Yah@@ we@@ h your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the cap@@ tives , that you have taken cap@@ tive from your brothers ; for the fierce wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h is on you . "
then some of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against those who came from the war ,
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines also had inv@@ aded the cities of the low@@ land , and of the South of Ju@@ da@@ h , and had taken Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and G@@ eder@@ o@@ th , and So@@ co with its towns , and Tim@@ n@@ ah with its towns , G@@ imz@@ o also and its towns : and they lived there .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and out of the house of the king and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t help him .
A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
in every city of Ju@@ da@@ h he made high places to bur@@ n incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and provoked to an@@ ger Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fa@@ thers .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bring him into the tom@@ bs of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and rep@@ aired them .
he brought in the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of Yah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the por@@ ch , and put out the lam@@ ps , and have not burned incen@@ se nor offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings in the hol@@ y place to the God of Israel .
now it is in my heart to make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that his fierce an@@ ger may turn away from us .
my sons , don '@@ t be neg@@ lig@@ ent now ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and bur@@ n incen@@ se . "
the pri@@ ests went in to the in@@ ner part of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le into the court of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in eight days : and on the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleans@@ ed all the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign threw away when he t@@ res@@ passed , have we prepared and sanc@@ ti@@ fied ; and be@@ hold , they are before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so they killed the bul@@ ls , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : and they killed the r@@ ams , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering on the alt@@ ar . when the bur@@ n@@ t offering began , the song of Yah@@ we@@ h began also , and the tr@@ ump@@ ets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bo@@ wed themselves and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing pra@@ ises to Yah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
also the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings were in ab@@ und@@ ance , with the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , and with the drink offer@@ ings for every bur@@ n@@ t offering . so the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was set in order .
for the king had taken coun@@ sel , and his pr@@ inces , and all the assembly in Jer@@ usalem , to keep the P@@ ass@@ over in the second month .
D@@ on '@@ t be like your fa@@ thers , and like your brothers , who t@@ res@@ passed against Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , so that he gave them up to de@@ so@@ lation , as you see .
they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the P@@ ass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Mos@@ es the man of God : the pri@@ ests sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood which they received of the hand of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes were in charge of killing the P@@ ass@@ overs for everyone who was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them to Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel who were present at Jer@@ usalem kept the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days with great gla@@ d@@ ness ; and the L@@ evi@@ tes and the pri@@ ests praised Yah@@ we@@ h day by day , singing with l@@ oud instruments to Yah@@ we@@ h .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h gave to the assembly for offer@@ ings one thousand bul@@ ls and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the assembly a thousand bul@@ ls and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
all the assembly of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h .
moreover he comman@@ ded the people who lived in Jer@@ usalem to give the portion of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , that they might give themselves to the law of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , who lived in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of c@@ attle and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of dedicated things which were consec@@ rated to Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the he@@ aps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and this fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came , and entered into Ju@@ da@@ h , and en@@ camp@@ ed against the for@@ ti@@ fied cities , and thought to win them for himself .
when H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah saw that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b had come , and that he was pur@@ posed to fight against Jer@@ usalem ,
he took coun@@ sel with his pr@@ inces and his m@@ igh@@ ty men to stop the waters of the spr@@ ings which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the spr@@ ings , and the Bro@@ ok that flow@@ ed through the mid@@ st of the land , saying , " Wh@@ y should the kings of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a come , and find much water ? "
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
" be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous , don '@@ t be afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , nor for all the multi@@ tude who is with him ; for there is a greater with us than with him .
with him is an arm of f@@ les@@ h ; but with us is Yah@@ we@@ h our God to help us , and to fight our batt@@ les . " the people rested themselves on the words of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
after this , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( now he was before L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him ) , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all Ju@@ da@@ h who were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , to give you over to die by fam@@ ine and by thir@@ st , saying , ' Yah@@ we@@ h our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ? '
D@@ on '@@ t you know what I and my fa@@ thers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations which my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jer@@ usalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jer@@ usalem , as of the go@@ ds of the peoples of the ear@@ th , which are the work of men 's hands .
thus Yah@@ we@@ h sav@@ ed H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and from the hand of all others , and gui@@ ded them on every side .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and hon@@ or : and he provided him treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all kinds of good@@ ly vessels ;
this same H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah also stopped the up@@ per spring of the waters of G@@ ih@@ on , and brought them stra@@ ight down on the west side of the city of David . H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah prosp@@ ered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z , in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the as@@ cent of the tom@@ bs of the sons of David : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did him hon@@ or at his death . Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had broken down ; and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for the Ba@@ als , and made Ash@@ ero@@ th , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m ; and he prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
he pray@@ ed to him ; and he was ent@@ re@@ ated by him , and heard his supp@@ lic@@ ation , and brought him again to Jer@@ usalem into his k@@ ing@@ dom . then Man@@ as@@ se@@ h knew that Yah@@ we@@ h was God .
he took away the foreign go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers who spoke to him in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his pray@@ er also , and how God was ent@@ re@@ ated of him , and all his sin and his t@@ res@@ pass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Ash@@ er@@ im and the en@@ gra@@ ved images , before he hum@@ b@@ led himself : be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Ho@@ zai .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father ; and Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to all the en@@ gra@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them .
he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hum@@ ble himself before Yah@@ we@@ h , as Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had hum@@ b@@ led himself ; but this same Am@@ on t@@ res@@ passed more and more .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the work@@ men who la@@ bo@@ red in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h given by Mos@@ es .
Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
they have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and into the hand of the work@@ men . "
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they whom the king had comman@@ ded , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Tok@@ hat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wr@@ ath p@@ oured out on this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' " '
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : " as tou@@ ching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves after your fa@@ thers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fa@@ thers ' house of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and young go@@ ats , all of them for the P@@ ass@@ over offer@@ ings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ ls : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
Con@@ an@@ i@@ ah also , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , his brothers , and Has@@ habi@@ ah and Je@@ i@@ el and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , the chiefs of the L@@ evi@@ tes , gave to the L@@ evi@@ tes for the P@@ ass@@ over offer@@ ings five thousand small li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and five hundred head of c@@ attle .
so the service was prepared , and the pri@@ ests stood in their place , and the L@@ evi@@ tes by their divisions , according to the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yah@@ we@@ h , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . so they did with the c@@ attle .
they ro@@ asted the P@@ ass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the hol@@ y offer@@ ings bo@@ iled they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yah@@ we@@ h was prepared the same day , to keep the P@@ ass@@ over , and to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of king Jos@@ i@@ ah .
so his servants took him out of the char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tom@@ bs of his fa@@ thers . all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
Jerem@@ i@@ ah lamen@@ ted for Jos@@ i@@ ah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Jos@@ i@@ ah in their lament@@ ations to this day ; and they made them an ordin@@ ance in Israel : and be@@ hold , they are written in the lament@@ ations .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , according to that which is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
and his acts , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
then the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jer@@ usalem .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h his God .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put them in his temp@@ le at Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months and ten days in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
at the return of the year king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h his God ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hum@@ ble himself before Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t speaking from the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart against turning to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , and the people , t@@ res@@ passed very greatly after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations ; and they pollu@@ ted the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which he had made hol@@ y in Jer@@ usalem .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up early and sending , because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
but they mo@@ cked the mes@@ sen@@ gers of God , and desp@@ ised his words , and sco@@ ff@@ ed at his pro@@ ph@@ ets , until the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h ar@@ ose against his people , until there was no re@@ medy .
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces , all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
they bur@@ n@@ t God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem , and bur@@ n@@ t all its pal@@ aces with fire , and destroyed all the good@@ ly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the s@@ word away to Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia :
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
" thus says Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en , has given me all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th ; and he has comman@@ ded me to build him a house in Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h .
who@@ ever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jer@@ usalem .
then the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , and the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , even all whose spirit God had s@@ tir@@ red to go up rose up to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , besides all that was will@@ ingly offered .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ three .
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of H@@ ass@@ op@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ uda ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth Haz@@ z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of A@@ mi .
these were those who went up from Tel Me@@ lah , Tel Har@@ s@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer ; but they could not show their fa@@ thers ' houses , and their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two .
of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed pollu@@ ted and put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , until there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and with Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , when they came to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem , offered will@@ ingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the alt@@ ar on its base ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it to Yah@@ we@@ h , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of ten@@ ts , as it is written , and offered the daily bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings by number , according to the ordin@@ ance , as the duty of every day required ;
and after@@ ward the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , the offer@@ ings of the new mo@@ ons , of all the set fe@@ asts of Yah@@ we@@ h that were consec@@ rated , and of everyone who will@@ ingly offered a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h ; but the foundation of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le was not yet laid .
then J@@ es@@ hua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to have the over@@ sight of the work@@ men in God 's house : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and heads of fa@@ thers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice . many also sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy ,
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people ; for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard far away .
now when the ad@@ vers@@ aries of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin heard that the children of the cap@@ tivity were building a temp@@ le to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ;
and hired coun@@ sel@@ ors against them , to fru@@ str@@ ate their purpose , all the days of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , even until the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us king of Per@@ sia .
in the days of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es wrote B@@ ish@@ lam , Mi@@ th@@ red@@ ath , T@@ ab@@ e@@ el , and the rest of his compan@@ ions , to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Per@@ sia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian , and set forth in the Syrian language .
then Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and the rest of their compan@@ ions , the Din@@ ai@@ tes , and the Ap@@ har@@ sa@@ th@@ chi@@ tes , the Tar@@ p@@ eli@@ tes , the Ap@@ har@@ sites , the Arch@@ evi@@ tes , the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians , the Sh@@ us@@ han@@ chi@@ tes , the De@@ ha@@ ites , the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble Os@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the city of Samar@@ ia , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , and in the end it will be hur@@ t@@ ful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dis@@ hon@@ or , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
then the king sent an answer to Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and to Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and to the rest of their compan@@ ions who d@@ well in Samar@@ ia , and in the rest of the country beyond the River : peace , and so forth .
I decre@@ ed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
there have been m@@ igh@@ ty kings also over Jer@@ usalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , and toll , was paid to them .
then when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
now the pro@@ ph@@ ets , Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of I@@ d@@ do , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to the Jews who were in Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to them .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jer@@ usalem ; and with them were the pro@@ ph@@ ets of God , helping them .
then we told them in this way , what the names of the men were who were making this building .
but the eye of their God was on the el@@ ders of the Jews , and they did not make them ce@@ ase , until the matter should come to Dar@@ i@@ us , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the cop@@ y of the letter that T@@ atten@@ ai , the governor beyond the River , and She@@ th@@ ar@@ boz@@ en@@ ai , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , who were beyond the River , sent to Dar@@ i@@ us the king ;
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those Cy@@ ru@@ s the king took out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
and he said to him , ' T@@ ake these vessels , go , put them in the temp@@ le that is in Jer@@ usalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archi@@ ves , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a s@@ cr@@ oll , and there@@ in was thus written for a record :
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the el@@ ders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
also I have made a decree , that who@@ ever shall al@@ ter this word , let a be@@ am be pulled out from his house , and let him be lifted up and fas@@ tened there@@ on ; and let his house be made a d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill for this :
this house was finished on the third day of the month Ad@@ ar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the king .
the children of Israel , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedic@@ ation of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedic@@ ation of this house of God one hundred bul@@ ls , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male go@@ ats , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of Israel .
they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes had pur@@ ified themselves together ; all of them were p@@ ure : and they killed the P@@ ass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brothers the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for E@@ z@@ ra had set his heart to seek the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even the s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel :
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , who are min@@ ded of their own free will to go to Jer@@ usalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven coun@@ sel@@ ors , to inqu@@ ire concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his coun@@ sel@@ ors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habi@@ tation is in Jer@@ usalem ,
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
therefore you shall with all dil@@ ig@@ ence buy with this money bul@@ ls , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their me@@ al offer@@ ings and their drink offer@@ ings , and shall offer them on the alt@@ ar of the house of your God which is in Jer@@ usalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jer@@ usalem .
whatever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
to one hundred tal@@ ents of silver , and to one hundred measures of wheat , and to one hundred ba@@ ths of wine , and to one hundred ba@@ ths of oil , and salt without pres@@ cri@@ bing how much .
whatever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heav@@ en ; for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that tou@@ ching any of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , the singers , por@@ ters , N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be law@@ ful to impose tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , on them .
who@@ ever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all dil@@ ig@@ ence , whether it be to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fa@@ thers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
now these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of those who went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king :
of the sons of Ph@@ ine@@ has , Ger@@ sho@@ m . of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , Daniel . of the sons of David , H@@ att@@ ush .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of Par@@ os@@ h , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah ; and with him were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of the mal@@ es one hundred fif@@ ty .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el ; and with him three hundred mal@@ es .
of the sons of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , the son of Josip@@ hi@@ ah ; and with him one hundred six@@ ty mal@@ es .
of the sons of Ad@@ on@@ ik@@ am , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eli@@ phe@@ let , Je@@ uel , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah ; and with them six@@ ty mal@@ es .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to A@@ hava ; and there we en@@ camp@@ ed three days : and I viewed the people , and the pri@@ ests , and found there none of the sons of L@@ evi .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , who were teachers .
and of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , whom David and the pr@@ inces had given for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , two hundred and twenty N@@ eth@@ in@@ im : all of them were mentioned by name .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors , and his pr@@ inces , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch , and keep them , until you we@@ igh them before the chiefs of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the rooms of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem to the house of our God .
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves and for their sons , so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers has been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass . "
when I heard this thing , I t@@ ore my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down con@@ founded .
then were assemb@@ led to me everyone who tre@@ m@@ b@@ led at the words of the God of Israel , because of their t@@ res@@ pass of the cap@@ tivity ; and I sat con@@ founded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I ar@@ ose up from my hum@@ iliation , even with my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be torn ; and I fell on my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands to Yah@@ we@@ h my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ tin@@ ess has grown up to the heav@@ ens .
Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of E@@ lam , answ@@ ered E@@ z@@ ra , " We have t@@ res@@ passed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
then E@@ z@@ ra ar@@ ose , and made the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all Israel , to swe@@ ar that they would do according to this word . so they s@@ wor@@ e .
then E@@ z@@ ra rose up from before God 's house , and went into the room of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b : and when he came there , he ate no bread , nor d@@ rank water ; for he mour@@ ned because of their t@@ res@@ pass of the cap@@ tivity .
they made proc@@ lamation throughout Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem to all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jer@@ usalem ;
and that who@@ ever di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come within three days , according to the coun@@ sel of the pr@@ inces and the el@@ ders , all his sub@@ stance should be for@@ fe@@ ited , and himself separated from the assembly of the cap@@ tivity .
now therefore make conf@@ ession to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , and do his pleas@@ ure ; and separate yo@@ ur@@ selves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
the children of the cap@@ tivity did so . E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , with certain heads of fa@@ thers ' households , after their fa@@ thers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua , the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his brothers , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
the words of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Hac@@ ali@@ ah . now it happened in the month Ch@@ is@@ lev , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year , as I was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
that Han@@ ani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
they said to me , " The re@@ mn@@ ant who are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great aff@@ li@@ ction and re@@ pro@@ ach . the wall of Jer@@ usalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days ; and I fas@@ ted and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
and said , " I be@@ g you , Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en , the great and aw@@ es@@ ome God , who keeps C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness with those who love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments :
we have dealt very cor@@ rup@@ tly against you , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ments , nor the stat@@ utes , nor the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which you comman@@ ded your ser@@ vant Mos@@ es .
" remember , I be@@ g you , the word that you comman@@ ded your ser@@ vant Mos@@ es , saying , ' If you t@@ res@@ pass , I will sc@@ at@@ ter you abroad among the peoples ;
but if you return to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and do them , though your out@@ casts were in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ ens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to d@@ well there . '
it happened in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live fore@@ ver ! why sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fa@@ thers ' tom@@ bs , lies waste , and its gates have been consu@@ med with fire ? "
moreover I said to the king , " If it ple@@ ases the king , let letters be given me to the govern@@ ors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Ju@@ da@@ h ;
then I came to the govern@@ ors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ se@@ men .
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jer@@ usalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I ro@@ de on .
I went out by night by the val@@ ley gate , even toward the Jack@@ al 's well , and to the D@@ ung gate , and viewed the walls of Jer@@ usalem , which were broken down , and its gates were consu@@ med with fire .
then went I up in the night by the Bro@@ ok , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the val@@ ley gate , and so returned .
the rul@@ ers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest who did the work .
but when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , and G@@ es@@ hem the Ara@@ bi@@ an , heard it , they ri@@ dic@@ uled us , and desp@@ ised us , and said , " What is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? "
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est rose up with his brothers the pri@@ ests , and they built the she@@ ep gate ; they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and set up its doors ; even to the to@@ wer of Ham@@ me@@ ah they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , to the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ el .
next to them , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ ah , the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z made repairs . next to them , Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ el made repairs . next to them , Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana made repairs .
next to them , the Tek@@ o@@ ites made repairs ; but their no@@ bles di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put their nec@@ ks to the work of their lor@@ d .
Jo@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah rep@@ aired the old gate . they laid its be@@ ams , and set up its doors , and its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to them , Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , rep@@ aired the residence of the governor beyond the River .
next to him , Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths , made repairs . next to him , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah one of the perf@@ um@@ ers made repairs , and they for@@ ti@@ fied Jer@@ usalem even to the broad wall .
next to them , Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ur , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Jer@@ usalem , made repairs .
next to him , S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Hal@@ lo@@ hes@@ h , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Jer@@ usalem , he and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , made repairs .
Han@@ un and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah rep@@ aired the val@@ ley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars , and one thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts of the wall to the D@@ ung gate .
Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the district of Beth Hac@@ ch@@ er@@ em rep@@ aired the D@@ ung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
after him , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Beth Z@@ ur , made repairs to the place opposite the tom@@ bs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty men .
next to him , E@@ zer the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the ru@@ ler of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , rep@@ aired another portion , across from the as@@ cent to the arm@@ ory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ ah the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z rep@@ aired another portion , from the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b even to the end of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer that stands out from the up@@ per house of the king , which is by the court of the guard . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h made repairs .
after them , Zad@@ ok the son of Im@@ mer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the keep@@ er of the east gate made repairs .
after him , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and Han@@ un the sixth son of Zal@@ ap@@ h , rep@@ aired another portion . after him , Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah made repairs across from his room .
after him , Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah one of the gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths to the house of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , and of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , made repairs over against the gate of Ham@@ m@@ ip@@ h@@ k@@ ad , and to the as@@ cent of the cor@@ ner .
but it happened that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
D@@ on '@@ t cover their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and don '@@ t let their sin be blo@@ t@@ ted out from before you ; for they have ins@@ ulted the buil@@ ders . "
but it happened that when San@@ bal@@ lat , To@@ bi@@ ah , the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ di@@ tes heard that the rep@@ air@@ ing of the walls of Jer@@ usalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their bo@@ ws .
it happened , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the co@@ ats of mail ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they all built the wall and those who b@@ ore bur@@ den@@ s loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the buil@@ ders , everyone wor@@ e his s@@ word at his side , and so built . he who so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
so we worked in the work : and half of them held the spe@@ ars from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his ser@@ vant lo@@ dge within Jer@@ usalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may la@@ bor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clo@@ th@@ es . everyone took his weapon to the water .
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
moreover there were at my table , of the Jews and the rul@@ ers , one hundred fif@@ ty men , besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us .
you have also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of you at Jer@@ usalem , saying , ' There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together . "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imag@@ ine them out of your own heart . "
I said , " Sho@@ uld such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temp@@ le to save his life ? I will not go in . "
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
it happened , when all our enem@@ ies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
moreover in those days the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h sent many letters to To@@ bi@@ ah , and To@@ bi@@ ah 's letters came to them .
for there were many in Ju@@ da@@ h sworn to him , because he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an had taken the daughter of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah as wife .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the por@@ ters and the singers and the L@@ evi@@ tes were appointed ,
that I put my brother Han@@ ani , and Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jer@@ usalem ; for he was a fa@@ ith@@ ful man , and fear@@ ed God above many .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ three .
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ ida ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth Haz@@ z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of Am@@ on .
these were those who went up from Tel Me@@ lah , Tel Har@@ s@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ don , and Im@@ mer ; but they could not show their fa@@ thers ' houses , nor their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two .
of the pri@@ ests : the children of H@@ ob@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , until there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
some from among the heads of fa@@ thers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treas@@ ury one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , fif@@ ty bas@@ ins , and five hundred thirty pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households gave into the treas@@ ury of the work twenty thousand dar@@ ics of gold , and two thousand two hundred min@@ as of silver .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
also J@@ es@@ hua , and Ban@@ i , and S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , J@@ amin , Ak@@ ku@@ b , Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai , Ho@@ di@@ ah , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , Kel@@ ita , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , Joz@@ ab@@ ad , H@@ anan , Pe@@ la@@ i@@ ah , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stayed in their place .
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinc@@ tly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to give attention to the words of the law .
they found written in the law , how that Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded by Mos@@ es , that the children of Israel should d@@ well in bo@@ o@@ ths in the feast of the seventh month ;
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , everyone on the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and lived in the bo@@ o@@ ths ; for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
also day by day , from the first day to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , according to the ordin@@ ance .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ ped Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
and showed signs and won@@ ders against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them , and made a name for yo@@ ur@@ self , as it is this day .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and you cast their pursu@@ ers into the dep@@ ths , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover , in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud you led them by day ; and in a pil@@ lar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and made known to them your hol@@ y Sab@@ b@@ ath , and comman@@ ded them comman@@ d@@ ments , and stat@@ utes , and a law , by Mos@@ es your ser@@ vant ,
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and comman@@ ded them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which you had sworn to give them .
yes , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed aw@@ ful b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies ;
you gave also your good Spiri@@ t to instruc@@ t them , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t with@@ hold your man@@ na from their m@@ outh , and gave them water for their thir@@ st .
" yes , for@@ ty years you sustained them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . they la@@ cked nothing . their clo@@ th@@ es di@@ d@@ n '@@ t grow old , and their feet di@@ d@@ n '@@ t s@@ well .
moreover you gave them k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms and peoples , which you al@@ lot@@ ted according to their por@@ tions . so they poss@@ essed the land of S@@ ih@@ on , even the land of the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an .
you also multi@@ p@@ lied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
" nevertheless they were dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent , and rebel@@ led against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your pro@@ ph@@ ets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed aw@@ ful b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spiri@@ t through your pro@@ ph@@ ets . yet would they not give e@@ ar . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept your law , nor list@@ ened to your comman@@ d@@ ments and your testimon@@ ies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in your great Go@@ od@@ ness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
" be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fa@@ thers to eat its fruit and its good , be@@ hold , we are servants in it .
it yi@@ elds much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have power over our bodies , and over our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
now those who sealed were : Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the governor , the son of Hac@@ ali@@ ah , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ,
and that we would not give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to the peoples of the land , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fru@@ its of our ground , and the first fru@@ its of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ born of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , to the pri@@ ests who minister in the house of our God ;
the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
the pr@@ inces of the people lived in Jer@@ usalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem the hol@@ y city , and nine parts in the other cities .
in Jer@@ usalem lived certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Col@@ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite .
all the sons of Per@@ ez who lived in Jer@@ usalem were four hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight val@@ i@@ ant men .
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fa@@ thers ' households , two hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and A@@ mas@@ h@@ sa@@ i the son of A@@ zar@@ el , the son of Ah@@ zai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their brothers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight ; and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of Hag@@ g@@ ed@@ ol@@ im .
and Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , of the chiefs of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who had the over@@ sight of the ou@@ tw@@ ard business of God 's house ;
P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ el , of the children of Zer@@ ah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h lived in Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba and its towns , and in Di@@ bon and its towns , and in J@@ ek@@ ab@@ z@@ e@@ el and its villages ,
J@@ es@@ hua became the father of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im became the father of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , and Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b became the father of Jo@@ i@@ ada ,
as for the L@@ evi@@ tes , in the days of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , Jo@@ i@@ ada , and Johan@@ an , and Jad@@ du@@ a , there were recorded the heads of fa@@ thers ' households ; also the pri@@ ests , in the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the Per@@ sian .
the sons of L@@ evi , heads of fa@@ thers ' households , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
the chiefs of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Has@@ habi@@ ah , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Kad@@ mi@@ el , with their brothers over against them , to praise and give thanks , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David the man of God , watch next to watch .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est the s@@ cri@@ be .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in proc@@ ession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the D@@ ung gate ;
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets : Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h ;
and his brothers , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ el , Mil@@ al@@ ai , G@@ il@@ al@@ ai , Ma@@ ai , N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and Ju@@ da@@ h , Han@@ ani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be was before them .
by the spring gate , and stra@@ ight before them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the as@@ cent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Ham@@ me@@ ah , even to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the pur@@ ification , and so did the singers and the por@@ ters , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David , and of Solomon his son .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ abi@@ te should not enter into the assembly of God fore@@ ver ,
now before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the pri@@ est , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being al@@ lied to To@@ bi@@ ah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jer@@ usalem ; for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Bab@@ yl@@ on I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jer@@ usalem , and understood the ev@@ il that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b had done for To@@ bi@@ ah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I comman@@ ded , and they cleans@@ ed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the me@@ al offer@@ ings and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them ; so that the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don '@@ t wi@@ pe out my good de@@ eds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its obser@@ van@@ ces .
there lived men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , who brought in fish , and all kinds of war@@ es , and sold on the Sab@@ b@@ ath to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Wh@@ y do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on the Sab@@ b@@ ath .
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ash@@ do@@ d , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and struck certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , " You shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
thus I cleans@@ ed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the pri@@ ests and for the L@@ evi@@ tes , everyone in his work ;
now it happened in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us who re@@ ig@@ ned from India even to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his pr@@ inces and his servants ; the power of Per@@ sia and Media , the no@@ bles and pr@@ inces of the provinces , being before him .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both great and small , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not comp@@ ul@@ sory ; for so the king had instruc@@ ted all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's cust@@ om to cons@@ ult those who knew law and judgment ;
Mem@@ uc@@ an answ@@ ered before the king and the pr@@ inces , " V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the pr@@ inces , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een will become known to all women , causing them to show con@@ temp@@ t for their hus@@ bands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom ( for it is great ) , all the wi@@ ves will give their hus@@ bands hon@@ or , both great and small . "
for he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to its writing , and to every people in their language , that every man should rule his own house , speaking in the language of his own people .
after these things , when the wr@@ ath of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us was p@@ ac@@ ified , he remember@@ ed V@@ ash@@ ti , and what she had done , and what was decre@@ ed against her .
there was a certain J@@ ew in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of K@@ ish , a Benj@@ am@@ ite ,
who had been carried away from Jer@@ usalem with the cap@@ tives who had been carried away with J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away .
Mor@@ dec@@ ai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Es@@ ther was doing , and what would become of her .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
so Es@@ ther was taken to King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Te@@ bet@@ h , in the seventh year of his reign .
the king lov@@ ed Es@@ ther more than all the women , and she obtained fav@@ or and kin@@ d@@ ness in his sight more than all the vir@@ g@@ ins ; so that he set the royal cro@@ wn on her head , and made her qu@@ een instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , who were do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
when this matter was investigated , and it was found to be so , they were both han@@ ged on a tree ; and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les in the king 's presence .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bo@@ wed down , and paid H@@ om@@ age to Ham@@ an ; for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bo@@ w down or pay him H@@ om@@ age .
but he scor@@ ned the thought of lay@@ ing hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone , for they had made known to him Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's people . therefore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's people .
if it ple@@ ases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand tal@@ ents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies . "
the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it to Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the Jews ' enemy .
the king said to Ham@@ an , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
the cour@@ i@@ ers went forth in has@@ te by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and the decree was given out in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a . the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city of Sh@@ us@@ han was per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed .
now when Mor@@ dec@@ ai found out all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and w@@ ailed l@@ ou@@ dly and a bit@@ ter@@ ly .
in every province , wher@@ ever the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fas@@ ting , and we@@ eping , and w@@ ailing ; and many lay in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
Es@@ ther 's ma@@ i@@ den@@ s and her e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s came and told her this , and the qu@@ een was exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed . she sent clo@@ thing to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to replace his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive it .
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and comman@@ ded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
now it happened on the third day that Es@@ ther put on her royal clo@@ thing , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , she obtained fav@@ or in his sight ; and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ ter that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther came near , and touched the top of the scep@@ ter .
then the king said , " Br@@ ing Ham@@ an quickly , so that it may be done as Es@@ ther has said . " so the king and Ham@@ an came to the ban@@ qu@@ et that Es@@ ther had prepared .
the king said to Es@@ ther at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed . "
then Ham@@ an went out that day jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart , but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wr@@ ath against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
Ham@@ an re@@ counted to them the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , the multi@@ tude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night , the king co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t sle@@ ep . he comman@@ ded the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said , " Wh@@ o is in the court ? " now Ham@@ an had come into the ou@@ ter court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about han@@ ging Mor@@ dec@@ ai on the gal@@ lows that he had prepared for him .
the king said again to Es@@ ther on the second day at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , " What is your petition , qu@@ een Es@@ ther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed . "
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered , " If I have found fav@@ or in your sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
on that day , King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us gave the house of Ham@@ an , the Jews ' enemy , to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een . Mor@@ dec@@ ai came before the king ; for Es@@ ther had told what he was to her .
Es@@ ther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and beg@@ ged him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
for how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the ev@@ il that would come to my people ? how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the J@@ ew , " Se@@ e , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Cour@@ ier on hor@@ se@@ back , ri@@ ding on royal hor@@ ses that were bread from swift ste@@ eds .
a cop@@ y of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
so the cour@@ i@@ ers who ro@@ de on royal hor@@ ses went out , has@@ tened and pressed on by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment . the decree was given out in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a .
all the pr@@ inces of the provinces , the sat@@ ra@@ ps , the govern@@ ors , and those who did the king 's business helped the Jews , because the fear of Mor@@ dec@@ ai had fallen on them .
for Mor@@ dec@@ ai was great in the king 's house , and his f@@ ame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mor@@ dec@@ ai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enem@@ ies with the stro@@ ke of the s@@ word , and with sla@@ ughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who ha@@ ted them .
they killed Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , Dal@@ ph@@ on , A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
on that day , the number of those who were sla@@ in in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a was brought before the king .
then Es@@ ther said , " If it ple@@ ases the king , let it be granted to the Jews who are in Sh@@ us@@ han to do tomorrow also according to this day 's decree , and let Ham@@ an 's ten sons be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows . "
the Jews who were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and killed three hundred men in Sh@@ us@@ han ; but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t lay their hand on the sp@@ oil .
but the Jews who were in Sh@@ us@@ han assemb@@ led together on the thir@@ teen@@ th and on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th days of the month ; and on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gla@@ d@@ ness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the un@@ wal@@ led towns , make the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gla@@ d@@ ness and fe@@ asting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
because Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a , the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plot@@ ted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consum@@ e them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he had dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
and that these days should be remember@@ ed and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of Pur@@ im should not fail from among the Jews , nor their memory per@@ ish from their se@@ ed .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to which the king advanced him , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
there was a man in the land of U@@ z , whose name was Jo@@ b . that man was bla@@ me@@ less and u@@ pri@@ ght , and one who fear@@ ed God , and turned away from ev@@ il .
his pos@@ sessions also were seven thousand she@@ ep , three thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , five hundred yok@@ e of ox@@ en , five hundred female don@@ ke@@ ys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " then S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
it fell on a day when his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
and the Sab@@ e@@ ans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the s@@ word , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Y@@ our sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
he said , " nak@@ ed I came out of my mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and nak@@ ed shall I return there . Yah@@ we@@ h gave , and Yah@@ we@@ h has taken away . b@@ les@@ sed be the name of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yah@@ we@@ h , that S@@ atan came also among them to present himself before Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
so S@@ atan went forth from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , and struck Jo@@ b with painful so@@ res from the sole of his fo@@ ot to his head .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize him , they raised their voices , and we@@ pt ; and they each t@@ ore his ro@@ be , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust on their heads toward the sky .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven n@@ ights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his gri@@ ef was very great .
let d@@ ark@@ ness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cl@@ oud d@@ well on it . let all that makes black the day ter@@ ri@@ fy it .
as for that night , let th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize on it . let it not re@@ jo@@ ice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its tw@@ il@@ ight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the ey@@ eli@@ ds of the morning ,
because it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t shut up the doors of my mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t I die from the w@@ om@@ b ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t I give up the spirit when my mother b@@ ore me ?
for now should I have la@@ in down and been quiet . I should have sle@@ pt , then I would have been at rest ,
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .
the ro@@ aring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the te@@ eth of the young li@@ ons , are broken .
how much more , those who d@@ well in houses of cla@@ y , whose foundation is in the d@@ ust , who are cr@@ us@@ hed before the mo@@ th !
so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mour@@ n are ex@@ al@@ ted to safety .
you shall be hidden from the s@@ cour@@ ge of the ton@@ gue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
for you shall be al@@ lied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall know also that your se@@ ed shall be great , Y@@ our off@@ spring as the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of gra@@ in comes in its season .
even that it would ple@@ ase God to cr@@ ush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my con@@ so@@ lation , yes , let me ex@@ ult in p@@ ain that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t spar@@ e , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
" to him who is ready to fa@@ int , kin@@ d@@ ness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who for@@ sak@@ es the fear of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Tos@@ s and turn until the da@@ w@@ ning of the day .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the an@@ gu@@ ish of my spirit . I will complain in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
if I have sin@@ ned , what do I do to you , you wat@@ cher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
why do you not par@@ don my dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and take away my in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I lie down in the d@@ ust . you will seek me dil@@ ig@@ ently , but I shall not be . "
if it is a matter of strength , be@@ hold , he is m@@ igh@@ ty ! if of justice , ' Wh@@ o , ' says he , ' will sum@@ mon me ? '
though I am righ@@ te@@ ous , my own m@@ outh shall condemn me . though I am bla@@ me@@ less , it shall prove me per@@ verse .
the ear@@ th is given into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and che@@ er up ; '
" my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
is it good to you that you should op@@ press , that you should desp@@ ise the work of your hands , and sm@@ ile on the coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked ?
although you know that I am not w@@ ic@@ ked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
if I am w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e to me . if I am righ@@ te@@ ous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with dis@@ grace , and con@@ sci@@ ous of my aff@@ li@@ ction .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the w@@ om@@ b to the grave .
that he would show you the secre@@ ts of wis@@ dom ! for true wis@@ dom has two sides . know therefore that God ex@@ acts of you less than your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity de@@ serves .
su@@ rely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Y@@ es , you shall be stead@@ fast , and shall not fear :
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not in@@ fer@@ ior to you . yes , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a j@@ oke to his neigh@@ bor , I , who called on God , and he answ@@ ered . the just , the bla@@ me@@ less man is a j@@ oke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is con@@ temp@@ t for mis@@ fortun@@ e . it is ready for them whose fo@@ ot sli@@ ps .
who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know that in all these , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h has done this ,
be@@ hold , he breaks down , and it can '@@ t be built again . he im@@ prisons a man , and there can be no release .
be@@ hold , he With@@ holds the waters , and they d@@ ry up . again , he sends them out , and they over@@ turn the ear@@ th .
he re@@ moves the speech of those who are tr@@ usted , and takes away the understanding of the el@@ ders .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the ear@@ th , and causes them to w@@ ander in a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where there is no way .
you also put my feet in the sto@@ cks , and mark all my p@@ aths . you set a bound to the so@@ les of my feet ,
he comes forth like a f@@ lower , and is cut down . he also fle@@ es like a shadow , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t continue .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bo@@ unds that he can '@@ t pass ;
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will s@@ pro@@ ut again , that the tender branch of it will not ce@@ ase .
" O@@ h that you would hide me in She@@ ol , that you would keep me secret , until your wr@@ ath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the waters wear the stones . the tor@@ ren@@ ts of it was@@ h away the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th . so you destroy the hope of man .
his sons come to hon@@ or , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know it . they are brought low , but he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t perce@@ ive it of them .
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righ@@ te@@ ous ?
be@@ hold , he puts no trust in his hol@@ y ones . yes , the heav@@ ens are not clean in his sight ;
the w@@ ic@@ ked man wri@@ th@@ es in p@@ ain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the op@@ pres@@ sor .
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe that he shall return out of d@@ ark@@ ness . he is w@@ aited for by the s@@ word .
he w@@ and@@ ers abroad for bread , saying , ' W@@ here is it ? ' he knows that the day of d@@ ark@@ ness is ready at his hand .
he has lived in de@@ so@@ late cities , in houses which no one inhabited , which were ready to become he@@ aps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his sub@@ stance continue , neither shall their pos@@ sessions be extended on the ear@@ th .
he shall not de@@ part out of d@@ ark@@ ness . the fla@@ me shall d@@ ry up his branches . by the bre@@ ath of God 's m@@ outh shall he go away .
he shall shake off his un@@ ri@@ pe gra@@ pe as the v@@ ine , and shall cast off his f@@ lower as the olive tree .
I also could speak as you do . if your sou@@ l were in my sou@@ l 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
he has torn me in his wr@@ ath , and persec@@ uted me . he has gn@@ ashed on me with his te@@ eth . my ad@@ versary shar@@ pen@@ s his eyes on me .
they have g@@ ap@@ ed on me with their m@@ outh . they have struck me on the che@@ ek re@@ pro@@ ach@@ fully . they gather themselves together against me .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the nec@@ k , and d@@ ashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his ar@@ chers sur@@ round me . he sp@@ l@@ its my kid@@ neys apart , and does not spar@@ e . he po@@ urs out my g@@ all on the ground .
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the wor@@ m , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he tru@@ sts . he shall be brought to the king of terr@@ ors .
there shall d@@ well in his tent that which is none of his . sul@@ f@@ ur shall be sc@@ at@@ tered on his habi@@ tation .
those who d@@ well in my house , and my ma@@ ids , count me for a st@@ ran@@ ger . I am an ali@@ en in their sight .
I call to my ser@@ vant , and he gives me no answer . I be@@ g him with my m@@ outh .
my b@@ ones stick to my s@@ kin and to my f@@ les@@ h . I have escaped by the s@@ kin of my te@@ eth .
but as for me , I know that my Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer lives . in the end , he will stand upon the ear@@ th .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a st@@ ran@@ ger . " my heart is consu@@ med within me .
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . yes , he shall be ch@@ ased away like a vision of the night .
he has sw@@ allowed down ri@@ ches , and he shall v@@ om@@ it them up again . God will cast them out of his bel@@ ly .
that for which he la@@ bo@@ red he shall restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down . according to the sub@@ stance that he has gotten , he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice .
for he has op@@ pressed and for@@ sak@@ en the poor . he has viol@@ ently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
in the ful@@ l@@ ness of his suffici@@ ency , dist@@ ress shall over@@ take him . the hand of everyone who is in mis@@ ery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God will cast the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath on him . it will rain on him while he is e@@ ating .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the g@@ lit@@ tering point comes out of his li@@ ver . Terr@@ ors are on him .
all d@@ ark@@ ness is laid up for his treasures . an un@@ fan@@ ned fire shall dev@@ our him . it shall consum@@ e that which is left in his tent .
" how often is it that the lam@@ p of the w@@ ic@@ ked is put out , that their cal@@ am@@ ity comes on them , that God distribu@@ tes sor@@ ro@@ ws in his an@@ ger ?
you say , ' God lays up his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity for his children . ' let him re@@ compen@@ se it to himself , that he may know it .
you ha@@ ven '@@ t given water to the we@@ ary to drink , and you have with@@ held bread from the hun@@ gry .
th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds are a covering to him , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see . he walk@@ s on the va@@ ult of the sky . '
saying , ' su@@ rely those who rose up against us are cut off . the fire has consu@@ med their re@@ mn@@ ant . '
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall sh@@ ine on your ways .
he works to the north , but I can '@@ t see him . he turns south , but I can '@@ t catch a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of him .
my fo@@ ot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I ha@@ ven '@@ t gone back from the comman@@ d@@ ment of his li@@ ps . I have treas@@ ured up the words of his m@@ outh more than my necessary food .
be@@ hold , as wild don@@ ke@@ ys in the de@@ sert , they go forth to their work , seeking dil@@ ig@@ ently for food . the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness yi@@ elds them bread for their children .
from out of the popul@@ ous city , men gro@@ an . the sou@@ l of the wounded cri@@ es out , yet God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t regard the Fol@@ ly .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don '@@ t know its ways , nor stay in its p@@ aths .
in the dark they di@@ g through houses . they shut themselves up in the day@@ time . they don '@@ t know the light .
for the morning is to all of them like th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness , for they know the terr@@ ors of the th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness .
they are ex@@ al@@ ted ; yet a little while , and they are gone . yes , they are brought low , they are taken out of the way as all others , and are cut off as the tops of the e@@ ars of gra@@ in .
he has described a bo@@ und@@ ary on the sur@@ face of the waters , and to the con@@ fines of light and d@@ ark@@ ness .
( for the length of my life is still in me , and the spirit of God is in my nos@@ tr@@ ils ) ;
far be it from me that I should justify you . until I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
I hold fast to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not re@@ pro@@ ach me so long as I live .
for it hur@@ ls at him , and does not spar@@ e , as he fle@@ es away from his hand .
he breaks open a S@@ haf@@ t away from where people live . they are forgotten by the fo@@ ot . they han@@ g far from men , they s@@ wing back and forth .
he bin@@ ds the stre@@ ams that they don '@@ t tri@@ ck@@ le . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
he establis@@ hes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
the voice of the no@@ bles was hus@@ hed , and their ton@@ gue st@@ uck to the ro@@ of of their m@@ outh .
for when the e@@ ar heard me , then it b@@ les@@ sed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commen@@ ded me :
the b@@ les@@ sing of him who was ready to per@@ ish came on me , and I caused the wi@@ dow 's heart to sing for joy .
I was a father to the ne@@ edy . the cause of him who I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , I searched out .
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any def@@ il@@ ement has st@@ uck to my hands ,
then let me so@@ w , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
for that would be a he@@ in@@ ous crime . yes , it would be an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judges :
" if I have desp@@ ised the cause of my male ser@@ vant or of my female ser@@ vant , when they conten@@ ded with me ;
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I gui@@ ded from my mother 's w@@ om@@ b ) ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fa@@ ther@@ less , because I saw my help in the gate ,
then let my sho@@ ul@@ der fall from the sho@@ ul@@ der bla@@ de , and my arm be broken from the bone .
this also would be an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
then the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el , the Buz@@ ite , of the family of R@@ am , was kin@@ d@@ led against Jo@@ b . his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led because he justified himself rather than God .
" be@@ hold , I w@@ aited for your words , and I list@@ ened for your reas@@ oning , while you searched out what to say .
I will speak , that I may be ref@@ res@@ hed . I will open my li@@ ps and answer .
ple@@ ase don '@@ t let me respect any man 's person , neither will I give f@@ lat@@ tering titles to any man .
for I don '@@ t know how to give f@@ lat@@ tering titles ; or else my Mak@@ er would soon take me away .
" su@@ rely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sle@@ ep falls on men , in s@@ lum@@ ber@@ ing on the bed ;
for the work of a man he will ren@@ der to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the aff@@ lic@@ ted .
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sin@@ ned ? '
if you have sin@@ ned , what effect do you have against him ? if your trans@@ gres@@ sions are multi@@ p@@ lied , what do you do to him ?
" by reason of the multi@@ tude of op@@ pres@@ sions they cry out . they cry for help by reason of the arm of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
how much less when you say you don '@@ t see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t preserve the life of the w@@ ic@@ ked , but gives to the aff@@ lic@@ ted their right .
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t withdraw his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous , but with kings on the th@@ r@@ one , he sets them fore@@ ver , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
yes , he would have al@@ lu@@ red you out of dist@@ ress , into a broad place , where there is no re@@ stri@@ ction . that which is set on your table would be full of fat@@ ness .
after it a voice ro@@ ars . he th@@ unders with the voice of his maj@@ es@@ ty . he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t hold back anything when his voice is heard .
for he says to the snow , ' F@@ all on the ear@@ th ; ' likewise to the sho@@ wer of rain , and to the sho@@ wers of his m@@ igh@@ ty rain .
now men don '@@ t see the light which is bright in the sk@@ ies , but the wind passes , and clears them .
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in which there is no man ;
out of whose w@@ om@@ b came the ice ? the gra@@ y F@@ ro@@ st of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don '@@ t return again .
will you confi@@ de in him , that he will bring home your se@@ ed , and gather the gra@@ in of your th@@ res@@ hing floor ?
she deals har@@ sh@@ ly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her la@@ bor is in v@@ ain , she is without fear ,
he e@@ ats up the ground with fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess and ra@@ ge , neither does he stand still at the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et .
on the c@@ lif@@ f he d@@ wel@@ ls , and makes his home , on the point of the c@@ lif@@ f , and the stron@@ gh@@ old .
p@@ our out the fur@@ y of your an@@ ger . look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low .
be@@ hold , the hope of him is in v@@ ain . won '@@ t one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can '@@ t be pulled apart .
the f@@ lak@@ es of his f@@ les@@ h are joined together . they are firm on him . they can '@@ t be moved .
you asked , ' Wh@@ o is this who hi@@ des coun@@ sel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have ut@@ tered that which I did not understand , things too won@@ der@@ ful for me , which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know .
it was so , that after Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken these words to Jo@@ b , Yah@@ we@@ h said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , " My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b has .

the kings of the ear@@ th take a stand , and the rul@@ ers take coun@@ sel together , against Yah@@ we@@ h , and against his A@@ no@@ in@@ ted , saying ,

you have also given me the shield of your sal@@ vation . your right hand sustain@@ s me . your g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess has made me great .
I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . they shall fall under my feet .
you have also made my enem@@ ies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who h@@ ate me .
you have delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me they shall obe@@ y me . the foreigners shall submit themselves to me .
he resc@@ ues me from my enem@@ ies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .

the way of Yah@@ we@@ h is a stron@@ gh@@ old to the u@@ pri@@ ght , but it is a destruction to the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
one who brings g@@ os@@ sip bet@@ r@@ ays a confidence , but one who is of a tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy spirit is one who keeps a secret .
a gr@@ ac@@ ious woman ob@@ tains hon@@ or , but violent men obtain ri@@ ches .
those who are per@@ verse in heart are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , but those whose ways are bla@@ me@@ less are his de@@ light .
there is one who sc@@ at@@ ters , and increases yet more . there is one who With@@ holds more than is appropriate , but gains poverty .
the words of the w@@ ic@@ ked are about lying in wait for blood , but the speech of the u@@ pri@@ ght resc@@ ues them .
a man shall be commen@@ ded according to his wis@@ dom , but he who has a war@@ ped mind shall be desp@@ ised .
better is he who is lightly es@@ te@@ emed , and has a ser@@ vant , than he who hon@@ ors himself , and lacks bread .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his m@@ outh . the work of a man 's hands shall be re@@ warded to him .
there are some who pre@@ tend to be rich , yet have nothing . there are some who pre@@ tend to be poor , yet have great wealth .
good understanding wins fav@@ or ; but the way of the un@@ fa@@ ith@@ ful is hard .
a good man leaves an inher@@ it@@ ance to his children 's children , but the wealth of the sin@@ ner is stored for the righ@@ te@@ ous .
in the multi@@ tude of people is the king 's gl@@ ory , but in the lack of people is the destruction of the pr@@ ince .
he who is slow to an@@ ger has great understanding , but he who has a quick tem@@ per dis@@ plays Fol@@ ly .
the king 's fav@@ or is toward a ser@@ vant who deals wis@@ ely , but his wr@@ ath is toward one who causes sh@@ ame .
how much better it is to get wis@@ dom than gold ! yes , to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver .
one who win@@ ks his eyes to plot per@@ versities , one who com@@ pres@@ ses his li@@ ps , is b@@ ent on ev@@ il .
one who is slow to an@@ ger is better than the m@@ igh@@ ty ; one who rules his spirit , than he who takes a city .
a bribe is a pre@@ ci@@ ous stone in the eyes of him who gives it ; wher@@ ever he turns , he prosp@@ ers .
he who justi@@ fies the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he who condem@@ ns the righ@@ te@@ ous , both of them alike are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h .
wis@@ dom is before the face of one who has understanding , but the eyes of a fo@@ ol w@@ ander to the ends of the ear@@ th .
even a fo@@ ol , when he keeps silent , is counted wise . when he sh@@ u@@ ts his li@@ ps , he is thought to be dis@@ cer@@ ning .
one who is S@@ lack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction .
a man 's st@@ om@@ ach is filled with the fruit of his m@@ outh . with the har@@ v@@ est of his li@@ ps he is satisfied .
it is@@ n '@@ t good to have z@@ e@@ al without knowledge ; nor being has@@ ty with one 's feet and missing the way .
that which makes a man to be desi@@ red is his kin@@ d@@ ness . a poor man is better than a li@@ ar .
the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h leads to life , then cont@@ ent@@ ment ; he rests and will not be touched by trouble .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d bur@@ ies his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his m@@ outh again .
the terror of a king is like the ro@@ aring of a lion . he who provok@@ es him to an@@ ger for@@ fe@@ its his own life .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d will not plo@@ w by reason of the winter ; therefore he shall be@@ g in har@@ v@@ est , and have nothing .
D@@ on '@@ t love sle@@ ep , lest you come to poverty . open your eyes , and you shall be satisfied with bread .
he who goes about as a tal@@ e @@@ -@@ @ be@@ ar@@ er reve@@ als secre@@ ts ; therefore don '@@ t keep company with him who opens wide his li@@ ps .
it is a sn@@ are to a man to make a ras@@ h dedic@@ ation , then later to consider his vows .
it is better to d@@ well in the cor@@ ner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than to share a house with a conten@@ tious woman .
who@@ ever stops his e@@ ars at the cry of the poor , he will also cry out , but shall not be heard .
the man who w@@ and@@ ers out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not de@@ part from it .
for it is a pleas@@ ant thing if you keep them within you , if all of them are ready on your li@@ ps .
why do you set your eyes on that which is not ? for it certainly s@@ pro@@ u@@ ts w@@ ings like an e@@ ag@@ le and f@@ lies in the sky .
D@@ on '@@ t look at the wine when it is red , when it spar@@ k@@ les in the c@@ up , when it goes down smoothly .
yes , you will be as he who lies down in the mid@@ st of the sea , or as he who lies on top of the ri@@ gging :
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don '@@ t feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
if you say , " be@@ hold , we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know this " ; do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he who weigh@@ s the hear@@ ts consider it ? he who keeps your sou@@ l , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he know it ? shall he not ren@@ der to every man according to his work ?
so you shall know wis@@ dom to be to your sou@@ l ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
D@@ on '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice when your enemy falls . D@@ on '@@ t let your heart be glad when he is over@@ thrown ;
for there will be no reward to the ev@@ il man ; and the lam@@ p of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ed out .
D@@ on '@@ t say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will ren@@ der to the man according to his work . "
I went by the field of the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d , by the v@@ ine@@ yard of the man vo@@ id of understanding ;
be@@ hold , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns . its sur@@ face was covered with net@@ t@@ les , and its stone wall was broken down .
it is the gl@@ ory of God to conce@@ al a thing , but the gl@@ ory of kings is to search out a matter .
for it is better that it be said to you , " C@@ ome up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince , whom your eyes have seen .
as the cold of snow in the time of har@@ v@@ est , so is a fa@@ ith@@ ful mes@@ sen@@ ger to those who send him ; for he ref@@ res@@ hes the sou@@ l of his mas@@ ters .
have you found hon@@ ey ? eat as much as is sufficient for you , lest you eat too much , and v@@ om@@ it it .
if your enemy is hun@@ gry , give him food to eat . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
it is better to d@@ well in the cor@@ ner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than to share a house with a conten@@ tious woman .
like the leg@@ s of the la@@ me that han@@ g loose : so is a par@@ able in the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols .
D@@ on '@@ t for@@ sake your friend and your father 's friend . D@@ on '@@ t go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neigh@@ bor who is near than a distant brother .
he who b@@ les@@ ses his neigh@@ bor with a l@@ oud voice early in the morning , it will be taken as a cur@@ se by him .
though you gr@@ ind a fo@@ ol in a mort@@ ar with a p@@ est@@ le along with gra@@ in , yet his fo@@ ol@@ ishness will not be removed from him .
there will be plenty of go@@ ats ' milk for your food , for your family 's food , and for the no@@ ur@@ is@@ hment of your ser@@ vant girls .
better is the poor who walk@@ s in his integrity , than he who is per@@ verse in his ways , and he is rich .
one who works his land will have an ab@@ und@@ ance of food ; but one who ch@@ ases fan@@ tas@@ ies will have his fill of poverty .
who@@ ever ro@@ bs his father or his mother , and says , " It 's not wrong . " he is a partner with a destro@@ yer .
if a wise man goes to court with a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , the fo@@ ol ra@@ ges or sco@@ ffs , and there is no peace .
who@@ ever is an accomp@@ lice of a th@@ i@@ ef is an enemy of his own sou@@ l . he takes an oath , but dar@@ es not testify .
the fear of man proves to be a sn@@ are , but who@@ ever puts his trust in Yah@@ we@@ h is kept safe .
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Wh@@ o is Yah@@ we@@ h ? ' or lest I be poor , and ste@@ al , and so dis@@ hon@@ or the name of my God .
there is a generation whose te@@ eth are like s@@ words , and their j@@ a@@ ws like k@@ ni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from the ear@@ th , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
" the eye that mo@@ cks at his father , and scor@@ ns obe@@ di@@ ence to his mother : the ra@@ ven@@ s of the val@@ ley shall pick it out , the young e@@ ag@@ les shall eat it .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ iden .
for as the chur@@ ning of milk brings forth but@@ ter , and the wr@@ inging of the n@@ ose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wr@@ ath brings forth stri@@ fe . "
it is not for kings , L@@ em@@ uel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for pr@@ inces to say , ' W@@ here is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and per@@ ver@@ t the justice due to anyone who is aff@@ lic@@ ted .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continu@@ ally as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wis@@ dom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and be@@ hold , all is van@@ ity and a ch@@ asing after wind .
that which is cro@@ oked can '@@ t be made stra@@ ight ; and that which is lacking can '@@ t be counted .
I also gathered silver and gold for myself , and the treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got myself male and female singers , and the deli@@ ghts of the sons of men@@ -@@ -@@ musical instruments , and that of all sor@@ ts .
then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked , and at the la@@ bor that I had la@@ bo@@ red to do ; and be@@ hold , all was van@@ ity and a ch@@ asing after wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
for of the wise man , even as of the fo@@ ol , there is no memory for ever , since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten . indeed , the wise man must die just like the fo@@ ol !
who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet he will have rule over all of my la@@ bor in which I have la@@ bo@@ red , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is van@@ ity .
therefore I began to cause my heart to desp@@ air concerning all the la@@ bor in which I had la@@ bo@@ red under the sun .
for all his days are sor@@ ro@@ ws , and his trav@@ ail is gri@@ ef ; yes , even in the night his heart takes no rest . this also is van@@ ity .
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his sou@@ l enjoy good in his la@@ bor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set et@@ ern@@ ity in their hear@@ ts , yet so that man can '@@ t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there ; and in the place of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes up@@ ward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes down@@ ward to the ear@@ th ? "
then I returned and saw all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold , the te@@ ars of those who were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the ev@@ il work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but wo@@ e to him who is alone when he falls , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have another to lift him up .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
there was no end of all the people , even of all them over whom he was@@ -@@ -@@ yet those who come after shall not re@@ jo@@ ice in him . su@@ rely this also is van@@ ity and a ch@@ asing after wind .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fo@@ ols , for they don '@@ t know that they do ev@@ il .
D@@ on '@@ t be ras@@ h with your m@@ outh , and don '@@ t let your heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter anything before God ; for God is in heav@@ en , and you on ear@@ th . therefore let your words be few .
when you vo@@ w a vo@@ w to God , don '@@ t def@@ er to pay it ; for he has no pleas@@ ure in fo@@ ols . pay that which you vo@@ w .
D@@ on '@@ t allow your m@@ outh to lead you into sin . D@@ on '@@ t protest before the mes@@ sen@@ ger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
he who lov@@ es silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he who lov@@ es ab@@ und@@ ance , with increase : this also is van@@ ity .
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sle@@ ep of a labor@@ ing man is swe@@ et , whether he e@@ ats little or much ; but the ab@@ und@@ ance of the rich will not allow him to sle@@ ep .
as he came forth from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he go again as he came , and shall take nothing for his la@@ bor , which he may carry away in his hand .
for what advantage has the wise more than the fo@@ ol ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he conten@@ d with him who is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than he .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fo@@ ols is in the house of mir@@ th .
it is better to hear the re@@ bu@@ ke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fo@@ ols .
better is the end of a thing than its beginning . the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , and in the day of ad@@ versity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of van@@ ity : there is a righ@@ te@@ ous man who per@@ is@@ hes in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man who lives long in his ev@@ il@@ doing .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don '@@ t withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wis@@ dom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is st@@ up@@ idity , and that fo@@ ol@@ ishness is mad@@ ness .
which my sou@@ l still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpre@@ tation of a thing ? a man 's wis@@ dom makes his face sh@@ ine , and the hard@@ ness of his face is changed .
for he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried . indeed they came also from hol@@ iness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is van@@ ity .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
though a sin@@ ner comm@@ its crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet su@@ rely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are rever@@ ent before him .
but it shall not be well with the w@@ ic@@ ked , neither shall he leng@@ then days like a shadow ; because he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fear God .
there is a van@@ ity which is done on the ear@@ th , that there are righ@@ te@@ ous men to whom it happens according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked . again , there are w@@ ic@@ ked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous . I said that this also is van@@ ity .
when I applied my heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done on the ear@@ th ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sle@@ ep with his eyes ) ,
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don '@@ t know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y has per@@ ished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion fore@@ ver in anything that is done under the sun .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wis@@ dom , in She@@ ol , where you are going .
for man also do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know his time . as the fish that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are , even so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it falls su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them .
dead f@@ lies cause the oil of the per@@ fu@@ mer to send forth an ev@@ il odor ; so does a little Fol@@ ly out@@ we@@ igh wis@@ dom and hon@@ or .
yes also , when the fo@@ ol walk@@ s by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fo@@ ol .
he who di@@ gs a p@@ it may fall into it ; and who@@ ever breaks through a wall may be bit@@ ten by a sn@@ ake .
the beginning of the words of his m@@ outh is fo@@ ol@@ ishness ; and the end of his talk is mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous mad@@ ness .
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of no@@ bles , and your pr@@ inces eat in due season , for strength , and not for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness !
D@@ on '@@ t cur@@ se the king , no , not in your th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and don '@@ t cur@@ se the rich in your bed@@ room : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has w@@ ings may tell the matter .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the ear@@ th ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
as you don '@@ t know what is the way of the wind , nor how the b@@ ones grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her who is with child ; even so you don '@@ t know the work of God who does all .
in the morning so@@ w your se@@ ed , and in the evening don '@@ t with@@ hold your hand ; for you don '@@ t know which will prosp@@ er , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is swe@@ et , and a pleas@@ ant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him re@@ jo@@ ice in them all ; but let him remember the days of d@@ ark@@ ness , for they shall be many . all that comes is van@@ ity .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of music shall be brought low ;
before the silver cor@@ d is sever@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l is broken , or the pit@@ cher is broken at the spring , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n ,
D@@ on '@@ t st@@ are at me because I am dark , because the sun has scor@@ ched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards . I ha@@ ven '@@ t kept my own v@@ ine@@ yard .
tell me , you whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es , where you gra@@ ze your flock , where you rest them at noon ; For why should I be as one who is ve@@ iled bes@@ ide the f@@ loc@@ ks of your compan@@ ions ? L@@ over
if you don '@@ t know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the she@@ ep . Gra@@ ze your young go@@ ats bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t . be@@ hold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he g@@ lan@@ ces through the lat@@ tice .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed spoke , and said to me , " R@@ ise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve is heard in our land .
the fi@@ g tree ri@@ pen@@ s her green fig@@ s . the v@@ ines are in b@@ los@@ so@@ m . they give forth their fra@@ gr@@ ance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " L@@ over
my do@@ ve in the cle@@ fts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountain@@ side , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is swe@@ et , and your face is lov@@ ely .
until the day is co@@ ol , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , turn , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , and be like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t on the mountains of Be@@ ther .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the s@@ quar@@ es I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
I had scar@@ c@@ ely passed from them , when I found him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , into the room of her who conce@@ ived me .
they all handle the s@@ word , and are expert in war . every man has his s@@ word on his th@@ igh , because of fear in the night .

your te@@ eth are like a newly shor@@ n flock , which have come up from the w@@ ashing , where every one of them has tw@@ ins . none is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed among them .
until the day is co@@ ol , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will go to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
come with me from Lebanon , my bri@@ de , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Sen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the li@@ ons ' den@@ s , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
you have ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart , my sister , my bri@@ de . you have ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your nec@@ k .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bri@@ de ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fra@@ gr@@ ance of your per@@ fu@@ mes than all kinds of sp@@ ices !
your li@@ ps , my bri@@ de , dri@@ p like the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b . hon@@ ey and milk are under your ton@@ gue . the s@@ me@@ ll of your gar@@ ments is like the s@@ me@@ ll of Lebanon .
I have taken off my ro@@ be . indeed , must I put it on ? I have was@@ hed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
I rose up to open for my bel@@ ov@@ ed . my hands dri@@ pped with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , my fin@@ gers with liqu@@ id m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , on the hand@@ les of the lock .
I opened to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; but my bel@@ ov@@ ed left ; and had gone away . my heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him . I called him , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer .
the watch@@ men who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bru@@ ised me . the ke@@ epers of the walls took my clo@@ ak away from me .
how is your bel@@ ov@@ ed better than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , you fa@@ i@@ rest among women ? how is your bel@@ ov@@ ed better than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , that you do so adj@@ ure us ? bel@@ ov@@ ed
my bel@@ ov@@ ed has gone down to his gar@@ den , to the beds of sp@@ ices , to fe@@ ed in the gar@@ den@@ s , and to gather l@@ ilies .
I went down into the n@@ ut tree gro@@ ve , to see the green plants of the val@@ ley , to see whether the v@@ ine bud@@ ded , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were in f@@ lower .
how beautiful are your feet in sand@@ als , pr@@ ince 's daughter ! your ro@@ unded th@@ igh@@ s are like je@@ wel@@ s , the work of the hands of a s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man .
your body is like a round go@@ b@@ let , no mixed wine is wan@@ ting . your wa@@ ist is like a he@@ ap of wheat , set about with l@@ ilies .

let 's go early up to the v@@ ine@@ yards . let 's see whether the v@@ ine has bud@@ ded , its b@@ los@@ so@@ m is open , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates are in f@@ lower . there I will give you my love .
O@@ h that you were like my brother , who nur@@ sed from the bre@@ asts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would k@@ is@@ s you ; yes , and no one would desp@@ ise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me . I would have you drink sp@@ ic@@ ed wine , of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .

the daughter of Z@@ ion is left like a shelter in a v@@ ine@@ yard , like a h@@ ut in a field of mel@@ ons , like a bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed city .
unless Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies had left to us a very small re@@ mn@@ ant , we would have been as So@@ dom ; we would have been like G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h .
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to tr@@ amp@@ le my courts ?
when you spread forth your hands , I will hide my eyes from you . yes , when you make many pray@@ ers , I will not hear . your hands are full of blood .
was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ selves , make yo@@ ur@@ self clean . put away the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings from before my eyes . ce@@ ase to do ev@@ il .
your pr@@ inces are rebel@@ li@@ ous , and compan@@ ions of th@@ i@@ ev@@ es . everyone lov@@ es bribes , and follows after re@@ wards . they don '@@ t judge the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither does the cause of the wi@@ dow come to them .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow to it .
he will judge between the nations , and will decide concerning many peoples ; and they shall beat their s@@ words into p@@ low@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks . nation shall not lift up s@@ word against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
for you have for@@ sak@@ en your people , the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , because they are filled from the east , with those who practice div@@ ination like the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and they clas@@ p hands with the children of foreigners .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots .
their land also is full of id@@ ols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fin@@ gers have made .
enter into the rock , and hide in the d@@ ust , from before the terror of Yah@@ we@@ h , and from the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
the lo@@ f@@ ty looks of man will be brought low , the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men will be bo@@ wed down , and Yah@@ we@@ h alone will be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be brought low ; and Yah@@ we@@ h alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
the people will be op@@ pressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neigh@@ bor . the child will be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the old man , and the base against the hon@@ or@@ able .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clo@@ thing , you be our ru@@ ler , and let this ru@@ in be under your hand . "
in that day he will cry out , saying , " I will not be a he@@ al@@ er ; for in my house is neither bread nor clo@@ thing . you shall not make me ru@@ ler of the people . "
Wo@@ e to the w@@ ic@@ ked ! disaster is upon them ; for the de@@ eds of his hands will be paid back to him .
moreover Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Bec@@ ause the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion are ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and walk with out@@ stret@@ ched nec@@ ks and f@@ li@@ r@@ ting eyes , walk@@ ing to trip as they go , j@@ ing@@ ling or@@ nam@@ ents on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings so@@ res on the cro@@ wn of the head of the women of Z@@ ion , and Yah@@ we@@ h will make their scal@@ ps bal@@ d . "
it shall happen that instead of swe@@ et sp@@ ices , there shall be rot@@ ten@@ ness ; instead of a bel@@ t , a ro@@ pe ; instead of well set ha@@ ir , bal@@ d@@ ness ; instead of a ro@@ be , a wearing of s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; and br@@ anding instead of beauty .
it will happen , that he who is left in Z@@ ion , and he who remains in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even everyone who is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem ;
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from its mid@@ st , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grap@@ es , did it yield wild grap@@ es ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard . I will take away its h@@ edge , and it will be e@@ aten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tr@@ amp@@ led down .
I will lay it a was@@ te@@ land . it won '@@ t be pr@@ un@@ ed nor ho@@ ed , but it will grow bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns . I will also command the cl@@ ou@@ ds that they rain no rain on it . "
for the v@@ ine@@ yard of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is the house of Israel , and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h his pleas@@ ant plant : and he looked for justice , but , be@@ hold , op@@ pression ; for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but , be@@ hold , a cry of dist@@ ress .
Wo@@ e to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to d@@ well alone in the mid@@ st of the land !
Wo@@ e to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inf@@ la@@ mes them !
the har@@ p , Ly@@ re , tam@@ bour@@ ine , and fl@@ ute , with wine , are at their fe@@ asts ; but they don '@@ t respect the work of Yah@@ we@@ h , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore She@@ ol has en@@ lar@@ ged its desire , and opened its m@@ outh without measure ; and their gl@@ ory , their multi@@ tude , their pom@@ p , and he who re@@ jo@@ ices among them , des@@ cen@@ d into it .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him has@@ ten his work , that we may see it ; and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a ban@@ ner to the nations from far , and he will wh@@ ist@@ le for them from the end of the ear@@ th . be@@ hold , they will come spe@@ edil@@ y and swi@@ f@@ tly .
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the bel@@ t of their wa@@ ist be un@@ tied , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
their ro@@ aring will be like a li@@ on@@ ess . they will ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons . yes , they shall ro@@ ar , and se@@ ize their pre@@ y and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
they will ro@@ ar against them in that day like the ro@@ aring of the sea . if one looks to the land be@@ hold , d@@ ark@@ ness and dist@@ ress . the light is dar@@ ken@@ ed in its cl@@ ou@@ ds .
in the year that king Uz@@ zi@@ ah died , I saw the Lord sitting on a th@@ r@@ one , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temp@@ le .
then one of the ser@@ ap@@ him fle@@ w to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the ton@@ gs from off the alt@@ ar .
he touched my m@@ outh with it , and said , " be@@ hold , this has touched your li@@ ps ; and your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is taken away , and your sin for@@ given . "
make the heart of this people f@@ at . make their e@@ ars heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and understand with their heart , and turn again , and be he@@ aled . "
and Yah@@ we@@ h has removed men far away , and the for@@ sak@@ en places are many in the mid@@ st of the land .
if there is a tenth left in it , that also will in turn be consu@@ med : as a ter@@ eb@@ inth , and as an o@@ ak , whose stock remains when they are fel@@ led ; so the hol@@ y se@@ ed is its stock . "
it happened in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up to Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is al@@ lied with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . " his heart tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tre@@ m@@ ble with the wind .
then Yah@@ we@@ h said to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , " G@@ o out now to meet A@@ haz , you , and S@@ hear@@ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b your son , at the end of the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , on the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
" let 's go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its mid@@ st , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ el . "
for the head of Syria is Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the head of Dam@@ as@@ cus is Re@@ z@@ in ; and within six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be broken in pieces , so that it shall not be a people ;
and the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is Samar@@ ia , and the head of Samar@@ ia is Rem@@ ali@@ ah 's son . if you will not believe , su@@ rely you shall not be established . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im depar@@ ted from Ju@@ da@@ h ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
it will happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will wh@@ ist@@ le for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , in the cle@@ fts of the ro@@ cks , on all Th@@ or@@ n h@@ ed@@ ges , and on all pas@@ tures .
in that day the Lord will s@@ have with a ra@@ zor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head and the ha@@ ir of the feet ; and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two she@@ ep ;
and it shall happen , that because of the ab@@ und@@ ance of milk which they shall give he shall eat but@@ ter : for everyone will eat but@@ ter and hon@@ ey that is left in the mid@@ st of the land .
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand silver sh@@ ek@@ els , shall be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
all the hil@@ ls that were cultiv@@ ated with the ho@@ e , you shall not come there for fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of she@@ ep . "
for before the child knows how to say , ' My father , ' and , ' My mother , ' the ri@@ ches of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the sp@@ oil of Samar@@ ia will be carried away by the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord brings upon them the m@@ igh@@ ty flood waters of the River : the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and all his gl@@ ory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
take coun@@ sel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yah@@ we@@ h spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" D@@ on '@@ t say , ' A con@@ spir@@ acy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A con@@ spir@@ acy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terror@@ ized .
Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is who you must respect as hol@@ y . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dre@@ ad .
I will wait for Yah@@ we@@ h , who hi@@ des his face from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and I will look for him .
when they tell you , " cons@@ ult with those who have familiar spir@@ its and with the w@@ iz@@ ards , who ch@@ ir@@ p and who mut@@ ter : " sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t a people cons@@ ult with their God ? should they cons@@ ult the dead on behalf of the living ?
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don '@@ t speak according to this word , su@@ rely there is no morning for them .
they will pass through it , very dist@@ ressed and hun@@ gry ; and it will happen that when they are hun@@ gry , they will worry , and cur@@ se by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces up@@ ward ,
the people who walked in d@@ ark@@ ness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has sh@@ ined .
for all the arm@@ or of the armed man in the no@@ is@@ y battle , and the gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his sho@@ ul@@ ders . his name will be called W@@ on@@ der@@ ful , coun@@ sel@@ or , m@@ igh@@ ty God , Ever@@ lasting F@@ ather , Prince of Peace .
for w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess bur@@ ns like a fire . it dev@@ ours the bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; yes , it kin@@ d@@ les in the th@@ ic@@ kets of the forest , and they rol@@ l up@@ ward in a col@@ umn of smoke .
through the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the land is bur@@ n@@ t up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spar@@ es his brother .
one will dev@@ our on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
Wo@@ e to those who decree un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous decre@@ es , and to the writers who write op@@ pres@@ sive decre@@ es ;
what will you do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which will come from af@@ ar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
however he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Z@@ ion and on Jer@@ usalem , I will punish the fruit of the will@@ ful proud heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the in@@ sol@@ ence of his ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty looks .
should an ax@@ e bra@@ g against him who ch@@ ops with it ? should a saw ex@@ alt itself above him who sa@@ ws with it ? as if a ro@@ d should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
therefore the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , will send among his f@@ at ones le@@ ann@@ ess ; and under his gl@@ ory a burning will be kin@@ d@@ led like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me ; and it will bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day .
he will consum@@ e the gl@@ ory of his forest , and of his fruit@@ ful field , both sou@@ l and body . it will be as when a standard be@@ ar@@ er fa@@ ints .
it will come to pass in that day that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will no more again le@@ an on him who struck them , but shall le@@ an on Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
for yet a very little while , and the in@@ dign@@ ation against you will be accomplished , and my an@@ ger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will de@@ part from off your sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
this very day he will halt at No@@ b . he shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Z@@ ion , the hill of Jer@@ usalem .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h will rest on him : the spirit of wis@@ dom and understanding , the spirit of coun@@ sel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h .
his de@@ light will be in the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his e@@ ars ;
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness he will judge the poor , and decide with equ@@ ity for the hum@@ ble of the ear@@ th . he will strike the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh ; and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps he will kill the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the w@@ ol@@ f will live with the lam@@ b , and the Le@@ op@@ ard will lie down with the young go@@ at ; The cal@@ f , the young lion , and the f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f together ; and a little child will lead them .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of J@@ es@@ se , who stands as a ban@@ ner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be g@@ lor@@ ious .
he will set up a ban@@ ner for the nations , and will assem@@ ble the out@@ casts of Israel , and gather together the disper@@ sed of Ju@@ da@@ h from the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th .
the en@@ v@@ y also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will de@@ part , and those who persec@@ ute Ju@@ da@@ h will be cut off . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im won '@@ t en@@ v@@ y Ju@@ da@@ h , and Ju@@ da@@ h won '@@ t persec@@ ute E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
they will fly down on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines on the west . together they will pl@@ under the children of the east . they will extend their power over E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon will obe@@ y them .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Y@@ ah , Yah@@ we@@ h , is my strength and song ; and he has become my sal@@ vation . "
set up a ban@@ ner on the b@@ are mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the no@@ bles .
I have comman@@ ded my consec@@ rated ones ; yes , I have called my m@@ igh@@ ty men for my an@@ ger , even my pro@@ u@@ dly ex@@ ulting ones .
the no@@ ise of a multi@@ tude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the no@@ ise of an u@@ pro@@ ar of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the nations gathered together ! Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is mu@@ ster@@ ing the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of heav@@ en , even Yah@@ we@@ h , and the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation , to destroy the whole land .
they will be dis@@ may@@ ed . pan@@ gs and sor@@ ro@@ ws will se@@ ize them . they will be in p@@ ain like a woman in la@@ bor . they will look in amaz@@ ement one at another . their faces will be faces of fla@@ me .
be@@ hold , the day of Yah@@ we@@ h comes , cru@@ el , with wr@@ ath and fierce an@@ ger ; to make the land a de@@ so@@ lation , and to destroy its sin@@ ners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations will not give their light . the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to sh@@ ine .
I will punish the world for their ev@@ il , and the w@@ ic@@ ked for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . I will cause the ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance of the proud to ce@@ ase , and will hum@@ ble the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
therefore I will make the heav@@ ens tre@@ m@@ ble , and the ear@@ th will be shaken out of its place in the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , and in the day of his fierce an@@ ger .
it will happen that like a hun@@ ted gaz@@ elle , and like she@@ ep that no one ga@@ thers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their inf@@ ants also will be d@@ ashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be r@@ ans@@ acked , and their wi@@ ves ra@@ ped .
be@@ hold , I will stir up the Me@@ des against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not de@@ light in it .
their bo@@ ws will d@@ ash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b . their eyes will not spar@@ e children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Ara@@ bi@@ an will not pit@@ ch a tent there , neither will she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their f@@ loc@@ ks lie down there .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will have comp@@ as@@ sion on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreig@@ ner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will poss@@ ess them in Yah@@ we@@ h 's land for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids . they will take as cap@@ tives those whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
it will happen in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sor@@ row , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
your pom@@ p is brought down to She@@ ol , with the sound of your str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . Mag@@ go@@ ts are spread out under you , and wor@@ ms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will as@@ cen@@ d into heav@@ en ! I will ex@@ alt my th@@ r@@ one above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
you will not join them in bur@@ ial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers will not be named fore@@ ver .
prepare for sla@@ ughter of his children because of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of their fa@@ thers , that they not rise up and poss@@ ess the ear@@ th , and fill the sur@@ face of the world with cities .
" I will also make it a possession for the por@@ c@@ up@@ ine , and po@@ ols of water . I will swe@@ ep it with the Bro@@ om of destruction , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has sworn , saying , " su@@ rely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have pur@@ posed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot on my mountains . then his yok@@ e will leave them , and his burden leave their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
D@@ on '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice , O Phil@@ isti@@ a , all of you , because the ro@@ d that struck you is broken ; for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root an ad@@ der will emerge , and his fruit will be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor will eat , and the ne@@ edy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with fam@@ ine , and your re@@ mn@@ ant will be killed .
they have gone up to Bay@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , to the high places , to we@@ ep . Mo@@ a@@ b w@@ ails over N@@ eb@@ o and over M@@ ede@@ ba . Bal@@ d@@ ness is on all of their heads . every be@@ ard is cut off .
H@@ es@@ h@@ bon cri@@ es out with Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h . their voice is heard even to Ja@@ haz . therefore the armed men of Mo@@ a@@ b cry al@@ oud . their so@@ ul@@ s tre@@ m@@ ble within them .
my heart cri@@ es out for Mo@@ a@@ b ! her no@@ bles flee to Zo@@ ar , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah ; for they go up by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim will be de@@ so@@ late ; for the gr@@ ass has with@@ ered away , the tender gr@@ ass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the ab@@ und@@ ance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Bro@@ ok of the w@@ il@@ lows .
for the waters of Dim@@ on are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dim@@ on , a lion on those of Mo@@ a@@ b who escape , and on the re@@ mn@@ ant of the land .
for it will be that as w@@ and@@ ering birds , as a sc@@ at@@ tered n@@ est , so will the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Mo@@ a@@ b be at the for@@ ds of the Ar@@ non .
a th@@ r@@ one will be established in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , jud@@ ging , seeking justice , and swift to do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b , that he is very proud ; even of his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , his pride , and his wr@@ ath . his bo@@ ast@@ ings are nothing .
for the fields of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon langu@@ ish with the v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h . the lor@@ ds of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jaz@@ er , which w@@ and@@ ered into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . its sho@@ ots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
therefore I will we@@ ep with the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er for the v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h . I will water you with my te@@ ars , H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : for on your summer fru@@ its and on your har@@ v@@ est the battle sh@@ out has fallen .
it will happen that when Mo@@ a@@ b presents himself , when he we@@ aries himself on the high place , and comes to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y , that he will not prev@@ ail .
the cities of A@@ ro@@ er are for@@ sak@@ en . they will be for f@@ loc@@ ks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall ce@@ ase from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the k@@ ing@@ dom from Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Syria . they will be as the gl@@ ory of the children of Israel , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
" it will happen in that day that the gl@@ ory of Jac@@ o@@ b will be made th@@ in , and the fat@@ ness of his f@@ les@@ h will become le@@ an .
it will be like when the har@@ ves@@ ter ga@@ thers the wheat , and his arm re@@ aps the gra@@ in . yes , it will be like when one g@@ le@@ ans gra@@ in in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
in that day , people will look to their Mak@@ er , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fin@@ gers have made , either the Ash@@ er@@ im , or the incen@@ se al@@ tar@@ s .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the for@@ sak@@ en places in the wo@@ ods and on the mountain top , which were for@@ sak@@ en from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a de@@ so@@ lation .
in the day of your plan@@ ting , you h@@ edge it in . in the morning , you make your se@@ ed b@@ los@@ so@@ m , but the har@@ v@@ est fle@@ es away in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
A@@ h , the u@@ pro@@ ar of many peoples , who ro@@ ar like the ro@@ aring of the seas ; and the rus@@ hing of nations , that rush like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
the nations will rush like the rus@@ hing of many waters : but he will re@@ bu@@ ke them , and they will flee far off , and will be ch@@ ased like the c@@ haf@@ f of the mountains before the wind , and like the wh@@ ir@@ ling d@@ ust before the storm .
at evening , be@@ hold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who pl@@ under us , and the lot of those who ro@@ b us .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you d@@ wel@@ lers on the ear@@ th , when a ban@@ ner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the tr@@ ump@@ et is blo@@ wn , listen !
for before the har@@ v@@ est , when the b@@ los@@ so@@ m is over , and the f@@ lower becomes a ri@@ pen@@ ing gra@@ pe , he will cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
they will be left together for the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of the mountains , and for the animals of the ear@@ th . the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds will summer on them , and all the animals of the ear@@ th will winter on them .
the burden of Egypt : " be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h ri@@ des on a swift cl@@ oud , and comes to Egypt . the id@@ ols of Egypt will tre@@ m@@ ble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will mel@@ t in its mid@@ st .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its mid@@ st . I will destroy its coun@@ sel . they will seek the id@@ ols , the char@@ mers , those who have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards .
the rivers will become f@@ oul . the stre@@ ams of Egypt will be dimin@@ ished and dri@@ ed up . the re@@ eds and flags will wi@@ ther away .
the me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws by the N@@ ile , by the br@@ ink of the N@@ ile , and all the so@@ wn fields of the N@@ ile , will become d@@ ry , be driven away , and be no more .
the pil@@ lars will be broken in pieces . all those who work for h@@ ire will be gri@@ ev@@ ed in sou@@ l .
the pr@@ inces of Zo@@ an have become fo@@ ols . the pr@@ inces of Mem@@ p@@ his are dec@@ e@@ ived . they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y , who are the cor@@ ner@@ stone of her tri@@ bes .
Yah@@ we@@ h has mixed a spirit of per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in the mid@@ st of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y in all of its works , like a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ gers in his v@@ om@@ it .
in that day the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will be like women . they will tre@@ m@@ ble and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Ju@@ da@@ h will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he determin@@ es against it .
in that day , there will be an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h in the mid@@ st of the land of Egypt , and a pil@@ lar to Yah@@ we@@ h at its border .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h because of op@@ pres@@ sors , and he will send them a Sav@@ ior and a def@@ ender , and he will deliver them .
Yah@@ we@@ h will be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will know Yah@@ we@@ h in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h , and will perform it .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will worship with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans .
so the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a will lead away the cap@@ tives of Egypt and the ex@@ il@@ es of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , young and old , nak@@ ed and bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot , and with but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the sh@@ ame of Egypt .
therefore my th@@ igh@@ s are filled with an@@ gu@@ ish . pain@@ s have taken hold on me , like the pain@@ s of a woman in la@@ bor . I am in so much p@@ ain that I can '@@ t hear . I so am dis@@ may@@ ed that I can '@@ t see .
you are my th@@ res@@ hing , and the gra@@ in of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
for they fled away from the s@@ words , from the drawn s@@ word , from the b@@ ent bo@@ w , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " With@@ in a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the gl@@ ory of K@@ ed@@ ar will fail ,
and the resi@@ due of the number of the ar@@ chers , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of the children of K@@ ed@@ ar , will be few ; for Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
he took away the covering of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and you looked in that day to the arm@@ or in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
you also made a reser@@ vo@@ ir between the two walls for the water of the old pool . but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t look to him who had done this , neither did you have respect for him who pur@@ posed it long ago .
'@@ What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have du@@ g out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , ch@@ is@@ el@@ ing a habi@@ tation for himself in the rock ! "
he will su@@ rely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the char@@ i@@ ots of your gl@@ ory will be , you sh@@ ame of your lor@@ d 's house .
and I will clo@@ the him with your ro@@ be , and strengthen him with your bel@@ t . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his sho@@ ul@@ der . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fas@@ ten him like a na@@ il in a sure place . he will be for a th@@ r@@ one of gl@@ ory to his father 's house .
they will han@@ g on him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , every small ves@@ sel , from the c@@ ups even to all the pit@@ chers .
the burden of T@@ y@@ re . H@@ ow@@ l , you ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kit@@ tim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the mer@@ chan@@ ts of S@@ id@@ on , that pass over the sea , have rep@@ len@@ ished .
he has stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms . Yah@@ we@@ h has ordered the destruction of Can@@ a@@ an 's stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
it will come to pass in that day that T@@ y@@ re will be forgotten sev@@ enty years , according to the days of one king . after the end of sev@@ enty years it will be to T@@ y@@ re like in the song of the pro@@ stitute .
it will happen after the end of sev@@ enty years that Yah@@ we@@ h will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
for it will be so in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th among the peoples , as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
it will happen that he who fle@@ es from the no@@ ise of the fear will fall into the p@@ it ; and he who comes up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it will be taken in the sn@@ are ; for the windows on high are opened , and the foundations of the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ ble .
the ear@@ th will stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and will s@@ way back and forth like a ham@@ mo@@ ck . its dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th on the ear@@ th .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
Yah@@ we@@ h , you are my God . I will ex@@ alt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done won@@ der@@ ful things , things planned long ago , in complete fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and truth .
as the heat in a d@@ ry place will you bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers ; as the heat by the sha@@ de of a cl@@ oud , the song of the dre@@ aded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies will make all peoples a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of choice win@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of well refin@@ ed choice win@@ es .
he has sw@@ allowed up death fore@@ ver ! the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces . he will take the re@@ pro@@ ach of his people away from off all the ear@@ th , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " be@@ hold , this is our God ! we have w@@ aited for him , and he will save us ! this is Yah@@ we@@ h ! we have w@@ aited for him . we will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in his sal@@ vation ! "
for in this mountain the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h will rest . Mo@@ a@@ b will be tro@@ dden down in his place , even like stra@@ w is tro@@ dden down in the water of the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
he will spread out his hands in its mid@@ st , like one who sw@@ ims sp@@ reads out hands to sw@@ im , but his pride will be hum@@ b@@ led together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
for he has brought down those who d@@ well on high , the lo@@ f@@ ty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the d@@ ust .
yes , in the way of your judg@@ ments , Yah@@ we@@ h , have we w@@ aited for you . your name and your ren@@ own are the desire of our sou@@ l .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly ; for when your judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let fav@@ or be shown to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet he will not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness he will deal wrong@@ fully , and will not see Yah@@ we@@ h 's maj@@ es@@ ty .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in p@@ ain and cri@@ es out in her pan@@ gs ; so we have been before you , Yah@@ we@@ h .
we have been with child . we have been in p@@ ain . we gave birth , it seems , only to wind . we have not worked any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yo@@ ur@@ self for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation is past .
for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the ear@@ th for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . the ear@@ th also will disclose her blood , and will no longer cover her sla@@ in .
wr@@ ath is not in me , but if I should find bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns , I would do battle ! I would march on them and I would bur@@ n them together .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in days to come , Jac@@ o@@ b will take root . Israel will b@@ los@@ so@@ m and bu@@ d . they will fill the sur@@ face of the world with fruit .
in measure , when you send them away , you conten@@ d with them . he has removed them with his roug@@ h blast in the day of the east wind .
for the for@@ ti@@ fied city is sol@@ itary , a habi@@ tation de@@ ser@@ ted and for@@ sak@@ en , like the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . the cal@@ f will fe@@ ed there , and there he will lie down , and consum@@ e its branches .
when its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are with@@ ered , they will be broken off . the women will come and set them on fire , for they are a people of no understanding . therefore he who made them will not have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and he who formed them will show them no fav@@ or .
it will happen in that day , that Yah@@ we@@ h will th@@ res@@ h from the flow@@ ing stream of the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates to the Bro@@ ok of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Wo@@ e to the cro@@ wn of pride of the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and to the f@@ ading f@@ lower of his g@@ lor@@ ious beauty , which is on the head of the fer@@ tile val@@ ley of those who are overcome with wine !
be@@ hold , the Lord has a m@@ igh@@ ty and strong one . like a storm of ha@@ il , a destroying storm , and like a storm of m@@ igh@@ ty waters over@@ flow@@ ing , he will cast them down to the ear@@ th with his hand .
they also reel with wine , and stag@@ ger with strong drink . the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t reel with strong drink . they are sw@@ allowed up by wine . they stag@@ ger with strong drink . they er@@ r in vision . they st@@ um@@ ble in judgment .
I will make justice the measuring line , and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness the Pl@@ um@@ b line . the ha@@ il will swe@@ ep away the ref@@ uge of lies , and the waters will over@@ flow the hiding place .
your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with She@@ ol shall not stand . when the over@@ flow@@ ing s@@ cour@@ ge passes through , then you will be tr@@ amp@@ led down by it .
as often as it passes through , it will se@@ ize you ; for morning by morning it will pass through , by day and by night ; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message . "
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the b@@ lan@@ ket is too narrow to wrap on@@ es@@ el@@ f in .
when he has lev@@ eled its sur@@ face , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he plant the d@@ ill , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ in se@@ ed , and put in the wheat in ro@@ ws , the bar@@ ley in the appointed place , and the sp@@ el@@ t in its place ?
for the d@@ ill are not th@@ res@@ hed with a sharp instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned over the cum@@ in ; but the d@@ ill is beaten out with a stick , and the cum@@ in with a ro@@ d .
bread fl@@ our must be ground ; so he will not always be th@@ res@@ hing it . although he dri@@ ves the whe@@ el of his th@@ res@@ hing c@@ art over it , his hor@@ ses don '@@ t gr@@ ind it .
I will en@@ camp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
you will be brought down , and will speak out of the ground . your speech will m@@ um@@ ble out of the d@@ ust . your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and your speech will wh@@ is@@ per out of the d@@ ust .
but the multi@@ tude of your fo@@ es will be like fine d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ru@@ th@@ less ones like c@@ haf@@ f that blo@@ ws away . yes , it will be in an in@@ stan@@ t , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
for Yah@@ we@@ h has p@@ oured out on you a spirit of deep sle@@ ep , and has closed your eyes , the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; and he has covered your heads , the se@@ ers .
the Lord said , " Bec@@ ause this people draws near with their m@@ outh and with their li@@ ps to hon@@ or me , but they have removed their heart far from me , and their fear of me is a comman@@ d@@ ment of men which has been ta@@ ught ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will proceed to do a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous work among this people , even a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous work and a wonder ; and the wis@@ dom of their wise men will per@@ ish , and the understanding of their pru@@ dent men will be hidden . "
Is@@ n '@@ t it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the de@@ af will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d will see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
the hum@@ ble also will increase their joy in Yah@@ we@@ h , and the poor among men will re@@ jo@@ ice in the Holy One of Israel .
but when he sees his children , the work of my hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name . yes , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and will stand in a@@ we of the God of Israel .
who set out to go down into Egypt , and have not asked my advice ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to take ref@@ uge in the shadow of Egypt !
therefore this in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , s@@ wel@@ ling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes su@@ d@@ den@@ ly in an in@@ stan@@ t .
he will break it as a P@@ ot@@ ter 's ves@@ sel is broken , breaking it in pieces without spar@@ ing , so that there won '@@ t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the Hear@@ th , or to dip up water out of the c@@ ister@@ n . "
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a be@@ ac@@ on on the top of a mountain , and like a ban@@ ner on a hill .
for the people will d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem . you will we@@ ep no more . he will su@@ rely be gr@@ ac@@ ious to you at the voice of your cry . when he he@@ ars you , he will answer you .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your e@@ ars will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ lay@@ ing of your en@@ gra@@ ved images of silver , and the pla@@ ting of your m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " G@@ o away ! "
he will give the rain for your se@@ ed , with which you will so@@ w the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plen@@ ti@@ ful . in that day , your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck will fe@@ ed in large pas@@ tures .
the ox@@ en likewise and the young don@@ ke@@ ys that ti@@ ll the ground will eat sav@@ ory pro@@ ven@@ der , which has been win@@ no@@ wed with the sh@@ ov@@ el and with the for@@ k .
there shall be bro@@ oks and stre@@ ams of water on every lo@@ f@@ ty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
be@@ hold , the name of Yah@@ we@@ h comes from far away , burning with his an@@ ger , and in th@@ ick rising smoke . his li@@ ps are full of in@@ dign@@ ation , and his ton@@ gue is as a dev@@ our@@ ing fire .
his bre@@ ath is as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream that reaches even to the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of destruction ; and a bri@@ dle that leads to ru@@ in will be in the j@@ a@@ ws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y feast is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Yah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cause his g@@ lor@@ ious voice to be heard , and will show the des@@ cent of his arm , with the in@@ dign@@ ation of his an@@ ger , and the fla@@ me of a dev@@ our@@ ing fire , with a blast , storm , and ha@@ il@@ stones .
every stro@@ ke of the ro@@ d of punishment , which Yah@@ we@@ h will lay on him , will be with the sound of tam@@ bour@@ ines and har@@ ps . he will fight with them in batt@@ les , br@@ and@@ ishing weapons .
Wo@@ e to those who go down to Egypt for help , and rely on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots because they are many , and in hor@@ se@@ men because they are very strong , but they don '@@ t look to the Holy One of Israel , and they don '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h !
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of those who work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
now the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are men , and not God ; and their hor@@ ses f@@ les@@ h , and not spirit . when Yah@@ we@@ h stret@@ ches out his hand , both he who helps shall st@@ um@@ ble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consu@@ med together .
for in that day everyone shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver and his id@@ ols of gol@@ d@@ -@@ -@@ sin which your own hands have made for you .
" the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an will fall by the s@@ word , not of man ; and the s@@ word , not of man@@ kind , shall dev@@ our him . he will flee from the s@@ word , and his young men will become subject to forced la@@ bor .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the storm , as stre@@ ams of water in a d@@ ry place , as the sha@@ de of a large rock in a we@@ ary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the e@@ ars of those who hear will listen .
at the no@@ ise of the Th@@ under , the peoples have fled . when you lift yo@@ ur@@ self up , the nations are sc@@ at@@ tered .
he will d@@ well on high . his place of defen@@ se will be the fortress of ro@@ cks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can '@@ t compre@@ hend , with a st@@ range language that you can '@@ t understand .
your ri@@ gging is un@@ tied . they co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t strengthen the fo@@ ot of their m@@ ast . they co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t spread the sa@@ il . then the pre@@ y of a great sp@@ oil was divided . the la@@ me took the pre@@ y .
for Yah@@ we@@ h is en@@ ra@@ ged against all the nations , and angry with all their armies . he has ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them . he has given them over for sla@@ ughter .
their sla@@ in will also be cast out , and the st@@ en@@ ch of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will mel@@ t in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dis@@ solved . the sky will be rol@@ led up like a s@@ cr@@ oll , and all its armies will fade away , as a le@@ af f@@ ades from off a v@@ ine or a fi@@ g tree .
the wild ox@@ en will come down with them , and the young bul@@ ls with the m@@ igh@@ ty bul@@ ls ; and their land will be dr@@ un@@ ken with blood , and their d@@ ust made gre@@ asy with f@@ at .
it won '@@ t be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day . its smoke will go up fore@@ ver . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it fore@@ ver and ever .
but the p@@ el@@ ic@@ an and the por@@ c@@ up@@ ine will poss@@ ess it . the ow@@ l and the ra@@ ven will d@@ well in it . he will stretch the line of conf@@ usion over it , and the Pl@@ um@@ b line of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
they shall call its no@@ bles to the k@@ ing@@ dom , but none shall be there ; and all its pr@@ inces shall be nothing .
thor@@ ns will come up in its pal@@ aces , net@@ t@@ les and th@@ ist@@ les in its for@@ t@@ resses ; and it will be a habi@@ tation of j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s , a court for os@@ tri@@ ches .
the wild animals of the de@@ sert will meet with the w@@ ol@@ ves , and the wild go@@ at will cry to his fellow . yes , the night cre@@ ature shall settle there , and shall find her@@ self a place of rest .
the ar@@ row sn@@ ake will make her n@@ est there , and lay , Hat@@ ch , and gather under her sha@@ de . yes , the ki@@ tes will be gathered there , every one with her M@@ ate .
he has cast the lot for them , and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line . they shall poss@@ ess it fore@@ ver . from generation to generation they will d@@ well in it .
it will b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's gl@@ ory Lebanon will be given to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on . they will see Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of our God .
then the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d will be opened , and the e@@ ars of the de@@ af will be un@@ stopped .
then the la@@ me man will le@@ ap like a de@@ er , and the ton@@ gue of the m@@ ute will sing ; for waters will break out in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and stre@@ ams in the de@@ sert .
the burning s@@ and will become a pool , and the thir@@ st@@ y ground spr@@ ings of water . gr@@ ass with re@@ eds and rus@@ hes will be in the habi@@ tation of j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s , where they lay .
the Yah@@ we@@ h 's ran@@ so@@ med ones will return , and come with singing to Z@@ ion ; and ever@@ lasting joy will be on their heads . they will obtain gla@@ d@@ ness and joy , and sor@@ row and si@@ gh@@ ing will flee away . "
now it happened in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a attacked all of the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and captured them .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jer@@ usalem to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a large army . he stood by the aqu@@ educ@@ t from the up@@ per pool in the ful@@ ler 's field highway .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of A@@ sap@@ h , the rec@@ order came out to him .
I say that your coun@@ sel and strength for the war are only v@@ ain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebel@@ led against me ?
be@@ hold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even in Egypt , which if a man le@@ ans on it , it will go into his hand and Pi@@ erce it . so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
now therefore , ple@@ ase make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and called out with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a !
D@@ on '@@ t let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us . this city won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . " '
be@@ w@@ are lest H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will deliver us . " have any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of A@@ sap@@ h , the rec@@ order , came to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
it happened , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
he heard news concerning Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , " Jer@@ usalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , Har@@ an , Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den who were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers and read it . then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and spread it before Yah@@ we@@ h .
" Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , who is en@@ th@@ ron@@ ed among the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , you are the God , even you alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th . you have made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you de@@ fied and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? against whom have you ex@@ al@@ ted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to destroy for@@ ti@@ fied cities , turning them into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded . they were like the gr@@ ass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like a field before its cro@@ p has grown .
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came .
this shall be the sign to you . you will eat this year that which gro@@ ws of itself , and in the second year that which spr@@ ings from the same ; and in the third year so@@ w and re@@ ap and plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and eat their fruit .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , ' He will not come to this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , neither will he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mo@@ und against it .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons struck him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Ar@@ ar@@ at . E@@ sar H@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
in those days was H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah si@@ ck and near death . I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , came to him , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' S@@ et your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Re@@ member now , Yah@@ we@@ h , I be@@ g you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
" go , and tell H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , " I have heard your pray@@ er . I have seen your te@@ ars . be@@ hold , I will add fif@@ teen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h will do this thing that he has spoken .
be@@ hold , I will cause the shadow on the sun@@ di@@ al , which has gone down on the sun@@ di@@ al of A@@ haz with the sun , to return back@@ ward ten steps . so the sun returned ten steps on the sun@@ di@@ al on which it had gone down . " ' "
the writing of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , when he had been si@@ ck , and had recovered of his si@@ ck@@ ness .
my d@@ wel@@ ling is removed , and is carried away from me like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent . I have rol@@ led up , like a we@@ av@@ er , my life . he will cut me off from the lo@@ om . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the an@@ gu@@ ish of my sou@@ l .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great an@@ gu@@ ish , but you have in love for my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption ; for you have cast all my sin@@ s behind your back .
Yah@@ we@@ h will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
now I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had said , " Let them take a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and lay it for a poul@@ tice on the bo@@ il , and he shall rec@@ over . "
at that time , Mer@@ od@@ ach Bal@@ adan the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah ; for he heard that he had been si@@ ck , and had recovered .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing will be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's palace . ' "
" speak comfor@@ tably to Jer@@ usalem ; and call out to her that her war@@ fare is accomplished , that her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ don@@ ed , that she has received of Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand double for all her sin@@ s . "
be@@ hold , the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will come as a m@@ igh@@ ty one , and his arm will rule for him . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him .
he will fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d . he will gather the lam@@ bs in his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om . he will g@@ ently lead those who have their young .
who has meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and marked off the sky with his sp@@ an , and calculated the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
who did he take coun@@ sel with , and who instruc@@ ted him , and ta@@ ught him in the path of justice , and ta@@ ught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
be@@ hold , the nations are like a drop in a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are regarded as a spec@@ k of d@@ ust on a balance . be@@ hold , he lif@@ ts up the islands like a very little thing .
he who is too imp@@ over@@ ished for such an offering choos@@ es a tree that will not ro@@ t . he seeks a s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man to set up an en@@ gra@@ ved image for him that will not be moved .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you known ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard , yet ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you been told from the beginning ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you understood from the foundations of the ear@@ th ?
it is he who s@@ its above the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and its inhabitants are like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens like a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ reads them out like a tent to d@@ well in ;
they are plan@@ ted scar@@ c@@ ely . they are so@@ wn scar@@ c@@ ely . their stock has scar@@ c@@ ely taken root in the ground . he mer@@ ely blo@@ ws on them , and they wi@@ ther , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind takes them away as st@@ ub@@ ble .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you known ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard ? the ever@@ lasting God , Yah@@ we@@ h , The Cre@@ ator of the ends of the ear@@ th , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fa@@ int . he is@@ n '@@ t we@@ ary . his understanding is un@@ sear@@ cha@@ ble .
but those who wait for Yah@@ we@@ h will ren@@ ew their strength . they will mount up with w@@ ings like e@@ ag@@ les . they will run , and not be we@@ ary . they will walk , and not fa@@ int .
he pursu@@ es them , and passes by saf@@ ely , E@@ ven by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
so the car@@ pen@@ ter encour@@ ages the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h . he who smoo@@ th@@ es with the ham@@ mer encour@@ ages him who strikes the an@@ vil , saying of the sol@@ dering , " It is good " ; and he fas@@ tens it with n@@ ails , that it might not tot@@ ter .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called from its cor@@ ners , and said to you , ' You are my ser@@ vant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
D@@ on '@@ t you be afraid , for I am with you . D@@ on '@@ t be dis@@ may@@ ed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you . yes , I will help you . yes , I will up@@ hold you with the right hand of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
be@@ hold , all those who are incen@@ sed against you will be disappointed and con@@ founded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall per@@ ish .
you will seek them , and won '@@ t find them , even those who conten@@ d with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @@@ -@@ @ ex@@ istent thing .
for I , Yah@@ we@@ h your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . I will help you . '
you will win@@ now them , and the wind will carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind will sc@@ at@@ ter them . you will re@@ jo@@ ice in Yah@@ we@@ h . you will gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers on the b@@ are he@@ ights , and spr@@ ings in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s . I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
" let them announce , and declare to us what shall happen . declare the former things , what they are , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or show us things to come .
be@@ hold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who choos@@ es you is an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rul@@ ers as on mort@@ ar , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter t@@ reads cla@@ y .
who has declared it from the beginning , that we may know ? and before , that we may say , ' He is right ? ' su@@ rely , there is no one who declar@@ es . su@@ rely , there is no one who shows . su@@ rely , there is no one who he@@ ars your words .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no coun@@ sel@@ or who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
" be@@ hold , my ser@@ vant , whom I up@@ hold ; my chosen , in whom my sou@@ l deli@@ gh@@ ts@@ -- I have put my Spiri@@ t on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not sh@@ out , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won '@@ t break a bru@@ ised Re@@ ed . he won '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch a di@@ mly burning w@@ ick . he will fa@@ ith@@ fully bring justice .
thus says God Yah@@ we@@ h , he who created the heav@@ ens and stret@@ ched them out , he who spread out the ear@@ th and that which comes out of it , he who gives bre@@ ath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it .
" I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have called you in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar inhabi@@ ts . let the inhabitants of Sel@@ a sing . let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains !
Yah@@ we@@ h will go out like a m@@ igh@@ ty man . he will stir up z@@ e@@ al like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will sh@@ out al@@ oud . he will triumph over his enem@@ ies .
I will destroy mountains and hil@@ ls , and d@@ ry up all their her@@ bs . I will make the rivers islands , and will d@@ ry up the po@@ ols .
" those who trust in en@@ gra@@ ved images , who tell m@@ ol@@ ten images , ' You are our go@@ ds ' will be turned back . they will be ut@@ ter@@ ly disappointed .
who is b@@ lin@@ d , but my ser@@ vant ? or who is as de@@ af as my mes@@ sen@@ ger whom I send ? who is as b@@ lin@@ d as he who is at peace , and as b@@ lin@@ d as Yah@@ we@@ h 's ser@@ vant ?
who is there among you who will give e@@ ar to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
therefore he p@@ oured the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger on him , and the strength of battle ; and it set him on fire all around , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; and it burned him , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take it to heart . "
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and fla@@ me will not scor@@ ch you .
since you have been pre@@ ci@@ ous and hon@@ ored in my sight , and I have lov@@ ed you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
I will tell the north , ' Gi@@ ve them up ! ' and tell the south , ' D@@ on '@@ t hold them back ! bring my sons from far , and my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters from the ends of the earth@@ --
I have declared , I have sav@@ ed , and I have shown ; and there was no st@@ range go@@ d among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " and I am God .
yes , since the day was I am he ; and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand . I will work , and who can hin@@ der it ? "
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel : " for your sake , I have sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring all of them down as fugitives , even the Chal@@ de@@ ans , in the ships of their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
be@@ hold , I will do a new thing . it spr@@ ings forth now . D@@ on '@@ t you know it ? I will even make a way in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert .
the animals of the field shall hon@@ or me , the j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s and the os@@ tri@@ ches ; because I give water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and rivers in the de@@ sert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your she@@ ep for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings ; neither have you hon@@ ored me with your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . I have not burdened you with offer@@ ings , nor we@@ ar@@ ied you with fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
you have bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , nor have you filled me with the f@@ at of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; but you have burdened me with your sin@@ s . you have we@@ ar@@ ied me with your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he who blo@@ ts out your trans@@ gres@@ sions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sin@@ s .
for I will p@@ our water on him who is thir@@ st@@ y , and stre@@ ams on the d@@ ry ground . I will p@@ our my Spiri@@ t on your se@@ ed , and my b@@ les@@ sing on your off@@ spring :
one will say , ' I am Yah@@ we@@ h 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jac@@ o@@ b ; and another will write with his hand ' to Yah@@ we@@ h , ' and hon@@ or the name of Israel . "
this is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the King of Israel , and his Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
be@@ hold , all his fel@@ lows will be disappointed ; and the work@@ men are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to sh@@ ame together .
the black@@ s@@ mit@@ h takes an ax@@ e , works in the co@@ als , fas@@ hi@@ ons it with ham@@ mers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hun@@ gry , and his strength fails ; he drin@@ ks no water , and is fa@@ int .
the car@@ pen@@ ter stret@@ ches out a line . he marks it out with a pen@@ cil . he shap@@ es it with planes . he marks it out with comp@@ ass@@ es , and shap@@ es it like the figure of a man , with the beauty of a man , to resi@@ de in a house .
he cuts down c@@ ed@@ ars for himself , and takes the Cy@@ press and the o@@ ak , and strength@@ ens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a f@@ ir tree , and the rain no@@ ur@@ is@@ hes it .
the rest of it he makes into a go@@ d , even his en@@ gra@@ ved image . he bo@@ ws down to it and wor@@ ships , and pr@@ ays to it , and says , " D@@ eli@@ ver me ; for you are my go@@ d ! "
they don '@@ t know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can '@@ t see ; and their hear@@ ts , that they can '@@ t understand .
he fe@@ eds on ashes . a dec@@ e@@ ived heart has turned him aside ; and he can '@@ t deliver his sou@@ l , nor say , " Is@@ n '@@ t there a lie in my right hand ? "
I have blo@@ t@@ ted out , as a th@@ ick cl@@ oud , your trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cl@@ oud , your sin@@ s . return to me , for I have re@@ deemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the roug@@ h places smooth . I will break the doors of br@@ ass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yah@@ we@@ h , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have sur@@ named you , though you have not known me .
I am Yah@@ we@@ h , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yah@@ we@@ h , and there is no one else .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , and his Mak@@ er : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the ear@@ th , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens ; and I have comman@@ ded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , con@@ founded , all of them . those who are makers of id@@ ols will go into conf@@ usion together .
" assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their en@@ gra@@ ved image , and pra@@ y to a go@@ d that can '@@ t save .

I was angry with my people , I prof@@ an@@ ed my inher@@ it@@ ance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mer@@ cy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yok@@ e .
you said , ' I shall be a mist@@ ress fore@@ ver ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
for you have tr@@ usted in your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; you have said , No one sees me ; your wis@@ dom and your knowledge , it has per@@ ver@@ ted you , and you have said in your heart , I am , and there is none else besides me .
" stand now with your en@@ chan@@ tments , and with the multi@@ tude of your sor@@ cer@@ ies , in which you have la@@ bo@@ red from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prev@@ ail .

" hear this , house of Jac@@ o@@ b , you who are called by the name of Israel , and have come forth out of the waters of Ju@@ da@@ h ; who swe@@ ar by the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I showed them : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I did them , and they happened .
therefore I have declared it to you from of old ; before it came to pass I showed it to you ; lest you should say , ' My i@@ dol has done them , and my en@@ gra@@ ved image , and my m@@ ol@@ ten image , has comman@@ ded them . '
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .

for my name 's sake will I def@@ er my an@@ ger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .

thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who teach@@ es you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t thir@@ st when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .

" for , as for your waste and your de@@ so@@ late places , and your land that has been destroyed , su@@ rely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who sw@@ allowed you up shall be far away .

for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of d@@ ry ground . he has no good looks or maj@@ es@@ ty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was desp@@ ised , and rejected by men ; a man of suffering , and acqu@@ ain@@ ted with disease . he was desp@@ ised as one from whom men hide their face ; and we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect him .

yes , the do@@ gs are gre@@ edy , they can never have enough ; and these are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
you were we@@ ar@@ ied with the length of your way ; yet you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t say , ' It is in v@@ ain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you w@@ eren '@@ t fa@@ int .

their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
the way of peace they don '@@ t know ; and there is no justice in their go@@ ings : they have made them cro@@ oked p@@ aths ; who@@ ever goes there@@ in does not know peace .

for as the ear@@ th brings forth its bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den causes the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and her sal@@ vation as a lam@@ p that bur@@ ns .

go through , go through the gates ! prepare the way of the people ! cast up , cast up the highway ! gather out the stones ! lift up a ban@@ ner for the peoples .

I will make mention of the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses of Yah@@ we@@ h and the pra@@ ises of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h has bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he has bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses .
in all their aff@@ li@@ ction he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , and the an@@ gel of his presence sav@@ ed them : in his love and in his p@@ ity he re@@ deemed them ; and he b@@ ore them , and carried them all the days of old .
but they rebel@@ led , and gri@@ ev@@ ed his hol@@ y Spiri@@ t : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that go down into the val@@ ley , the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yo@@ ur@@ self a g@@ lor@@ ious name .
look down from heav@@ en , and see from the habi@@ tation of your hol@@ iness and of your gl@@ ory : where are your z@@ e@@ al and your m@@ igh@@ ty acts ? the ye@@ ar@@ ning of your heart and your comp@@ as@@ sion is re@@ strained toward me .
when you did aw@@ es@@ ome things which we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t look for , you came down , the mountains qu@@ aked at your presence .
you meet him who re@@ jo@@ ices and works righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those who remember you in your ways . be@@ hold , you were angry , and we sin@@ ned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be sav@@ ed ?
for we have all become as one who is un@@ clean , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is as a pollu@@ ted gar@@ ment : and we all fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , take us away .
there is none who calls on your name , who s@@ tir@@ s up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consu@@ med us by means of our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
but now , Yah@@ we@@ h , you are our F@@ ather ; we are the cla@@ y , and you our P@@ ot@@ ter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
" I am inqu@@ ired of by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , Se@@ e me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebel@@ li@@ ous people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own th@@ ou@@ ghts ;
who sit among the graves , and lo@@ dge in the secret places ; who eat pi@@ g 's f@@ les@@ h , and bro@@ th of ab@@ omin@@ able things is in their vessels ;
I will bring forth a se@@ ed out of Jac@@ o@@ b , and out of Ju@@ da@@ h an inher@@ it@@ or of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inher@@ it it , and my servants shall d@@ well there .
Shar@@ on shall be a fold of f@@ loc@@ ks , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or a place for her@@ ds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
but be you glad and re@@ jo@@ ice fore@@ ver in that which I create ; for , be@@ hold , I create Jer@@ usalem a re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , and her people a joy .
I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of we@@ eping and the voice of cr@@ ying .
they shall not build , and another in@@ ha@@ bit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " He@@ av@@ en is my th@@ r@@ one , and the ear@@ th is my foot@@ st@@ ool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Yah@@ we@@ h : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contr@@ ite spirit , and who tre@@ m@@ bles at my word .
I also will choose their de@@ lu@@ sions , and will bring their fears on them ; because when I called , no one answ@@ ered ; when I spoke , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ; but they did that which was ev@@ il in my eyes , and chose that in which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ light . "
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the gl@@ ory of the nations like an over@@ flow@@ ing stream : and you will nur@@ se . you will be carried on her side , and will be d@@ and@@ led on her k@@ ne@@ es .

for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h will come with fire , and his char@@ i@@ ots shall be like the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind ; to ren@@ der his an@@ ger with fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess , and his re@@ bu@@ ke with fla@@ mes of fire .
for by fire will Yah@@ we@@ h exec@@ ute judgment , and by his s@@ word , on all f@@ les@@ h ; and the sla@@ in of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be many .
" for as the new heav@@ ens and the new ear@@ th , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " so your se@@ ed and your name shall remain .
" they shall go forth , and look on the dead bodies of the men who have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their wor@@ m shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they will be lo@@ ath@@ some to all man@@ kind . "
the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , of the pri@@ ests who were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the thir@@ teen@@ th year of his reign .
" before I formed you in the bel@@ ly , I knew you . before you came forth out of the w@@ om@@ b , I sanc@@ ti@@ fied you . I have appointed you a pro@@ phe@@ t to the nations . "
but Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " D@@ on '@@ t say , ' I am a child ; ' for to who@@ ever I shall send you , you shall go , and whatever I shall command you , you shall speak .
then Yah@@ we@@ h put forth his hand , and touched my m@@ outh ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " be@@ hold , I have put my words in your m@@ outh .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a bo@@ iling cal@@ dr@@ on ; and it is ti@@ pping away from the north . "
for , be@@ hold , I will call all the families of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the north , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his th@@ r@@ one at the entrance of the gates of Jer@@ usalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ ped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . D@@ on '@@ t be dis@@ may@@ ed at them , lest I dis@@ may you before them .
" go , and cry in the e@@ ars of Jer@@ usalem , saying , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I remember for you the kin@@ d@@ ness of your youth , the love of your w@@ ed@@ dings ; how you went after me in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a land that was not so@@ wn .

" for my people have committed two ev@@ ils : they have for@@ sak@@ en me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out c@@ ister@@ ns , broken c@@ ister@@ ns , that can hold no water .
" ha@@ ven '@@ t you proc@@ ured this to yo@@ ur@@ self , in that you have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h your God , when he led you by the way ?
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shi@@ h@@ or ? or what have you to do in the way to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , to drink the waters of the River ?
" for of old time I have broken your yok@@ e , and bur@@ st your bonds ; and you said , ' I will not serve ; ' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bo@@ wed yo@@ ur@@ self , playing the pro@@ stitute .
" with@@ hold your fo@@ ot from being un@@ sho@@ d , and your thro@@ at from thir@@ st . but you said , ' It is in v@@ ain . no , for I have lov@@ ed st@@ ran@@ gers , and I will go after them . '
as the th@@ i@@ ef is as@@ ha@@ med when he is found , so is the house of Israel as@@ ha@@ med ; they , their kings , their pr@@ inces , and their pri@@ ests , and their pro@@ ph@@ ets ;
" but where are your go@@ ds that you have made for yo@@ ur@@ selves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h .
" I have struck your children in v@@ ain . they received no correc@@ tion . your own s@@ word has dev@@ oured your pro@@ ph@@ ets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the innocent poor is found in your sk@@ ir@@ ts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . su@@ rely his an@@ ger has turned away from me . ' " be@@ hold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sin@@ ned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be as@@ ha@@ med of Egypt also , as you were as@@ ha@@ med of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosp@@ er with them .
I said after she had done all these things , ' S@@ he will return to me ; ' but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return ; and her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h saw it .
I saw , when , for this very cause that back@@ sli@@ ding Israel had committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , I had put her away and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , yet t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous Ju@@ da@@ h , her sister , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear ; but she also went and played the pro@@ stitute .
it happened through the ligh@@ t@@ ness of her prostitution , that the land was pollu@@ ted , and she committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with stones and with sto@@ cks .
only acknowledge your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that you have trans@@ g@@ ressed against Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and have sc@@ at@@ tered your ways to the st@@ ran@@ gers under every green tree , and you have not obe@@ yed my voice , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h . "
" return , back@@ sli@@ ding children , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Z@@ ion .
at that time they shall call Jer@@ usalem ' The th@@ r@@ one of Yah@@ we@@ h ; ' and all the nations shall be gathered to it , to the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , to Jer@@ usalem . neither shall they walk any more after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of their ev@@ il heart .

a lion is gone up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land de@@ so@@ late , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabi@@ tant .
" it shall happen at that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " that the heart of the king shall per@@ ish , and the heart of the pr@@ inces ; and the pri@@ ests shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall wonder . "

" for my people are fo@@ ol@@ ish , they don '@@ t know me . they are fo@@ ol@@ ish children , and they have no understanding . they are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in doing ev@@ il , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw the mountains , and be@@ hold , they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and all the hil@@ ls moved back and forth .
for this the ear@@ th will mour@@ n , and the heav@@ ens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have pur@@ posed it , and I have not re@@ pen@@ ted , neither will I turn back from it . "
every city fle@@ es for the no@@ ise of the hor@@ se@@ men and ar@@ chers ; they go into the th@@ ic@@ kets , and clim@@ b up on the ro@@ cks : every city is for@@ sak@@ en , and not a man d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in .
I will go to the great men , and will speak to them ; for they know the way of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the law of their God . " but these with one accord have broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
" how can I par@@ don you ? your children have for@@ sak@@ en me , and sworn by what are no go@@ ds . when I had f@@ ed them to the full , they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and assemb@@ led themselves in troops at the pro@@ stitu@@ tes ' houses .
the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
be@@ hold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Yah@@ we@@ h . " it is a m@@ igh@@ ty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don '@@ t know , neither understand what they say .
they shall eat up your har@@ v@@ est , and your bread , which your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat . they shall eat up your f@@ loc@@ ks and your her@@ ds . they shall eat up your v@@ ines and your fi@@ g trees . they shall beat down your for@@ ti@@ fied cities , in which you trust , with the s@@ word .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Yah@@ we@@ h our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preser@@ ves to us the appointed weeks of the har@@ v@@ est . '
they have grown f@@ at . they sh@@ ine ; yes , they exc@@ ell in de@@ eds of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . they don '@@ t p@@ lead the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , that they may prosp@@ er ; and they don '@@ t judge the right of the ne@@ edy .
she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds with their f@@ loc@@ ks shall come to her ; they shall pit@@ ch their ten@@ ts against her all around ; they shall fe@@ ed everyone in his place . "
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can '@@ t listen . be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has become a re@@ pro@@ ach to them . they have no de@@ light in it .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wi@@ ves together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yah@@ we@@ h . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and from the pro@@ phe@@ t even to the pri@@ est , everyone deals fal@@ sely .
they have he@@ aled also the hurt of my people super@@ fic@@ ially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
hear , ear@@ th ! be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this people , even the fruit of their th@@ ou@@ ghts , because they have not list@@ ened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se from She@@ ba , and the swe@@ et can@@ e from a far country ? your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings are not acceptable , nor your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ple@@ asing to me . "
they take hold of bo@@ w and spe@@ ar . they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy . their voice ro@@ ars like the sea , and they ride on hor@@ ses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Z@@ ion . "
D@@ on '@@ t go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the s@@ word of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
the bel@@ lows blow fierc@@ ely ; the lead is consu@@ med of the fire : in v@@ ain do they go on refin@@ ing ; for the w@@ ic@@ ked are not p@@ lu@@ cked away .
for if you thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly amend your ways and your do@@ ings ; if you thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly exec@@ ute justice between a man and his neigh@@ bor ;
if you don '@@ t op@@ press the foreig@@ ner , the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , and don '@@ t shed innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other go@@ ds to your own hurt :
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , from of old even fore@@ ver@@ more .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of rob@@ bers in your eyes ? be@@ hold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but go now to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I caused my name to d@@ well at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer :
therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name , in which you trust , and to the place which I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , as I did to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
the children gather wood , and the fa@@ thers kin@@ dle the fire , and the women k@@ ne@@ ad the d@@ ough , to make cak@@ es to the qu@@ een of the sky , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds , that they may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
for I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak to your fa@@ thers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
but this thing I comman@@ ded them , saying , listen to my voice , and I will be your God , and you shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
for the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , says Yah@@ we@@ h : they have set their ab@@ omin@@ ations in the house which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
they have built the high places of Top@@ het@@ h , which is in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , to bur@@ n their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the fire ; which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be called Top@@ het@@ h , nor The val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but The val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter : for they shall bur@@ y in Top@@ het@@ h , until there is no place to bur@@ y .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the ear@@ th ; and none shall fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de ; for the land shall become a waste .
at that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves ;
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due that remain of this ev@@ il family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
I list@@ ened and heard , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ts him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a hor@@ se that rus@@ hes head@@ long in the battle .
yes , the stor@@ k in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve and the sw@@ allow and the cr@@ ane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : be@@ hold , they have rejected the word of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and what kind of wis@@ dom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wi@@ ves to others , and their fields to those who shall poss@@ ess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; from the pro@@ phe@@ t even to the pri@@ est every one deals fal@@ sely .
they have he@@ aled the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they as@@ ha@@ med when they had committed ab@@ omin@@ ation ? n@@ ay , they were not at all as@@ ha@@ med , neither could they b@@ lus@@ h : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mour@@ n ; dis@@ may has taken hold on me .
O@@ h that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of te@@ ars , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sla@@ in of the daughter of my people !
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
they b@@ end their ton@@ gue , as their bo@@ w , for fal@@ se@@ hood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from ev@@ il to ev@@ il , and they don '@@ t know me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
they will dec@@ e@@ ive everyone his neigh@@ bor , and will not speak the truth : they have ta@@ ught their ton@@ gue to speak lies ; they we@@ ary themselves to commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
their ton@@ gue is a deadly ar@@ row ; it speaks dec@@ e@@ it : one speaks peac@@ e@@ ably to his neigh@@ bor with his m@@ outh , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
who is the wise man , that may understand this ? who is he to whom the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken , that he may declare it ? why is the land per@@ ished and burned up like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , so that none passes through ?
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known ; and I will send the s@@ word after them , until I have consu@@ med them .
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our pal@@ aces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , D@@ on '@@ t let the wise man gl@@ ory in his wis@@ dom , neither let the m@@ igh@@ ty man gl@@ ory in his might , don '@@ t let the rich man gl@@ ory in his ri@@ ches ;
for the customs of the peoples are van@@ ity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man with the ax@@ e .
they are like a pal@@ m tree , of turned work , and don '@@ t speak : they must be carried , because they can '@@ t go . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of them ; for they can '@@ t do ev@@ il , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it ap@@ per@@ tains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the arti@@ fic@@ er and of the hands of the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h ; blue and pur@@ ple for their clo@@ thing ; they are all the work of s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful men .
but Yah@@ we@@ h is the true God ; he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting King : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles , and the nations are not able to with@@ stand his in@@ dign@@ ation .
he has made the ear@@ th by his power , he has established the world by his wis@@ dom , and by his understanding has he stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens :
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ nings for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
every man has become bru@@ tish and without knowledge ; every gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h is disappointed by his en@@ gra@@ ved image ; for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tri@@ be of his inher@@ it@@ ance : Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds are become bru@@ tish , and have not inqu@@ ired of Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore they have not prosp@@ ered , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks are sc@@ at@@ tered .
the voice of news , be@@ hold , it comes , and a great commo@@ tion out of the north country , to make the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ wel@@ ling place of j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s .
p@@ our out your wr@@ ath on the nations that don '@@ t know you , and on the families that don '@@ t call on your name : for they have dev@@ oured Jac@@ o@@ b , yes , they have dev@@ oured him and consu@@ med him , and have laid waste his habi@@ tation .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
then shall the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem go and cry to the go@@ ds to which they offer incen@@ se : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have you set up al@@ tar@@ s to the sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
Yah@@ we@@ h called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he has kin@@ d@@ led fire on it , and its branches are broken .
for Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who plan@@ ted you , has pronounced ev@@ il against you , because of the ev@@ il of the house of Israel and of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , which they have worked for themselves in prov@@ oking me to an@@ ger by offering incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
but , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who judges righ@@ te@@ ously , who tests the heart and the mind , I shall see your ven@@ ge@@ ance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the s@@ word ; their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall die by fam@@ ine ;
and there shall be no re@@ mn@@ ant to them : for I will bring ev@@ il on the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
you have plan@@ ted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their m@@ outh , and far from their heart .
but you , Yah@@ we@@ h , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter , and prepare them for the day of sla@@ ughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with you ; even they have cri@@ ed al@@ oud after you : D@@ on '@@ t believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have for@@ sak@@ en my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed of my sou@@ l into the hand of her enem@@ ies .
they have made it a de@@ so@@ lation ; it mour@@ ns to me , being de@@ so@@ late ; the whole land is made de@@ so@@ late , because no man lays it to heart .
D@@ est@@ ro@@ yers have come on all the b@@ are he@@ ights in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; for the s@@ word of Yah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h has peace .
they have so@@ wn wheat , and have re@@ ap@@ ed thor@@ ns ; they have put themselves to p@@ ain , and profit nothing : and you shall be as@@ ha@@ med of your fru@@ its , because of the fierce an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h against all my ev@@ il neigh@@ b@@ ors , who touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it : be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them up from off their land , and will p@@ lu@@ ck up the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
it shall happen , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them up , I will return and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the bel@@ t that you have bought , which is on your wa@@ ist , and arise , go to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and hide it there in a cle@@ ft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , arise , go to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and take the bel@@ t from there , which I comman@@ ded you to hide there .
then I went to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and du@@ g , and took the bel@@ t from the place where I had hidden it ; and be@@ hold , the bel@@ t was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
this ev@@ il people , who refuse to hear my words , who walk in the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of their heart , and are gone after other go@@ ds to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this bel@@ t , which is profitable for nothing .
I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fa@@ thers and the sons together , says Yah@@ we@@ h : I will not p@@ ity , nor spar@@ e , nor have comp@@ as@@ sion , that I should not destroy them .
give gl@@ ory to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , before he causes d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble on the dark mountains , and , while you look for light , he turns it into the shadow of death , and makes it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
but if you will not hear it , my sou@@ l shall we@@ ep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall we@@ ep bit@@ ter@@ ly , and run down with te@@ ars , because Yah@@ we@@ h 's flock is taken cap@@ tive .
say to the king and to the qu@@ een mother , hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , sit down ; for your he@@ addresses have come down , even the cro@@ wn of your gl@@ ory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Ju@@ da@@ h is carried away cap@@ tive , all of it ; it is wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yo@@ ur@@ self ta@@ ught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
if you say in your heart , Wh@@ y are these things come on me ? for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity are your sk@@ ir@@ ts uncovered , and your he@@ els suffer violence .
their no@@ bles send their little ones to the waters : they come to the c@@ ister@@ ns , and find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are disappointed and con@@ founded , and cover their heads .
because of the ground which is cr@@ acked , because no rain has been in the land , the p@@ low@@ men are disappointed , they cover their heads .
you hope of Israel , its Sav@@ ior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreig@@ ner in the land , and as a w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
why should you be like a scar@@ ed man , as a m@@ igh@@ ty man who can '@@ t save ? yet you , Yah@@ we@@ h , are in the mid@@ st of us , and we are called by your name ; don '@@ t leave us .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer bur@@ n@@ t offering and me@@ al offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consum@@ e them by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them@@ -@@ -@@ them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess on them .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with te@@ ars night and day , and let them not ce@@ ase ; for the vir@@ gin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous wo@@ und .
have you ut@@ ter@@ ly rejected Ju@@ da@@ h ? has your sou@@ l lo@@ ath@@ ed Z@@ ion ? why have you struck us , and there is no he@@ aling for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of he@@ aling , and be@@ hold , dis@@ may !
then Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , Th@@ ough Mos@@ es and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind would not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
I will cause them to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
I have win@@ no@@ wed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused an@@ gu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
Yah@@ we@@ h said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the time of ev@@ il and in the time of aff@@ li@@ ction .
your sub@@ stance and your treasures will I give for a sp@@ oil without price , and that for all your sin@@ s , even in all your borders .
your words were found , and I ate them ; and your words were to me a joy and the re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing of my heart : for I am called by your name , Yah@@ we@@ h , God of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sit in the assembly of those who make mer@@ ry , nor re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with in@@ dign@@ ation .
I will make you to this people a for@@ ti@@ fied bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prev@@ ail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will deliver you out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and I will re@@ de@@ em you out of the hand of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who b@@ ore them , and concerning their fa@@ thers who became their father in this land :
neither shall men break bread for them in mourning , to comfor@@ t them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the c@@ up of con@@ so@@ lation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de .
it shall happen , when you shall show this people all these words , and they shall tell you , Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h pronounced all this great ev@@ il against us ? or what is our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yah@@ we@@ h our God ?
then you shall tell them , Bec@@ ause your fa@@ thers have for@@ sak@@ en me , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and have walked after other go@@ ds , and have served them , and have wor@@ shi@@ ped them , and have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have not kept my law ;
and you have done ev@@ il more than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , you walk every one after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his ev@@ il heart , so that you don '@@ t listen to me :
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fa@@ thers ; and there you shall serve other go@@ ds day and night ; for I will show you no fav@@ or .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be said , As Yah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity conce@@ aled from my eyes .
first I will re@@ compen@@ se their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double , because they have pollu@@ ted my land with the car@@ c@@ ass@@ es of their de@@ te@@ stable things , and have filled my inher@@ it@@ ance with their ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore be@@ hold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yah@@ we@@ h .
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is en@@ gra@@ ved on the tab@@ let of their heart , and on the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
my mountain in the field , I will give your sub@@ stance and all your treasures for a sp@@ oil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
you , even of yo@@ ur@@ self , shall dis@@ continue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enem@@ ies in the land which you don '@@ t know : for you have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in my an@@ ger which shall bur@@ n fore@@ ver .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a salt land and not inhabited .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge that s@@ its on eg@@ gs which she has not laid , so is he who gets ri@@ ches , and not by right ; in the mid@@ st of his days they shall leave him , and at his end he shall be a fo@@ ol .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the hope of Israel , all who for@@ sake you shall be disappointed . those who de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , the spring of living waters .
let them be disappointed who persec@@ ute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dis@@ may@@ ed , but don '@@ t let me be dis@@ may@@ ed ; bring on them the day of ev@@ il , and destroy them with double destruction .
thus said Yah@@ we@@ h to me : go , and stand in the gate of the children of the people , through which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
and tell them , He@@ ar the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , you kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and all Ju@@ da@@ h , and all the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , that enter in by these gates :
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day hol@@ y , neither do any work : but make the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , as I comman@@ ded your fa@@ thers .
it shall happen , if you dil@@ ig@@ ently listen to me , says Yah@@ we@@ h , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , but to make the Sab@@ b@@ ath day hol@@ y , to do no work there@@ in ;
they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places around Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the low@@ land , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and me@@ al offer@@ ings , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then I went down to the P@@ ot@@ ter 's house , and be@@ hold , he was making a work on the whe@@ els .
when the ves@@ sel that he made of the cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter , he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
at what in@@ stan@@ t I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a k@@ ing@@ dom , to p@@ lu@@ ck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is ev@@ il in my sight , that they not obe@@ y my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incen@@ se to false go@@ ds ; and they have been made to st@@ um@@ ble in their ways , in the ancient p@@ aths , to walk in by@@ ways , in a way not built up ;
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and give them over to the power of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves become ch@@ ild@@ less , and wi@@ dows ; and let their men be sla@@ in of death , and their young men struck of the s@@ word in battle .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them ; for they have du@@ g a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
and go forth to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the gate Har@@ s@@ ith , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell you ;
and have built the high places of Ba@@ al , to bur@@ n their sons in the fire for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Ba@@ al ; which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that this place shall no more be called Top@@ het@@ h , nor The val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but The val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter .
I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the ear@@ th .
I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and they shall eat everyone the f@@ les@@ h of his friend , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress , with which their enem@@ ies , and those who seek their life , shall dist@@ ress them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which are def@@ iled , shall be as the place of Top@@ het@@ h , even all the houses on whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se to all the army of the sky , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds .
then came Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Top@@ het@@ h , where Yah@@ we@@ h had sent him to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ; and he stood in the court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and said to all the people :
now P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Im@@ mer the pri@@ est , who was chief officer in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , heard Jerem@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying these things .
then P@@ ash@@ hur struck Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the up@@ per gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
moreover I will give all the ri@@ ches of this city , and all its gains , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall make them a pre@@ y , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
for as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Viol@@ ence and destruction ! because the word of Yah@@ we@@ h is made a re@@ pro@@ ach to me , and a der@@ ision , all the day .
but , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who tests the righ@@ te@@ ous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your ven@@ ge@@ ance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
Cur@@ sed is the day in which I was born : D@@ on '@@ t let the day in which my mother b@@ ore me be b@@ les@@ sed .
let that man be as the cities which Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and sh@@ ou@@ ting at no@@ on@@ time ;
because he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill me from the w@@ om@@ b ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her w@@ om@@ b always great .
I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stret@@ ched hand and with a strong arm , even in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation .
he who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chal@@ de@@ ans who bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y .
for I have set my face on this city for ev@@ il , and not for good , says Yah@@ we@@ h : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire .
be@@ hold , I am against you , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and of the rock of the pla@@ in , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; you that say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; and I will kin@@ dle a fire in her forest , and it shall dev@@ our all that is around her .
say , He@@ ar the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
I will prepare destro@@ yers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice c@@ ed@@ ars , and cast them into the fire .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h tou@@ ching S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who re@@ ig@@ ned instead of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
Wo@@ e to him who buil@@ ds his house by un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and his rooms by in@@ justice ; who uses his neigh@@ bor 's service without wages , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t give him his h@@ ire ;
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y my voice .
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
I will cast you out , and your mother who b@@ ore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken ves@@ sel ? is he a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts ? why are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into the land which they don '@@ t know ?
I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and multi@@ ply .
I will set up she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds over them , who shall fe@@ ed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
in his days Ju@@ da@@ h shall be sav@@ ed , and Israel shall d@@ well saf@@ ely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yah@@ we@@ h our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that they shall no more say , As Yah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets . my heart within me is broken , all my b@@ ones shake ; I am like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because of his hol@@ y words .
for the land is full of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of swe@@ aring the land mour@@ ns ; the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness are dri@@ ed up . their course is ev@@ il , and their might is not right ;
therefore their way shall be to them as sli@@ p@@ per@@ y places in the d@@ ark@@ ness : they shall be driven on , and fall there@@ in ; for I will bring ev@@ il on them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
they say continu@@ ally to those who desp@@ ise me , Yah@@ we@@ h has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walk@@ s in the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his own heart they say , No ev@@ il shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he should perce@@ ive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
be@@ hold , the storm of Yah@@ we@@ h , his wr@@ ath , has gone forth . yes , a wh@@ ir@@ ling storm . it shall bur@@ st on the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
how long shall this be in the heart of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y lies , even the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the dec@@ e@@ it of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dre@@ ams which they tell every man to his neigh@@ bor , as their fa@@ thers for@@ got my name for Ba@@ al .
the pro@@ phe@@ t who has a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he who has my word , let him speak my word fa@@ ith@@ fully . what is the stra@@ w to the wheat ? says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but if you say , The burden of Yah@@ we@@ h ; therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : because you say this word , The burden of Yah@@ we@@ h , and I have sent to you , saying , You shall not say , The burden of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , away from my presence :
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , like the fig@@ s that are first @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ pe ; and the other bas@@ ket had very bad fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : like these good fig@@ s , so will I regard the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for good .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will even give them up to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th for ev@@ il ; to be a re@@ pro@@ ach and a pro@@ ver@@ b , a ta@@ un@@ t and a cur@@ se , in all places where I shall drive them .
I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , until they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h ( the same was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) ,
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to this day , these twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not list@@ ened .
Yah@@ we@@ h has sent to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not list@@ ened , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear )
saying , Ret@@ ur@@ n now everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and d@@ well in the land that Yah@@ we@@ h has given to you and to your fa@@ thers , from of old and even fore@@ ver@@ more ;
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the lam@@ p .
it shall happen , when sev@@ enty years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and that nation , says Yah@@ we@@ h , for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and I will make it de@@ so@@ late fore@@ ver .
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah has pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall make bon@@ d@@ servants of them , even of them ; and I will re@@ compen@@ se them according to their de@@ eds , and according to the work of their hands .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to me : take this c@@ up of the wine of wr@@ ath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be ma@@ d , because of the s@@ word that I will send among them .
then took I the c@@ up at Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yah@@ we@@ h had sent me :
Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and its kings , and its pr@@ inces , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , a his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se , as it is this day ;
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Gaza , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of T@@ y@@ re , and all the kings of S@@ id@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ le which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who d@@ well in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ;
and all the kings of Z@@ im@@ ri , and all the kings of E@@ lam , and all the kings of the Me@@ des ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the c@@ up at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : you shall su@@ rely drink .
a no@@ ise shall come even to the end of the ear@@ th ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all f@@ les@@ h : as for the w@@ ic@@ ked , he will give them to the s@@ word , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the sla@@ in of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung on the sur@@ face of the ground .
W@@ ail , you she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and cry ; and w@@ allow in d@@ ust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your sla@@ ughter and of your disper@@ sions are fully come , and you shall fall like a good@@ ly ves@@ sel .
the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and the w@@ ailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yah@@ we@@ h lays waste their pas@@ ture .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : stand in the court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and speak to all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , which come to worship in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , all the words that I command you to speak to them ; don '@@ t dimin@@ ish a word .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h : if you will not listen to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to listen to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not list@@ ened ;
it happened , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him to speak to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall su@@ rely die .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
then rose up certain of the el@@ ders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , U@@ ri@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ; and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah :
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when U@@ ri@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king sent men into Egypt , El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , who killed him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , and to the king of T@@ y@@ re , and to the king of S@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers who come to Jer@@ usalem to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
I have made the ear@@ th , the men and the animals that are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant .
but as for you , don '@@ t you listen to your pro@@ ph@@ ets , nor to your di@@ vin@@ ers , nor to your dre@@ ams , nor to your so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , nor to your sor@@ cer@@ ers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should per@@ ish .
why will you die , you and your people , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ?
D@@ on '@@ t listen to the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie to you .
yes , thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and at Jer@@ usalem :
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ z@@ ur , the pro@@ phe@@ t , who was of Gi@@ be@@ on , spoke to me in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , with all the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , who went to Bab@@ yl@@ on , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; for I will break the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to the pro@@ phe@@ t Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah in the presence of the pri@@ ests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your e@@ ars , and in the e@@ ars of all the people :
the pro@@ phe@@ t who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies of peace , when the word of the pro@@ phe@@ t shall happen , then shall the pro@@ phe@@ t be known , that Yah@@ we@@ h has truly sent him .
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the bar from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , to all the cap@@ tivity , whom I have caused to be carried away cap@@ tive from Jer@@ usalem to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
take wi@@ ves , and father sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and take wi@@ ves for your sons , and give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to hus@@ bands , that they may bear sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and multi@@ ply there , and don '@@ t be dimin@@ ished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : D@@ on '@@ t let your pro@@ ph@@ ets who are in the mid@@ st of you , and your di@@ vin@@ ers , dec@@ e@@ ive you ; neither listen to your dre@@ ams which you cause to be dre@@ amed .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , After sev@@ enty years are accomplished for Bab@@ yl@@ on , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , and concerning all the people who d@@ well in this city , your brothers who ha@@ ven '@@ t gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ; be@@ hold , I will send on them the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and will make them like v@@ ile fig@@ s , that can '@@ t be e@@ aten , they are so bad .
because they have not list@@ ened to my words , says Yah@@ we@@ h , with which I sent to them my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h has made you pri@@ est in the place of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that there may be officers in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , for every man who is ma@@ d , and makes himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that you should put him in the sto@@ cks and in sh@@ ack@@ les .
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the Ne@@ he@@ lam@@ ite : because Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah has pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to you , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
ask now , and see whether a man does trav@@ ail with child : why do I see every man with his hands on his wa@@ ist , as a woman in trav@@ ail , and all faces are turned into pal@@ eness ?
it shall come to pass in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , that I will break his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and will bur@@ st your bonds ; and st@@ ran@@ gers shall no more make him their bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ;
all your lov@@ ers have forgotten you ; they don '@@ t seek you : for I have wounded you with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because your sin@@ s were increased .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your p@@ ain is inc@@ ur@@ able : for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because your sin@@ s were increased , I have done these things to you .
therefore all those who dev@@ our you shall be dev@@ oured ; and all your ad@@ vers@@ aries , everyone of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and those who desp@@ oil you shall be a sp@@ oil , and all who pre@@ y on you will I give for a pre@@ y .
for I will restore health to you , and I will he@@ al you of your wounds , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; because they have called you an out@@ cast , saying , It is Z@@ ion , whom no man seeks after .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will turn again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on his d@@ wel@@ ling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of those who make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
their pr@@ ince shall be of themselves , and their ru@@ ler shall proceed from their mid@@ st ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had bol@@ d@@ ness to approach to me ? says Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , the storm of Yah@@ we@@ h , his wr@@ ath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall bur@@ st on the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the fierce an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the inten@@ tions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
again will I build you , and you shall be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : again you shall be ad@@ or@@ ned with your tam@@ bour@@ ines , and shall go forth in the dan@@ ces of those who make mer@@ ry .
again you shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards on the mountains of Samar@@ ia ; the plan@@ ters shall plant , and shall enjoy its fruit .
for there shall be a day , that the watch@@ men on the hil@@ ls of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall cry , arise , and let us go up to Z@@ ion to Yah@@ we@@ h our God .
they shall come with we@@ eping ; and with peti@@ tions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a stra@@ ight way in which they shall not st@@ um@@ ble ; for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
then shall the vir@@ gin re@@ jo@@ ice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfor@@ t them , and make them re@@ jo@@ ice from their sor@@ row .
I will s@@ ati@@ ate the sou@@ l of the pri@@ ests with fat@@ ness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Go@@ od@@ ness , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
I have su@@ rely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ an@@ ing himself thus , You have ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed , as an un@@ trained cal@@ f : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yah@@ we@@ h my God .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I struck on my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , yes , even con@@ founded , because I b@@ ore the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to p@@ lu@@ ck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to aff@@ lic@@ t , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
in those days they shall say no more , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : every man who e@@ ats the s@@ our grap@@ es , his te@@ eth shall be set on edge .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : if heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , then will I also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h in the tenth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , which was the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
now at that time the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army was bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ing Jer@@ usalem ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
and he shall bring Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : though you fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , you shall not prosp@@ er ?
so I took the de@@ ed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : take these de@@ eds , this de@@ ed of the purchase which is sealed , and this de@@ ed which is open , and put them in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel ; that they may continue many days .
A@@ h Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ! be@@ hold , you have made the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th by your great power and by your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness to thousands , and re@@ compen@@ se the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers into the bos@@ om of their children after them ; the great , the m@@ igh@@ ty God , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name ;
great in coun@@ sel , and m@@ igh@@ ty in work ; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men , to give everyone according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
who performed signs and won@@ ders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yo@@ ur@@ self a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror ;
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done only that which was ev@@ il in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
for this city has been to me a provoc@@ ation of my an@@ ger and of my wr@@ ath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I ta@@ ught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not list@@ ened to receive in@@ struction .
now therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my an@@ ger , and in my wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they may not de@@ part from me .
yes , I will re@@ jo@@ ice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ red@@ ly with my whole heart and with my whole sou@@ l .
moreover the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cause the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and the cap@@ tivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habi@@ tation of she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds causing their f@@ loc@@ ks to lie down .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the low@@ land , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those days shall Ju@@ da@@ h be sav@@ ed , and Jer@@ usalem shall d@@ well saf@@ ely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yah@@ we@@ h our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
as the army of the sky can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed , neither the s@@ and of the sea meas@@ ured ; so will I multi@@ ply the se@@ ed of David my ser@@ vant , and the L@@ evi@@ tes who minister to me .
D@@ on '@@ t consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yah@@ we@@ h chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they desp@@ ise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th that were under his domin@@ ion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , G@@ o , and speak to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and tell him , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire :
when the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army was fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish and against Az@@ ek@@ ah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h as for@@ ti@@ fied cities .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people who were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty to them ;
that every man should let his male ser@@ vant , and every man his female ser@@ vant , who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bon@@ d@@ servants of them , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge , saying ,
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but you turned and prof@@ an@@ ed my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom you had let go free at their pleas@@ ure , to return ; and you brought them into subj@@ ection , to be to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , who have gone away from you .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
go to the house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ az@@ z@@ in@@ i@@ ah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes ;
neither shall you build house , nor so@@ w se@@ ed , nor plant v@@ ine@@ yard , nor have any ; but all your days you shall d@@ well in ten@@ ts ; that you may live many days in the land in which you live .
we have obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , our father , in all that he comman@@ ded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , or our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
but we have lived in ten@@ ts , and have obe@@ yed , and done according to all that Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b our father comman@@ ded us .
but it happened , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans ; so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b have performed the comman@@ d@@ ment of their father which he comman@@ ded them , but this people has not list@@ ened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
take a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah ; and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the s@@ cr@@ oll , which you have written from my m@@ outh , the words of Yah@@ we@@ h in the e@@ ars of the people in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h who come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supp@@ lic@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h , and will return everyone from his ev@@ il way ; for great is the an@@ ger and the wr@@ ath that Yah@@ we@@ h has pronounced against this people .
Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah did according to all that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t comman@@ ded him , reading in the book the words of Yah@@ we@@ h in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
now it happened in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h to Jer@@ usalem , proclaimed a fast before Yah@@ we@@ h .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the room of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , the s@@ cri@@ be , in the up@@ per court , at the entry of the new gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
when Mic@@ ai@@ ah the son of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's room : and be@@ hold , all the pr@@ inces were sitting there , E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
then Mic@@ ai@@ ah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ u@@ ch read the book in the e@@ ars of the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Bar@@ u@@ ch , We will su@@ rely tell the king of all these words .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the s@@ cr@@ oll in the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be ; and they told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to get the s@@ cr@@ oll ; and he took it out of the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be . J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces who stood bes@@ ide the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the bra@@ z@@ ier burning before him .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ udi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the pen@@ k@@ ni@@ fe , and cast it into the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier , until all the s@@ cr@@ oll was consu@@ med in the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier .
they were not afraid , nor t@@ ore their gar@@ ments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover El@@ na@@ than and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah had made inter@@ c@@ ession to the king that he would not bur@@ n the s@@ cr@@ oll ; but he would not hear them .
the king comman@@ ded Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el the king 's son , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Az@@ ri@@ el , and She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of Ab@@ de@@ el , to take Bar@@ u@@ ch the s@@ cri@@ be and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t ; but Yah@@ we@@ h hi@@ d them .
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the s@@ cr@@ oll , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
take again another s@@ cr@@ oll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first s@@ cr@@ oll , which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has burned .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h : he shall have none to sit on the th@@ r@@ one of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah re@@ ig@@ ned as king , instead of Con@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made king in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , list@@ ened to the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ing Jer@@ usalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jer@@ usalem .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to me to inqu@@ ire of me : be@@ hold , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
the pr@@ inces were angry with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had come into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on house , and into the cells , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah had remained there many days ;
where now are your pro@@ ph@@ ets who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to you , saying , The king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Mat@@ tan , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , and Ju@@ cal the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and P@@ ash@@ hur the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , heard the words that Jerem@@ i@@ ah spoke to all the people , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , He who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y , and he shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah san@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed@@ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , a e@@ un@@ u@@ ch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the fam@@ ine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
so E@@ bed@@ me@@ le@@ ch took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treas@@ ury , and took there ra@@ gs and worn @@@ -@@ @ out gar@@ ments , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with the cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and the king said to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver you . obe@@ y , I be@@ g you , the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your sou@@ l shall live .
they shall bring out all your wi@@ ves and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then you shall tell them , I presented my supp@@ lic@@ ation before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jon@@ athan 's house , to die there .
then came all the pr@@ inces to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had comman@@ ded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jer@@ usalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on and all his army against Jer@@ usalem , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it ;
in the ele@@ venth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
it happened that , when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Ara@@ bah .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in R@@ ib@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed all the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h .
moreover he put out Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah 's eyes , and bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , to carry him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jer@@ usalem .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the resi@@ due of the people who remained in the city , the de@@ ser@@ ters also who fell away to him , and the resi@@ due of the people who remained .
but Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
now the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will su@@ rely save you , and you shall not fall by the s@@ word , but your life shall be for a pre@@ y to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all the cap@@ tives of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , who were carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
then they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an and Jon@@ athan the sons of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th , and the sons of Ep@@ hai the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ite , they and their men .
G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an s@@ wor@@ e to them and to their men , saying , D@@ on '@@ t be afraid to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans : d@@ well in the land , and serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and it shall be well with you .
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , to stand before the Chal@@ de@@ ans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fru@@ its and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the children of Am@@ mon , and in E@@ dom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and gathered wine and summer fru@@ its very much .
moreover Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were in the fields , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ,
and said to him , D@@ o you know that Ba@@ al@@ is the king of the children of Am@@ mon has sent I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah to take your life ? but G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe them .
now it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they ate bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and killed him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also killed all the Jews who were with him , with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were found there , the men of war .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah killed them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el had carried away cap@@ tive from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah turned about and came back , and went to Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t said to them , I have heard you ; be@@ hold , I will pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h your God according to your words ; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yah@@ we@@ h shall answer you , I will declare it to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be ev@@ il , we will obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up ; for I gri@@ eve over the dist@@ ress that I have brought on you .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
now therefore hear the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , O re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h : thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
then it shall happen , that the s@@ word , which you fear , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt ; and the fam@@ ine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully against your own so@@ ul@@ s ; for you sent me to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , saying , pra@@ y for us to Yah@@ we@@ h our God ; and according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Yah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mort@@ ar in the bri@@ ck work , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at Mem@@ p@@ his , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
however I sent to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them , saying , O@@ h , don '@@ t do this ab@@ omin@@ able thing that I h@@ ate .
therefore my wr@@ ath and my an@@ ger was p@@ oured forth , and was kin@@ d@@ led in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ; and they are was@@ ted and de@@ so@@ late , as it is this day .
have you forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves which they committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish those who d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
then all the men who knew that their wi@@ ves burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt , in P@@ ath@@ ros , answ@@ ered Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incen@@ se to the qu@@ een of the sky , and po@@ uring out drink offer@@ ings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
so that Yah@@ we@@ h could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without inhabi@@ tant , as it is this day .
be@@ hold , I watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good ; and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h who are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t spoke to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he wrote these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
of Egypt : concerning the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
har@@ ness the hor@@ ses , and get up , you hor@@ se@@ men , and stand forth with your hel@@ me@@ ts ; fur@@ b@@ ish the spe@@ ars , put on the co@@ ats of mail .
why have I seen it ? they are dis@@ may@@ ed and are turned back@@ ward ; and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and have fled Ap@@ ace , and don '@@ t look back : terror is on every side , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
Egypt rises up like the N@@ ile , and his waters Tos@@ s themselves like the rivers : and he says , I will rise up , I will cover the ear@@ th ; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants .
go up , you hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , you char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men go forth : C@@ ush and P@@ ut , who handle the shield ; and the Lu@@ dim , who handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
the nations have heard of your sh@@ ame , and the ear@@ th is full of your cry ; for the m@@ igh@@ ty man has stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , how that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on should come and strike the land of Egypt .
he made many to st@@ um@@ ble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men in the mid@@ st of her are like cal@@ ves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand : for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity has come on them , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the sound of it shall go like the ser@@ p@@ ent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with ax@@ es , as wood cut@@ ters .
the daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , says : be@@ hold , I will punish Am@@ on of No , and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and Egypt , with her go@@ ds , and her kings ; even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and those who trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but don '@@ t you be afraid , Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed , Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save you from af@@ ar , and your se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong ones , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers don '@@ t look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
for by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with contin@@ ual we@@ eping shall they go up ; for at the des@@ cent of Hor@@ on@@ aim they have heard the dist@@ ress of the cry of destruction .
Mo@@ a@@ b has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his le@@ es , and has not been emp@@ tied from ves@@ sel to ves@@ sel , neither has he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his tas@@ te remains in him , and his s@@ cent is not changed .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will send to him those who p@@ our off , and they shall p@@ our him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les in pieces .
Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the sla@@ ughter , says the King , whose name is Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
you inhabitants of Mo@@ a@@ b , leave the cities , and d@@ well in the rock ; and be like the do@@ ve that makes her n@@ est over the m@@ outh of the ab@@ y@@ ss .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b . he is very proud ; his lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of his heart .
with more than the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er will I we@@ ep for you , v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of Jaz@@ er : on your summer fru@@ its and on your vin@@ t@@ age the destro@@ yer is fallen .
from the cry of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon even to Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , even to Ja@@ haz have they ut@@ tered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even to Hor@@ on@@ aim , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah : for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim also shall become de@@ so@@ late .
moreover I will cause to ce@@ ase in Mo@@ a@@ b , says Yah@@ we@@ h , him who offers in the high place , and him who bur@@ ns incen@@ se to his go@@ ds .
on all the hous@@ et@@ ops of Mo@@ a@@ b and in its streets there is lament@@ ation every where ; for I have broken Mo@@ a@@ b like a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th is taken , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds are seized , and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
he who fle@@ es from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he who gets up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring on him , even on Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon ; for a fire is gone forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and has dev@@ oured the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
be@@ hold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
flee , turn back , d@@ well in the dep@@ ths , inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the cal@@ am@@ ity of E@@ sa@@ u on him , the time that I shall visit him .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neigh@@ b@@ ors ; and he is no more .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , they to whom it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t per@@ tain to drink of the c@@ up shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go un@@ punished ? you shall not go un@@ punished , but you shall su@@ rely drink .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles at the no@@ ise of their fall ; there is a cry , the no@@ ise which is heard in the Red Sea .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread out his w@@ ings against Boz@@ ra@@ h : and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
Dam@@ as@@ cus has grown fe@@ e@@ ble , she turns her@@ self to flee , and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling has seized on her : an@@ gu@@ ish and sor@@ ro@@ ws have taken hold of her , as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to sil@@ ence in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
their ten@@ ts and their f@@ loc@@ ks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their cur@@ tains , and all their vessels , and their ca@@ me@@ ls ; and they shall cry to them , Ter@@ ror on every side !
their ca@@ me@@ ls shall be a bo@@ o@@ ty , and the multi@@ tude of their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck a sp@@ oil : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter to all winds those who have the cor@@ ners of their be@@ ards cut off ; and I will bring their cal@@ am@@ ity from every side of them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t concerning E@@ lam , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
on E@@ lam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will sc@@ at@@ ter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the out@@ casts of E@@ lam shall not come .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
in those days , and in that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h together ; they shall go on their way we@@ eping , and shall seek Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
they shall inqu@@ ire concerning Z@@ ion with their faces turned toward it , saying , C@@ ome , and join yo@@ ur@@ selves to Yah@@ we@@ h in an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that shall not be forgotten .
my people have been lost she@@ ep : their she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds have caused them to go as@@ tra@@ y ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and go forth out of the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and be as the male go@@ ats before the f@@ loc@@ ks .
because you are glad , because you re@@ jo@@ ice , O you who pl@@ under my heritage , because you are wan@@ ton as a he@@ if@@ er that t@@ reads out the gra@@ in , and ne@@ igh as strong hor@@ ses ;
your mother shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly disappointed ; she who b@@ ore you shall be con@@ founded : be@@ hold , she shall be the least of the nations , a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
because of the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly de@@ so@@ late : everyone who goes by Bab@@ yl@@ on shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and his@@ s at all her plagu@@ es .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him who hand@@ les the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hun@@ ted she@@ ep ; the li@@ ons have driven him away : first , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a dev@@ oured him ; and now at last Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on has broken his b@@ ones .
I will bring Israel again to his pas@@ ture , and he shall fe@@ ed on Car@@ mel and B@@ ash@@ an , and his sou@@ l shall be satisfied on the hil@@ ls of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
in those days , and in that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sin@@ s of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall not be found : for I will par@@ don them whom I leave as a re@@ mn@@ ant .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pek@@ od : kill and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy after them , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Bab@@ yl@@ on , and you w@@ eren '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h has opened his arm@@ ory , and has brought forth the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation ; for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , has a work to do in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
kill all her bul@@ ls ; let them go down to the sla@@ ughter : wo@@ e to them ! for their day has come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to sil@@ ence in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the proud one shall st@@ um@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kin@@ dle a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all who are around him .
a s@@ word is on their hor@@ ses , and on their char@@ i@@ ots , and on all the mixed people who are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is on her treasures , and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dri@@ ed up ; for it is a land of en@@ gra@@ ved images , and they are ma@@ d over id@@ ols .
therefore the wild animals of the de@@ sert with the w@@ ol@@ ves shall d@@ well there , and the os@@ tri@@ ches shall d@@ well there@@ in : and it shall be no more inhabited fore@@ ver ; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation .
be@@ hold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be s@@ tir@@ red up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th .
they lay hold on bo@@ w and spe@@ ar ; they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy ; their voice ro@@ ars like the sea ; and they ride on hor@@ ses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on has heard the news of them , and his hands wa@@ x fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish has taken hold of him , pain@@ s as of a woman in la@@ bor .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , even the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
I will send to Bab@@ yl@@ on st@@ ran@@ gers , who shall win@@ now her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who ben@@ ds let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him who lif@@ ts himself up in his co@@ at of mail : and don '@@ t spar@@ e her young men ; ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all her army .
for Israel is not for@@ sak@@ en , nor Ju@@ da@@ h , of his God , of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ; though their land is full of guil@@ t against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Yah@@ we@@ h 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der to her a re@@ compen@@ se .
Bab@@ yl@@ on has been a golden c@@ up in Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand , who made all the ear@@ th dr@@ un@@ ken : the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of her wine ; therefore the nations are ma@@ d .
we would have he@@ aled Bab@@ yl@@ on , but she is not he@@ aled : for@@ sake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heav@@ en , and is lifted up even to the sk@@ ies .
make sharp the ar@@ ro@@ ws ; hold firm the shi@@ elds : Yah@@ we@@ h has s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of the kings of the Me@@ des ; because his purpose is against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to destroy it : for it is the ven@@ ge@@ ance of Yah@@ we@@ h , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
he has made the ear@@ th by his power , he has established the world by his wis@@ dom , and by his understanding has he stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens :
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ ning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
every man has become bru@@ tish without knowledge . every gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h is disappointed by his image ; for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tri@@ be of his inher@@ it@@ ance : Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name .
you are my battle ax@@ e and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ;
and with you will I break in pieces the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the far@@ mer and his yok@@ e ; and with you will I break in pieces govern@@ ors and deputies .
be@@ hold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Yah@@ we@@ h , which destro@@ ys all the ear@@ th ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and rol@@ l you down from the ro@@ cks , and will make you a bur@@ n@@ t mountain .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Me@@ des , its govern@@ ors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their domin@@ ion .
the land tre@@ m@@ bles and is in p@@ ain ; for the purposes of Yah@@ we@@ h against Bab@@ yl@@ on do stand , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation , without inhabi@@ tant .
the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Bab@@ yl@@ on have for@@ bor@@ ne to fight , they remain in their stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; their might has failed ; they are become as women : her d@@ wel@@ ling places are set on fire ; her bars are broken .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them dr@@ un@@ ken , that they may re@@ jo@@ ice , and sle@@ ep a perpet@@ ual sle@@ ep , and not wake , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
her cities are become a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert , a land in which no man d@@ wel@@ ls , neither does any son of man pass there@@ by .
I will exec@@ ute judgment on B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he has sw@@ allowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , that I will exec@@ ute judgment on the en@@ gra@@ ved images of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and her whole land shall be con@@ founded ; and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
though Bab@@ yl@@ on should mount up to the sky , and though she should for@@ ti@@ fy the he@@ ight of her strength , yet from me shall destro@@ yers come to her , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
for Yah@@ we@@ h lays Bab@@ yl@@ on waste , and destro@@ ys out of her the great voice ; and their waves ro@@ ar like many waters ; the no@@ ise of their voice is ut@@ tered :
and say , Yah@@ we@@ h , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall d@@ well there@@ in , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be de@@ so@@ late fore@@ ver .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ one years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
for through the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h it happened in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence . Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he killed also all the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h in R@@ ib@@ lah .
he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem :
and he burned the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jer@@ usalem all around .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the poorest of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their br@@ ass to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
they also took away the po@@ ts , the sh@@ ov@@ els , the sn@@ u@@ ffers , the bas@@ ins , the sp@@ o@@ ons , and all the vessels of br@@ ass with which they minist@@ ered .
the captain of the guard took away the c@@ ups , the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , the po@@ ts , the lam@@ p@@ stands , the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the bo@@ w@@ ls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
they took the two pil@@ lars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bul@@ ls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
as for the pil@@ lars , the he@@ ight of the one pil@@ lar was E@@ igh@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of twelve cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it ; and its th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness was four fin@@ gers . it was hol@@ low .
a capital of br@@ ass was on it ; and the he@@ ight of the one capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , with network and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on the capital all around , all of br@@ ass : and the second pil@@ lar also had like these , and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck them , and put them to death at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his land .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his allow@@ ance , there was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him by the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ s bit@@ ter@@ ly in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks ; among all her lov@@ ers she has none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her ; they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; all her gates are de@@ so@@ late , her pri@@ ests do si@@ gh : her vir@@ g@@ ins are aff@@ lic@@ ted , and she her@@ self is in bit@@ ter@@ ness .
from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her maj@@ es@@ ty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
her fil@@ th@@ iness was in her sk@@ ir@@ ts ; she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down won@@ der@@ fully ; she has no comfor@@ ter : see , Yah@@ we@@ h , my aff@@ li@@ ction ; for the enemy has mag@@ ni@@ fied himself .
the ad@@ versary has spread out his hand on all her pleas@@ ant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , concerning whom you comman@@ ded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my b@@ ones , and it prev@@ ails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me de@@ so@@ late and fa@@ int all the day .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand ; They are k@@ n@@ it together , they have come up on my nec@@ k ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
for these things I we@@ ep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Bec@@ ause the comfor@@ ter who should ref@@ res@@ h my sou@@ l is far from me : my children are de@@ so@@ late , because the enemy has prev@@ ailed .
Z@@ ion sp@@ reads forth her hands ; there is none to comfor@@ t her ; Yah@@ we@@ h has comman@@ ded concerning Jac@@ o@@ b , that those who are around him should be his ad@@ vers@@ aries : Jer@@ usalem is among them as an un@@ clean thing .
I called for my lov@@ ers , but they dec@@ e@@ ived me : my pri@@ ests and my el@@ ders gave up the spirit in the city , Wh@@ ile they sought them food to ref@@ res@@ h their so@@ ul@@ s .
let all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess come before you ; D@@ o to them , as you have done to me for all my trans@@ gres@@ sions : for my si@@ gh@@ s are many , and my heart is fa@@ int .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger ! he has cast down from heav@@ en to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , An@@ d has@@ n '@@ t remember@@ ed his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger .
the Lord has sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has thrown down in his wr@@ ath the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has prof@@ an@@ ed the k@@ ing@@ dom and its pr@@ inces .
he has cut off in fierce an@@ ger all the Hor@@ n of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jac@@ o@@ b like a f@@ laming fire , which dev@@ ours all around .
he has b@@ ent his bo@@ w like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an ad@@ versary , H@@ as killed all that were pleas@@ ant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Z@@ ion he has p@@ oured out his wr@@ ath like fire .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has sw@@ allowed up Israel ; He has sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces , he has destroyed his stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; He has multi@@ p@@ lied in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the Lord has cast off his alt@@ ar , he has ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces : they have made a no@@ ise in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n assembly .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit on the ground , they keep sil@@ ence ; They have cast up d@@ ust on their heads ; they have clo@@ th@@ ed themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my heart is troubled ; My li@@ ver is p@@ oured on the ear@@ th , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Bec@@ ause the young children and the inf@@ ants s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
they tell their mothers , W@@ here is gra@@ in and wine ? when they s@@ wo@@ on as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their sou@@ l is p@@ oured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
your pro@@ ph@@ ets have seen for you false and fo@@ ol@@ ish visions ; They have not uncovered your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , to bring back your cap@@ tivity , but have seen for you false or@@ ac@@ les and causes of ban@@ is@@ hment .
all your enem@@ ies have opened their m@@ outh wide against you ; They his@@ s and gn@@ ash the te@@ eth ; they say , We have sw@@ allowed her up ; Cer@@ tain@@ ly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
Yah@@ we@@ h has done that which he pur@@ posed ; he has fulfilled his word that he comman@@ ded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has caused the enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over you ; he has ex@@ al@@ ted the Hor@@ n of your ad@@ vers@@ aries .
their heart cri@@ ed to the Lord : Wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night ; Gi@@ ve yo@@ ur@@ self no res@@ p@@ ite ; don '@@ t let the app@@ le of your eye ce@@ ase .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the wat@@ ches ; p@@ our out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that fa@@ int for hunger at the head of every street .
look , Yah@@ we@@ h , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are d@@ and@@ led in the hands ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be killed in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word : you have killed them in the day of your an@@ ger ; you have sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me de@@ so@@ late .
let him put his m@@ outh in the d@@ ust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his che@@ ek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with re@@ pro@@ ach .
you will ren@@ der to them a re@@ compen@@ se , Yah@@ we@@ h , according to the work of their hands .
how the gold has become dim ! the most p@@ ure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary are p@@ oured out at the head of every street .
even the j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s draw out the bre@@ ast , they nur@@ se their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cru@@ el , like the os@@ tri@@ ches in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the ton@@ gue of the nur@@ sing child cl@@ ings to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her no@@ bles were pu@@ rer than snow , they were w@@ hi@@ ter than milk ; They were more ru@@ d@@ dy in body than ru@@ bies , their polis@@ hing was as of sap@@ ph@@ ire .
their appearance is bla@@ cker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their s@@ kin cl@@ ings to their b@@ ones ; it is with@@ ered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the s@@ word are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through , for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have bo@@ iled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yah@@ we@@ h has accomplished his wr@@ ath , he has p@@ oured out his fierce an@@ ger ; He has kin@@ d@@ led a fire in Z@@ ion , which has dev@@ oured its foundations .
the kings of the ear@@ th di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe , neither all the inhabitants of the world , That the ad@@ versary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
it is because of the sin@@ s of her pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of her pri@@ ests , That have shed the blood of the just in the mid@@ st of her .
they w@@ ander as b@@ lin@@ d men in the streets , they are pollu@@ ted with blood , S@@ o that men can '@@ t touch their gar@@ ments .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h has sc@@ at@@ tered them ; he will no more regard them : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect the persons of the pri@@ ests , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fav@@ or the el@@ ders .
they hunt our steps , so that we can '@@ t go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursu@@ ers were swi@@ f@@ ter than the e@@ ag@@ les of the sky : they ch@@ ased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ well in the land of U@@ z : the c@@ up shall pass through to you also ; you shall be dr@@ un@@ ken , and shall make yo@@ ur@@ self nak@@ ed .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its mid@@ st came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . this was their appearance : they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot ; and they spar@@ k@@ led like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
they had the hands of a man under their w@@ ings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their w@@ ings thus :
their w@@ ings were joined one to another ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn when they went ; each one went stra@@ ight forward .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , like the appearance of tor@@ ches : the fire went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
now as I saw the living cre@@ atures , be@@ hold , one whe@@ el on the ear@@ th bes@@ ide the living cre@@ atures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like a ber@@ y@@ l : and the four of them had one lik@@ eness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el within a whe@@ el .
as for their ri@@ ms , they were high and d@@ read@@ ful ; and the four of them had their ri@@ ms full of eyes all around .
wher@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them ; for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
over the head of the living cre@@ ature there was the lik@@ eness of an exp@@ ans@@ e , like the aw@@ es@@ ome cr@@ y@@ st@@ al to look on , stret@@ ched forth over their heads above .
under the exp@@ ans@@ e were their w@@ ings stra@@ ight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
when they went , I heard the no@@ ise of their w@@ ings like the no@@ ise of great waters , like the voice of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , a no@@ ise of t@@ um@@ ult like the no@@ ise of an army : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
there was a voice above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward ; and from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness around him .
he said to me , Son of man , I send you to the children of Israel , to a nation of rebels who have rebel@@ led against me . they and their fa@@ thers have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me even to this very day .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house ) , yet shall know that there has been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your bel@@ ly to eat , and fill your bo@@ wel@@ s with this s@@ cr@@ oll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh .
not to many peoples of a st@@ range speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . su@@ rely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate and hard @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your e@@ ars .
go to them of the cap@@ tivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear .
I heard the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures as they touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them , even the no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was strong on me .
then I came to them of the cap@@ tivity at Tel Avi@@ v , that lived by the river C@@ he@@ bar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhel@@ med among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made you a watch@@ man to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my m@@ outh , and give them warning from me .
yet if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
then the Spiri@@ t entered into me , and set me on my feet ; and he spoke with me , and said to me , G@@ o , shut yo@@ ur@@ self inside your house .
but you , son of man , be@@ hold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bin@@ d you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your ton@@ gue stick to the ro@@ of of your m@@ outh , that you shall be m@@ ute , and shall not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
but when I speak with you , I will open your m@@ outh , and you shall tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : he who he@@ ars , let him hear ; and he who for@@ be@@ ars , let him for@@ bear : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build for@@ ts against it , and cast up a mo@@ und against it ; set camps also against it , and plant bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it all around .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for I have appointed the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred n@@ in@@ ety days : so you shall bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h : for@@ ty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
be@@ hold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty sh@@ ek@@ els a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
you , son of man , take a sharp s@@ word ; You shall take it as a Bar@@ ber 's ra@@ zor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your be@@ ard : then take balan@@ ces to we@@ igh , and divide the ha@@ ir .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebel@@ led against my ord@@ inan@@ ces in doing w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and against my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and as for my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you are turbul@@ ent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my ord@@ inan@@ ces , neither have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the mid@@ st of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of you , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you ; and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ at@@ ter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely , because you have def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all your de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all your ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish you ; neither shall my eye spar@@ e , and I also will have no p@@ ity .
when I shall send on them the ev@@ il ar@@ ro@@ ws of fam@@ ine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the fam@@ ine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to the mountains and to the hil@@ ls , to the water@@ courses and to the val@@ ley@@ s : be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word on you , and I will destroy your high places .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones around your al@@ tar@@ s .
yet will I leave a re@@ mn@@ ant , in that you shall have some that escape the s@@ word among the nations , when you shall be sc@@ at@@ tered through the countries .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : I have not said in v@@ ain that I would do this ev@@ il to them .
he who is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he who is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he who remains and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my wr@@ ath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to the land of Israel , A@@ n end : the end has come on the four cor@@ ners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my an@@ ger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
my eye shall not spar@@ e you , neither will I have p@@ ity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
your do@@ om has come to you , inhabi@@ tant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of t@@ um@@ ult , and not of jo@@ y@@ ful sh@@ ou@@ ting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly p@@ our out my wr@@ ath on you , and accomp@@ lish my an@@ ger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you ; and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , do strike .
violence has risen up into a ro@@ d of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . none of them shall remain , nor of their multi@@ tude , nor of their wealth . there shall be nothing of value among them .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
the s@@ word is outside , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and the fam@@ ine within : he who is in the field shall die with the s@@ word : and he who is in the city , fam@@ ine and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce shall dev@@ our him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mo@@ an@@ ing , every one in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall also clo@@ the themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and hor@@ ror shall cover them ; and sh@@ ame shall be on all faces , and bal@@ d@@ ness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall prof@@ ane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall prof@@ ane my secret place ; and rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and prof@@ ane it .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be prof@@ an@@ ed .
Mis@@ chief shall come on mis@@ chief , and rum@@ or shall be on rum@@ or ; and they shall seek a vision of the pro@@ phe@@ t ; but the law shall per@@ ish from the pri@@ est , and coun@@ sel from the el@@ ders .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h fell there on me .
then I saw , and be@@ hold , a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward , fire ; and from his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the pla@@ in .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , nor@@ th@@ ward of the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
he said to me , Son of man , do you see what they do ? even the great ab@@ omin@@ ations that the house of Israel do commit here , that I should go far off from my sanc@@ tu@@ ary ? but you shall again see yet other great ab@@ omin@@ ations .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ omin@@ able animals , and all the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed around on the wall .
there stood before them sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the house of Israel ; and in their mid@@ st stood Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , every man with his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and the odor of the cl@@ oud of incen@@ se went up .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women we@@ eping for Tam@@ muz .
he brought me into the in@@ ner court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and see , at the door of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five men , with their backs toward Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and their faces toward the east ; and they were wor@@ shipping the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in wr@@ ath ; my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity ; and though they cry in my e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cri@@ ed in my e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , saying , C@@ ause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark on the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry over all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that are done in its mid@@ st .
then he said to me , The in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h is exce@@ ed@@ ingly great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of per@@ version : for they say , Yah@@ we@@ h has for@@ sak@@ en the land , and Yah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see .
as for me also , my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m there appeared above them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h moun@@ ted up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory .
it came to pass , when he comman@@ ded the man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , saying , T@@ ake fire from between the wh@@ ir@@ ling whe@@ els , from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , that he went in , and stood bes@@ ide a whe@@ el .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who took it and went out .
I looked , and be@@ hold , four whe@@ els bes@@ ide the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , one whe@@ el bes@@ ide one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el bes@@ ide another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b ; and the appearance of the whe@@ els was like a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
when they went , they went in their four direc@@ tions : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn as they went .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes all around , even the whe@@ els that the four of them had .
when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m went , the whe@@ els went bes@@ ide them ; and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings to mount up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els also di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from bes@@ ide them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they moun@@ ted up , these moun@@ ted up with them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in them .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight when they went forth , and the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
as for the lik@@ eness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h fell on me , and he said to me , Spe@@ ak , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : your sla@@ in whom you have laid in its mid@@ st , they are the meat , and this is the cal@@ dr@@ on ; but you shall be brought out of its mid@@ st .
I will bring you forth out of its mid@@ st , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
you shall fall by the s@@ word ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : for you have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have you executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will gather you from the peoples , and assem@@ ble you out of the countries where you have been sc@@ at@@ tered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their f@@ les@@ h , and will give them a heart of f@@ les@@ h ;
that they may walk in my stat@@ utes , and keep my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walk@@ s after the heart of their de@@ te@@ stable things and their ab@@ omin@@ ations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
then the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els were bes@@ ide them ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spiri@@ t of God into Chal@@ de@@ a , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , you d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the rebel@@ li@@ ous house , who have eyes to see , and don '@@ t see , who have e@@ ars to hear , and don '@@ t hear ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
you shall bring forth your stu@@ ff by day in their sight , as stu@@ ff for moving ; and you shall go forth yo@@ ur@@ self at even in their sight , as when men go forth into ex@@ ile .
in their sight you shall bear it on your sho@@ ul@@ der , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don '@@ t see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for removing , and in the even I du@@ g through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and b@@ ore it on my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are ; and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the s@@ word after them .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I shall disper@@ se them among the nations , and sc@@ at@@ ter them through the countries .
tell them therefore , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will make this pro@@ ver@@ b to ce@@ ase , and they shall no more use it as a pro@@ ver@@ b in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
son of man , be@@ hold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they have seen fal@@ se@@ hood and lying div@@ ination , who say , Yah@@ we@@ h says ; but Yah@@ we@@ h has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you seen a false vision , and ha@@ ven '@@ t you spoken a lying div@@ ination , in that you say , Yah@@ we@@ h says ; but I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have s@@ educ@@ ed my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one buil@@ ds up a wall , be@@ hold , they plas@@ ter it with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h :
tell those who plas@@ ter it with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and you , great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall tear it .
be@@ hold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , W@@ here is the plas@@ ter with which you have plas@@ tered it ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will even tear it with a stor@@ my wind in my wr@@ ath ; and there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer in my an@@ ger , and great ha@@ il@@ stones in wr@@ ath to consum@@ e it .
so will I break down the wall that you have plas@@ tered with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consu@@ med in its mid@@ st : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have gri@@ ev@@ ed the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , and be sav@@ ed alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , for a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
if the pro@@ phe@@ t is dec@@ e@@ ived and speak a word , I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have dec@@ e@@ ived that pro@@ phe@@ t , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the mid@@ st of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more as@@ tra@@ y from me , neither def@@ ile themselves any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
if I cause ev@@ il animals to pass through the land , and they rav@@ age it , and it be made de@@ so@@ late , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
though No@@ ah , Daniel , and Jo@@ b , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own so@@ ul@@ s by their righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
they shall comfor@@ t you , when you see their way and their do@@ ings ; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has dev@@ oured both its ends , and its mid@@ st is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has dev@@ oured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall dev@@ our them ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I set my face against them .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to Jer@@ usalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite ; the Am@@ or@@ ite was your father , and your mother was a H@@ itti@@ te .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your nav@@ el was not cut , neither were you was@@ hed in water to cleans@@ e you ; you w@@ eren '@@ t sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
no eye p@@ iti@@ ed you , to do any of these things to you , to have comp@@ as@@ sion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was ab@@ hor@@ red , in the day that you were born .
when I passed by you , and saw you w@@ allowing in your blood , I said to you , Th@@ ough you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Th@@ ough you are in your blood , live .
I caused you to multi@@ ply as that which gro@@ ws in the field , and you increased and grew great , and you at@@ tained to excellent or@@ nament ; your bre@@ asts were fas@@ hi@@ oned , and your ha@@ ir was grown ; yet you were nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
then was@@ hed I you with water ; yes , I thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly was@@ hed away your blood from you , and I ano@@ in@@ ted you with oil .
thus you were dec@@ ked with gold and silver ; and your clo@@ thing was of fine lin@@ en , and sil@@ k , and em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work ; you ate fine fl@@ our , and hon@@ ey , and oil ; and you were exceeding beautiful , and you prosp@@ ered to royal estate .
you took of your gar@@ ments , and made for yo@@ ur@@ selves high places dec@@ ked with various col@@ ors , and played the pro@@ stitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
you also took your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yo@@ ur@@ self images of men , and played the pro@@ stitute with them ;
my bread also which I gave you , fine fl@@ our , and oil , and hon@@ ey , with which I f@@ ed you , you even set it before them for a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a ; and [ thus ] it was , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
moreover you have taken your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom you have bor@@ ne to me , and you have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed these to them to be dev@@ oured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have sla@@ in my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your ab@@ omin@@ ations and your prostitution you have not remember@@ ed the days of your youth , when you were nak@@ ed and b@@ are , and were w@@ allowing in your blood .
you have built your lo@@ f@@ ty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an ab@@ omin@@ ation , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , your neigh@@ b@@ ors , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and have multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
you have played the pro@@ stitute also with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , because you were ins@@ ati@@ able ; yes , you have played the pro@@ stitute with them , and yet you w@@ eren '@@ t satisfied .
you have moreover multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution to the land of mer@@ chan@@ ts , to Chal@@ de@@ a ; and yet you w@@ eren '@@ t satisfied with this .
in that you build your va@@ ulted place at the head of every way , and make your lo@@ f@@ ty place in every street , and have not been as a pro@@ stitute , in that you scor@@ n pay .
they give gifts to all pro@@ stitu@@ tes ; but you give your gifts to all your lov@@ ers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
you are different from [ other ] women in your prostitution , in that no one follows you to play the pro@@ stitute ; and whereas you give h@@ ire , and no h@@ ire is given to you , therefore you are different .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , Bec@@ ause your fil@@ th@@ iness was p@@ oured out , and your nak@@ edn@@ ess uncovered through your prostitution with your lov@@ ers ; and because of all the id@@ ols of your ab@@ omin@@ ations , and for the blood of your children , that you gave to them ;
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your va@@ ulted place , and break down your lo@@ f@@ ty places ; and they shall stri@@ p you of your clo@@ th@@ es , and take your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s ; and they shall leave you nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and th@@ rust you through with their s@@ words .
they shall bur@@ n your houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to ce@@ ase from playing the pro@@ stitute , and you shall also give no h@@ ire any more .
so will I cause my wr@@ ath toward you to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
be@@ hold , everyone who uses Pro@@ ver@@ bs shall use [ this ] pro@@ ver@@ b against you , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
you are the daughter of your mother , who lo@@ ath@@ es her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your s@@ ist@@ ers , who lo@@ ath@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was a H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
your el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your left hand , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , So@@ dom your sister has not done , she nor her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , as you have done , you and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , ful@@ l@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither has Samar@@ ia committed half of your sin@@ s ; but you have multi@@ p@@ lied your ab@@ omin@@ ations more than they , and have justified your s@@ ist@@ ers by all your ab@@ omin@@ ations which you have done .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their mid@@ st ;
that you may bear your own sh@@ ame , and may be as@@ ha@@ med because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfor@@ t to them .
your s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
then you shall remember your ways , and be as@@ ha@@ med , when you shall receive your s@@ ist@@ ers , your el@@ der [ s@@ ist@@ ers ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , but not by your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
that you may remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open your m@@ outh any more , because of your sh@@ ame , when I have for@@ given you all that you have done , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
he cro@@ pped off the top@@ most of the young tw@@ ig@@ s of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
he took also of the se@@ ed of the land , and plan@@ ted it in a fruit@@ ful soil ; he placed it bes@@ ide many waters ; he set it as a w@@ il@@ low tree .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
and he took of the se@@ ed royal , and made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the m@@ igh@@ ty of the land ;
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely in the place where the king d@@ wel@@ ls who made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant he broke , even with him in the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on he shall die .
for he has desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and be@@ hold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : as I live , su@@ rely my oath that he has desp@@ ised , and my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he has broken , I will even bring it on his own head .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will enter into judgment with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he has t@@ res@@ passed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the s@@ word , and those who remain shall be sc@@ at@@ tered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and bear fruit , and be a good@@ ly c@@ ed@@ ar : and under it shall d@@ well all birds of every wing ; in the sha@@ de of its branches shall they d@@ well .
what do you mean , that you use this pro@@ ver@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge ?
be@@ hold , all so@@ ul@@ s are mine ; as the sou@@ l of the father , so also the sou@@ l of the son is mine : the sou@@ l who sin@@ s , he shall die .
and has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither has def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
and has not wron@@ ged any , but has restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , has taken nothing by rob@@ bery , has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has wron@@ ged the poor and ne@@ edy , has taken by rob@@ bery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols , has committed ab@@ omin@@ ation ,
who has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , has not def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife ,
neither has wron@@ ged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by rob@@ bery , but has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , has walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , ro@@ bbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , be@@ hold , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked turn from all his sin@@ s that he has committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
none of his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed shall be remember@@ ed against him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he has done he shall live .
again , when the w@@ ic@@ ked man turns away from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess that he has committed , and does that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall save his sou@@ l alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make yo@@ ur@@ self a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their p@@ it ; and they brought him with ho@@ oks to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had w@@ aited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her c@@ ub@@ s , and made him a young lion .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their p@@ it .
they put him in a c@@ age with ho@@ oks , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; they brought him into stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it had strong ro@@ ds for the scep@@ ters of those who b@@ ore rule , and their stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and they were seen in their he@@ ight with the multi@@ tude of their branches .
but it was p@@ lu@@ cked up in fur@@ y , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dri@@ ed up its fruit : its strong ro@@ ds were broken off and with@@ ered ; the fire consu@@ med them .
fire is gone out of the ro@@ ds of its branches , it has dev@@ oured its fruit , so that there is in it no strong ro@@ d to be a scep@@ ter to rule . this is a lament@@ ation , and shall be for a lament@@ ation .
it happened in the seventh year , in the fifth [ month ] , the tenth [ day ] of the month , that certain of the el@@ ders of Israel came to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , and sat before me .
son of man , speak to the el@@ ders of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : is it to inqu@@ ire of me that you have come ? as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , I will not be inqu@@ ired of by you .
and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day when I chose Israel , and s@@ wor@@ e to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I s@@ wor@@ e to them , saying , I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ;
in that day I s@@ wor@@ e to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the ab@@ omin@@ ations of his eyes , and don '@@ t def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with the id@@ ols of Egypt ; I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
I gave them my stat@@ utes , and showed them my ord@@ inan@@ ces , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
moreover also I gave them my Sab@@ ba@@ ths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h who sanc@@ ti@@ fies them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t walk in my stat@@ utes , and prof@@ an@@ ed my Sab@@ ba@@ ths : for their heart went after their id@@ ols .
nevertheless my eye spar@@ ed them , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
I said to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , D@@ on '@@ t walk in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their ord@@ inan@@ ces , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would sc@@ at@@ ter them among the nations , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but had rejected my stat@@ utes , and had prof@@ an@@ ed my Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and their eyes were after their fa@@ thers ' id@@ ols .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in this moreover have your fa@@ thers b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out , will I be king over you :
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out ;
and I will bring you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fa@@ thers in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and those who dis@@ obe@@ y against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
for in my hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the first fru@@ its of your offer@@ ings , with all your hol@@ y things .
as a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been sc@@ at@@ tered ; and I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in you in the sight of the nations .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I s@@ wor@@ e to give to your fa@@ thers .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , in which you have pollu@@ ted yo@@ ur@@ selves ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that you have committed .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your ev@@ il ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the forest of the field in the South ;
then I said , A@@ h Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ! they say of me , Is@@ n '@@ t he a speaker of par@@ ables ?
and tell the land of Israel , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against you , and will draw forth my s@@ word out of its she@@ ath , and will cut off from you the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked , therefore shall my s@@ word go forth out of its she@@ ath against all f@@ les@@ h from the south to the north :
it is shar@@ pen@@ ed that it may make a sla@@ ughter ; it is fur@@ b@@ ished that it may be as ligh@@ t@@ ning : shall we then make mir@@ th ? the ro@@ d of my son , it condem@@ ns every tree .
it is given to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : the s@@ word , it is shar@@ pen@@ ed , yes , it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the kil@@ ler .
cry and wa@@ il , son of man ; for it is on my people , it is on all the pr@@ inces of Israel : they are delivered over to the s@@ word with my people ; strike therefore on your th@@ igh .
I have set the threatening s@@ word against all their gates , that their heart may mel@@ t , and their stumb@@ lings be multi@@ p@@ lied : ah ! it is made as ligh@@ t@@ ning , it is pointed for sla@@ ughter .
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
it shall be to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , who have sworn o@@ aths to them ; but he brings in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to memory , that they may be taken .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : remove the tur@@ ban , and take off the cro@@ wn ; this [ shall be ] no more the same ; ex@@ alt that which is low , and ab@@ ase that which is high .
I will over@@ turn , over@@ turn , over@@ turn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its she@@ ath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will p@@ our out my in@@ dign@@ ation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wr@@ ath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful to destroy .
you shall be for fuel to the fire ; your blood shall be in the mid@@ st of the land ; you shall be remember@@ ed no more : for I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
you shall say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : a city that sh@@ eds blood in the mid@@ st of her , that her time may come , and that makes id@@ ols against her@@ self to def@@ ile her !
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the mid@@ st of you have they dealt by op@@ pression with the foreig@@ ner ; in you have they wron@@ ged the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
one has committed ab@@ omin@@ ation with his neigh@@ bor 's wife ; and another has le@@ w@@ dly def@@ iled his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; and another in you has hum@@ b@@ led his sister , his father 's daughter .
be@@ hold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dis@@ honest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the mid@@ st of you .
can your heart en@@ dur@@ e , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter you among the nations , and disper@@ se you through the countries ; and I will consum@@ e your fil@@ th@@ iness out of you .
you shall be prof@@ an@@ ed in yo@@ ur@@ self , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dro@@ ss to me : all of them are br@@ ass and tin and iron and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are the dro@@ ss of silver .
as silver is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace , so you will be mel@@ ted in its mid@@ st ; and you will know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have p@@ oured out my wr@@ ath on you .
there is a con@@ spir@@ acy of her pro@@ ph@@ ets in its mid@@ st , like a ro@@ aring lion ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y : they have dev@@ oured so@@ ul@@ s ; they take treasure and pre@@ ci@@ ous things ; they have made her wi@@ dows many in its mid@@ st .
her pr@@ inces in its mid@@ st are like w@@ ol@@ ves ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy so@@ ul@@ s , that they may get dis@@ honest gain .
therefore have I p@@ oured out my in@@ dign@@ ation on them ; I have consu@@ med them with the fire of my wr@@ ath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
and they played the pro@@ stitute in Egypt ; they played the pro@@ stitute in their youth ; there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there was handled the bos@@ om of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
their names were O@@ ho@@ lah the el@@ der , and O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah her sister : and they became mine , and they b@@ ore sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . as for their names , Samar@@ ia is O@@ ho@@ lah , and Jer@@ usalem O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah .
she bes@@ to@@ wed her prostitution on them , the cho@@ ic@@ est men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a all of them ; and on who@@ ever she do@@ ted , with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ gin@@ ity ; and they p@@ oured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; they took her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and her they killed with the s@@ word : and she became a by@@ word among women ; for they executed judg@@ ments on her .
her sister O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her do@@ ting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess : then my sou@@ l was ali@@ en@@ ated from her , like as my sou@@ l was ali@@ en@@ ated from her sister .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her prostitution , remember@@ ing the days of her youth , in which she had played the pro@@ stitute in the land of Egypt .
she do@@ ted on their param@@ ours , whose f@@ les@@ h is as the f@@ les@@ h of don@@ ke@@ ys , and whose issue is like the issue of hor@@ ses .
therefore , O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will raise up your lov@@ ers against you , from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians and all the Chal@@ de@@ ans , Pek@@ od and Sho@@ a and Ko@@ a , [ and ] all the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans with them ; desi@@ ra@@ ble young men , govern@@ ors and rul@@ ers all of them , pr@@ inces and men of ren@@ own , all of them ri@@ ding on hor@@ ses .
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you h@@ ate , into the hand of them from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated ;
you shall be filled with dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness and sor@@ row , with the c@@ up of ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment and de@@ so@@ lation , with the c@@ up of your sister Samar@@ ia .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ a@@ w the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your bre@@ asts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
for they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ ore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be dev@@ oured .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a mes@@ sen@@ ger was sent , and be@@ hold , they came ; for whom you did was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ self , pain@@ t your eyes , and decor@@ ate yo@@ ur@@ self with or@@ nam@@ ents ,
they went in to her , as they go in to a pro@@ stitute : so went they in to O@@ ho@@ lah and to O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tos@@ sed back and forth and ro@@ bbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall kill their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and also a p@@ ile [ of wood ] for the b@@ ones under [ the cal@@ dr@@ on ] ; make it bo@@ il well ; yes , let its b@@ ones be bo@@ iled in its mid@@ st .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city , to the cal@@ dr@@ on whose rust is there@@ in , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
for her blood is in the mid@@ st of her ; she set it on the b@@ are rock ; she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t p@@ our it on the ground , to cover it with d@@ ust .
that it may cause wr@@ ath to come up to take ven@@ ge@@ ance , I have set her blood on the b@@ are rock , that it should not be covered .
he@@ ap on the wood , make the fire hot , bo@@ il well the f@@ les@@ h , and make th@@ ick the bro@@ th , and let the b@@ ones be burned .
then set it empty on its co@@ als , that it may be hot , and its br@@ ass may bur@@ n , and that its fil@@ th@@ iness may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that its rust may be consu@@ med .
she has we@@ ar@@ ied [ her@@ self ] with to@@ il ; yet her great rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go forth out of her ; her rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t [ go forth ] by fire .
in your fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have cleans@@ ed you and you w@@ eren '@@ t cleans@@ ed , you shall not be cleans@@ ed from your fil@@ th@@ iness any more , until I have caused my wr@@ ath toward you to rest .
son of man , be@@ hold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stro@@ ke : yet you shall neither mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall your te@@ ars run down .
si@@ gh , but not al@@ oud , make no mourning for the dead ; bin@@ d your he@@ address on you , and put your sho@@ es on your feet , and don '@@ t cover your li@@ ps , and don '@@ t eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was comman@@ ded .
your ti@@ res shall be on your heads , and your sho@@ es on your feet : you shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but you shall p@@ ine away in your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mo@@ an one toward another .
in that day your m@@ outh will be opened to him who has escaped , and you shall speak , and be no more m@@ ute : so you will be a sign to them ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their en@@ camp@@ ments in you , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you have cla@@ pped your hands , and st@@ amp@@ ed with the feet , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with all the despite of your sou@@ l against the land of Israel ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth J@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al Me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Am@@ mon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Am@@ mon may not be remember@@ ed among the nations .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because E@@ dom has dealt against the house of Ju@@ da@@ h by taking ven@@ ge@@ ance , and has greatly off@@ ended , and reven@@ ged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , I will stretch out my hand on E@@ dom , and will cut off man and animal from it ; and I will make it de@@ so@@ late from Tem@@ an ; even to D@@ ed@@ an shall they fall by the s@@ word .
I will lay my ven@@ ge@@ ance on E@@ dom by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in E@@ dom according to my an@@ ger and according to my wr@@ ath ; and they shall know my ven@@ ge@@ ance , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will stretch out my hand on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and I will cut off the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and destroy the re@@ mn@@ ant of the sea coast .
it happened in the ele@@ venth year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I am against you , T@@ y@@ re , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
she shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will bring on T@@ y@@ re Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , king of kings , from the north , with hor@@ ses , and with char@@ i@@ ots , and with hor@@ se@@ men , and a company , and many people .
he shall kill your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the field with the s@@ word ; and he shall make for@@ ts against you , and cast up a mo@@ und against you , and raise up the bu@@ ck@@ ler against you .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the s@@ word ; and the pil@@ lars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a sp@@ oil of your ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleas@@ ant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your tim@@ ber and your d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the waters .
I will cause the no@@ ise of your songs to ce@@ ase ; and the sound of your har@@ ps shall be no more heard .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to T@@ y@@ re : shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded gro@@ an , when the sla@@ ughter is made in the mid@@ st of you ?
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay aside their rob@@ es , and stri@@ p off their em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at you .
now shall the islands tre@@ m@@ ble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dis@@ may@@ ed at your departure .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : when I shall make you a de@@ so@@ late city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
and tell T@@ y@@ re , you who d@@ well at the entry of the sea , who are the mer@@ chan@@ t of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : you , T@@ y@@ re , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made your o@@ ars ; they have made your ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory in@@ laid in box@@ wood , from the islands of Kit@@ tim .
of fine lin@@ en with em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was your sa@@ il , that it might be to you for a ban@@ ner ; blue and pur@@ ple from the islands of E@@ lis@@ ha@@ h was your aw@@ ning .
the inhabitants of S@@ id@@ on and Ar@@ v@@ ad were your ro@@ wers : your wise men , T@@ y@@ re , were in you , they were your pil@@ ots .
the old men of Ge@@ bal and the wise men of it were in you your rep@@ air@@ ers of ship se@@ ams : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in you to deal in your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with your army were on your walls all around , and val@@ or@@ ous men were in your tow@@ ers ; they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds on your walls all around ; they have perf@@ ected your beauty .
Ju@@ da@@ h , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they tra@@ ded for your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and conf@@ ections , and hon@@ ey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they were the mer@@ chan@@ ts of your hand ; in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats , in these were they your mer@@ chan@@ ts .
these were your traffickers in choice war@@ es , in wrap@@ p@@ ings of blue and em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich clo@@ thing , bound with cor@@ ds and made of c@@ ed@@ ar , among your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish were your car@@ av@@ ans for your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and you were rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the heart of the seas .
all who handled the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , [ and ] all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust on their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bal@@ d for you , and clo@@ the them with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and they shall we@@ ep for you in bit@@ ter@@ ness of sou@@ l with bitter mourning .
in their w@@ ailing they shall take up a lament@@ ation for you , and la@@ ment over you , [ saying ] , Wh@@ o is there like T@@ y@@ re , like her who is brought to sil@@ ence in the mid@@ st of the sea ?
when your war@@ es went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you en@@ ri@@ ched the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of your ri@@ ches and of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the dep@@ ths of the waters , your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and all your company fell in your mid@@ st .
by your great wis@@ dom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your ri@@ ches , and your heart is lifted up because of your ri@@ ches@@ --
therefore , be@@ hold , I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers on you , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring you down to the p@@ it ; and you shall die the death of those who are sla@@ in , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you were the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the hol@@ y mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness was found in you .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have cor@@ rupted your wis@@ dom by reason of your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
for I will send p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the mid@@ st of her , with the s@@ word on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
there shall be no more a pri@@ cking bri@@ er to the house of Israel , nor a hur@@ ting Th@@ or@@ n of any that are around them , that scor@@ ned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they d@@ well in their own land which I gave to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely there@@ in ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , when I have executed judg@@ ments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twel@@ f@@ th day of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
I will put ho@@ oks in your j@@ a@@ ws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scal@@ es ; and I will bring you up out of the mid@@ st of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scal@@ es .
I 'll cast you forth into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won '@@ t be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the ear@@ th and to the birds of the sky .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and t@@ ore all their sho@@ ul@@ ders ; and when they le@@ an@@ ed on you , you broke , and paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed all of their th@@ igh@@ s . "
the land of Egypt shall be a de@@ so@@ lation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
therefore , be@@ hold , I am against you , and against your rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt an ut@@ ter waste and de@@ so@@ lation , from the to@@ wer of Sev@@ en@@ e@@ h even to the border of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
I will make the land of Egypt a de@@ so@@ lation in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a de@@ so@@ lation for@@ ty years ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries . "
and I will bring back the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the base of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will give the land of Egypt to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and he shall carry off her multi@@ tude , and take her sp@@ oil , and take her pre@@ y ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause a Hor@@ n to bu@@ d forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the m@@ outh in their mid@@ st ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
for the day is near , even the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is near ; it shall be a day of cl@@ ou@@ ds , a time of the nations .
a s@@ word shall come on Egypt , and an@@ gu@@ ish shall be in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , when the sla@@ in shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multi@@ tude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , and P@@ ut , and Lu@@ d , and all the mixed people , and Cu@@ b , and the children of the land that is al@@ lied with them , shall fall with them by the s@@ word .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : they also who up@@ hold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the to@@ wer of Sev@@ en@@ e@@ h shall they fall in it by the s@@ word , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
they shall be de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late ; and her cities shall be in the mid@@ st of the cities that are was@@ ted .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her hel@@ pers are destroyed .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from before me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid ; and there shall be an@@ gu@@ ish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , be@@ hold , it comes .
he and his people with him , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sla@@ in .
I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and will sell the land into the hand of ev@@ il men ; and I will make the land de@@ so@@ late , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause the images to ce@@ ase from Mem@@ p@@ his ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great an@@ gu@@ ish , and No shall be broken up ; and Mem@@ p@@ his [ shall have ] ad@@ vers@@ aries in the day@@ time .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
it happened in the ele@@ venth year , in the first [ month ] , in the seventh [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and be@@ hold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ he@@ aling ] medicin@@ es , to put a ban@@ da@@ ge to bin@@ d it , that it be strong to hold the s@@ word .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the s@@ word to fall out of his hand .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break the arms of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
be@@ hold , the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an was a c@@ ed@@ ar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @@@ -@@ @ like sha@@ de , and of high stat@@ ure ; and its top was among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the waters no@@ ur@@ ished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plan@@ tation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field ; and its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nes@@ ts in its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I made it beautiful by the multi@@ tude of its branches , so that all the trees of E@@ den , that were in the gar@@ den of God , en@@ vi@@ ed it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you are ex@@ al@@ ted in stat@@ ure , and he has set his top among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and his heart is lifted up in his he@@ ight ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the nations ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
S@@ tran@@ gers , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the val@@ ley@@ s his branches are fallen , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are broken by all the water@@ courses of the land ; and all the peoples of the ear@@ th are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
on his ru@@ in all the birds of the sky shall d@@ well , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into She@@ ol with him to those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the nations .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole ear@@ th with you .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you sw@@ im , even to the mountains ; and the water@@ courses shall be full of you .
when I shall ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish you , I will cover the heav@@ ens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause your multi@@ tude to fall ; the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multi@@ tude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from bes@@ ide many waters ; neither shall the fo@@ ot of man trouble them any more , nor the ho@@ of@@ s of animals trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late and waste , a land de@@ stitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the ear@@ th , with those who go down into the p@@ it .
they shall fall in the mid@@ st of those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : she is delivered to the s@@ word ; draw her away and all her multi@@ tu@@ des .
the strong among the m@@ igh@@ ty shall speak to him out of the mid@@ st of She@@ ol with those who help him : they are gone down , they lie still , even the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word .
whose graves are set in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the p@@ it , and her company is around her grave ; all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all their multi@@ tude ; their graves are around them ; all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her pr@@ inces , who in their might are laid with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the p@@ it .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multi@@ tude , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his army , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
for I have put his terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the mid@@ st of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his multi@@ tude , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the s@@ word on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watch@@ man ;
then who@@ ever he@@ ars the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t take warning , if the s@@ word come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his sou@@ l .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watch@@ man to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my m@@ outh , and give them warning from me .
when I tell the w@@ ic@@ ked , O w@@ ic@@ ked man , you shall su@@ rely die , and you don '@@ t speak to warn the w@@ ic@@ ked from his way ; that w@@ ic@@ ked man shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , but his blood will I require at your hand .
nevertheless , if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his way ; he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
when I tell the righ@@ te@@ ous , that he shall su@@ rely live ; if he trust to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , none of his righ@@ te@@ ous de@@ eds shall be remember@@ ed ; but in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity that he has committed , there@@ in shall he die .
again , when I say to the w@@ ic@@ ked , You shall su@@ rely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is law@@ ful and right ;
if the w@@ ic@@ ked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by rob@@ bery , walk in the stat@@ utes of life , committing no in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
none of his sin@@ s that he has committed shall be remember@@ ed against him : he has done that which is law@@ ful and right ; he shall su@@ rely live .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jer@@ usalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
son of man , they who in@@ ha@@ bit those waste places in the land of Israel speak , saying , Ab@@ ra@@ ham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inher@@ it@@ ance .
I will make the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment ; and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have made the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , because of all their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
be@@ hold , you are to them as a very lov@@ ely song of one who has a pleas@@ ant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don '@@ t do them .
you eat the f@@ at , and you clo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ self with the wo@@ ol , you kill the fat@@ lings ; but you don '@@ t fe@@ ed the she@@ ep .
you ha@@ ven '@@ t strengthened the dis@@ eased , neither have you he@@ aled that which was si@@ ck , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with ri@@ gor you have ruled over them .
they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were sc@@ at@@ tered .
my she@@ ep w@@ and@@ ered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my she@@ ep were sc@@ at@@ tered on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; and there was none who searched or sought .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely because my she@@ ep became a pre@@ y , and my she@@ ep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my she@@ ep , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fe@@ ed my she@@ ep ;
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I myself , even I , will search for my she@@ ep , and will seek them out .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will fe@@ ed them on the mountains of Israel , by the water@@ courses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will fe@@ ed them with good pas@@ ture ; and on the mountains of the he@@ ight of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed on the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but the f@@ at and the strong I will destroy ; I will fe@@ ed them in justice .
does it seem a small thing to you to have f@@ ed on the good pas@@ ture , but you must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ ture ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the clear waters , but you must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
as for my she@@ ep , they eat that which you have tro@@ dden with your feet , and they drink that which you have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
I will set up one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d over them , and he shall fe@@ ed them , even my ser@@ vant David ; he shall fe@@ ed them , and he shall be their she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause ev@@ il animals to ce@@ ase out of the land ; and they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in its season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the nations , neither shall the animals of the ear@@ th dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plan@@ tation for ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with fam@@ ine in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the nations any more .
and tell it , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against you , Mount Se@@ ir , and I will stretch out my hand against you , and I will make you a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment .
because you have had a perpet@@ ual en@@ mity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not ha@@ ted blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Se@@ ir an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment and a de@@ so@@ lation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its sla@@ in : in your hil@@ ls and in your val@@ ley@@ s and in all your water@@ courses shall they fall who are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have heard all your ins@@ ults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid de@@ so@@ late , they have been given us to dev@@ our .
you have mag@@ ni@@ fied yo@@ ur@@ selves against me with your m@@ outh , and have multi@@ p@@ lied your words against me : I have heard it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I have sworn , [ saying ] , su@@ rely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their sh@@ ame .
for , be@@ hold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be til@@ led and so@@ wn ;
and I will multi@@ ply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
yes , I will cause men to walk on you , even my people Israel ; and they shall poss@@ ess you , and you shall be their inher@@ it@@ ance , and you shall no more hen@@ ce@@ forth ber@@ e@@ ave them of children .
neither will I let you hear any more the sh@@ ame of the nations , neither shall you bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to st@@ um@@ ble any more , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they def@@ iled it by their way and by their do@@ ings : their way before me was as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of a woman in her imp@@ urity .
therefore I p@@ oured out my wr@@ ath on them for the blood which they had p@@ oured out on the land , and because they had def@@ iled it with their id@@ ols ;
and I sc@@ at@@ tered them among the nations , and they were disper@@ sed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I jud@@ ged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they prof@@ an@@ ed my hol@@ y name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my hol@@ y name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where they went .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I don '@@ t do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my hol@@ y name , which you have prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where you went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you a heart of f@@ les@@ h .
I will put my Spiri@@ t within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and you shall keep my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them .
you shall d@@ well in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess : and I will call for the gra@@ in , and will multi@@ ply it , and lay no fam@@ ine on you .
I will multi@@ ply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the re@@ pro@@ ach of fam@@ ine among the nations .
then you shall remember your ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day that I cleans@@ e you from all your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was de@@ so@@ late shall be til@@ led , whereas it was a de@@ so@@ lation in the sight of all who passed by .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have built the ru@@ ined places , and plan@@ ted that which was de@@ so@@ late : I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and I will do it .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : for this , moreover , will I be inqu@@ ired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them : I will increase them with men like a flock .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jer@@ usalem in her appointed fe@@ asts , so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ loc@@ ks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me out in the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley ; and it was full of b@@ ones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and be@@ hold , there were very many in the open val@@ ley ; and be@@ hold , they were very d@@ ry .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to these b@@ ones : be@@ hold , I will cause bre@@ ath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sin@@ ews on you , and will bring up f@@ les@@ h on you , and cover you with s@@ kin , and put bre@@ ath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
so I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied as I was comman@@ ded : and as I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , there was a no@@ ise , and be@@ hold , an earthquake ; and the b@@ ones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , be@@ hold , there were sin@@ ews on them , and f@@ les@@ h came up , and s@@ kin covered them above ; but there was no bre@@ ath in them .
therefore pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spiri@@ t in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it and performed it , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
you , son of man , take one stick , and write on it , For Ju@@ da@@ h , and for the children of Israel his compan@@ ions : then take another stick , and write on it , For Joseph , the stick of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and [ for ] all the house of Israel his compan@@ ions :
say to them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all ;
my ser@@ vant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : they shall also walk in my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and observe my stat@@ utes , and do them .
they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , in which your fa@@ thers lived ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , they , and their children , and their children 's children , fore@@ ver : and David my ser@@ vant shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
moreover I will make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace with them ; it shall be an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them ; and I will place them , and multi@@ ply them , and will set my sanc@@ tu@@ ary in their mid@@ st fore@@ ver@@ more .
you shall as@@ cen@@ d , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cl@@ oud to cover the land , you , and all your hor@@ des , and many peoples with you .
you shall come from your place out of the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them ri@@ ding on hor@@ ses , a great company and a m@@ igh@@ ty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , that my wr@@ ath shall come up into my nos@@ tr@@ ils .
for in my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and in the fire of my wr@@ ath have I spoken , su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shak@@ ing in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a s@@ word against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : every man 's s@@ word shall be against his brother .
with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hor@@ des , and on the many peoples who are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and sul@@ f@@ ur .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bo@@ w out of your left hand , and will cause your ar@@ ro@@ ws to fall out of your right hand .
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hor@@ des , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be dev@@ oured .
my hol@@ y name will I make known in the mid@@ st of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my hol@@ y name to be prof@@ an@@ ed any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall pl@@ under those who pl@@ under@@ ed them , and ro@@ b those who ro@@ bbed them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the under@@ tak@@ ers have buried it in the val@@ ley of Ham@@ on Go@@ g .
you shall eat f@@ at until you be full , and drink blood until you are dr@@ un@@ k , of my sacrifice which I have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for you .
I will set my gl@@ ory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into cap@@ tivity for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because they t@@ res@@ passed against me , and I hi@@ d my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their ad@@ vers@@ aries , and they fell all of them by the s@@ word .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions did I to them ; and I hi@@ d my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : now will I bring back the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b , and have mer@@ cy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Je@@ al@@ ous for my hol@@ y name .
they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and all their t@@ res@@ passes by which they have t@@ res@@ passed against me , when they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enem@@ ies ' lands , and am sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , in that I caused them to go into cap@@ tivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , where@@ on was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one Re@@ ed broad .
every lo@@ dge was one Re@@ ed long , and one Re@@ ed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lo@@ dges was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house was one Re@@ ed .
he meas@@ ured also the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house , one Re@@ ed .
then meas@@ ured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and its posts , two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cu@@ bit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cu@@ bit on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
he meas@@ ured the gate from the ro@@ of of the one lo@@ dge to the ro@@ of of the other , a b@@ read@@ th of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; door against door .
[ from ] the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the gate at the entrance to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner por@@ ch of the gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court outside , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lo@@ dges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its ar@@ ches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the windows of it , and its ar@@ ches , and the pal@@ m trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its ar@@ ches were before them .
there was a gate to the in@@ ner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he meas@@ ured from gate to gate one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its ar@@ ches were before them ; and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
and its lo@@ dges , and its posts , and its ar@@ ches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its ar@@ ches all around ; it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and its lo@@ dges , and its posts , and its ar@@ ches , according to these measures : and there were windows there@@ in and in its ar@@ ches all around ; it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
the ar@@ ches of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
in the por@@ ch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill there@@ on the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sin offering and the t@@ res@@ pass offering .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , where@@ upon they killed [ the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ] .
outside of the in@@ ner gate were rooms for the singers in the in@@ ner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the pri@@ ests , the ke@@ epers of the duty of the alt@@ ar : these are the sons of Zad@@ ok , who from among the sons of L@@ evi come near to Yah@@ we@@ h to minister to him .
then he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and meas@@ ured each post of the por@@ ch , five cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side : and the b@@ read@@ th of the gate was three cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tent .
then he meas@@ ured the wall of the house , six cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the b@@ read@@ th of every side room , four cu@@ bi@@ ts , all around the house on every side .
the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick all around , and its length n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
also the b@@ read@@ th of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he meas@@ ured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its gal@@ ler@@ ies on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the in@@ ner temp@@ le , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
the th@@ res@@ holds , and the closed windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ce@@ il@@ ings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the in@@ ner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
so that there was the face of a man toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
as for the temp@@ le , the door posts were s@@ quar@@ ed ; and as for the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temp@@ le ] .
the alt@@ ar was of wood , three cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and its length two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and its cor@@ ners , and its length , and its walls , were of wood : and he said to me , This is the table that is before Yah@@ we@@ h .
the doors had two leaves [ ap@@ i@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temp@@ le , ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m and pal@@ m trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the por@@ ch outside .
there were closed windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the th@@ res@@ holds .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
over against the twenty [ cu@@ bi@@ ts ] which belonged to the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which belonged to the ou@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in the third story .
for they were in three stories , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have pil@@ lars as the pil@@ lars of the courts : therefore [ the up@@ per@@ most ] was stra@@ it@@ ened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the in@@ ner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and meas@@ ured it all around .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spiri@@ t took me up , and brought me into the in@@ ner court ; and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their do@@ or@@ post bes@@ ide my do@@ or@@ post , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have def@@ iled my hol@@ y name by their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed : therefore I have consu@@ med them in my an@@ ger .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will d@@ well in their mid@@ st fore@@ ver .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be as@@ ha@@ med of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities ; and let them measure the pat@@ tern .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most hol@@ y . be@@ hold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th one cu@@ bit ; and from the les@@ ser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th a cu@@ bit .
the ledge shall be fo@@ ur@@ teen [ cu@@ bi@@ ts ] long by fo@@ ur@@ teen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cu@@ bit ; and its bottom shall be a cu@@ bit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
he said to me , Son of man , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : these are the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the alt@@ ar in the day when they shall make it , to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on , and to sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le blood there@@ on .
you shall give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes who are of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , a young bul@@ l for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four hor@@ ns of it , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleans@@ e it and make At@@ on@@ ement for it .
you shall also take the bul@@ l of the sin offering , and it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
you shall bring them near to Yah@@ we@@ h , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the pri@@ ests shall make your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar , and your peace offer@@ ings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
then he brought me back by the way of the ou@@ ter gate of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
as for the pr@@ ince , he shall sit there@@ in as pr@@ ince to eat bread before Yah@@ we@@ h ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and I fell on my face .
in that you have brought in foreigners , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to prof@@ ane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , [ to add ] to all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , No foreig@@ ner , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
because they minist@@ ered to them before their id@@ ols , and became a stumbling block of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , and they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall not come near to me , to exec@@ ute the office of pri@@ est to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , to the things that are most hol@@ y ; but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done there@@ in .
they shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my in@@ struction .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
they shall have lin@@ en ti@@ res on their heads , and shall have lin@@ en bre@@ eches on their wa@@ ists ; they shall not clo@@ the themselves with [ anything that causes ] swe@@ at .
neither shall they take for their wi@@ ves a wi@@ dow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take vir@@ g@@ ins of the se@@ ed of the house of Israel , or a wi@@ dow who is the wi@@ dow of a pri@@ est .
they shall te@@ ach my people the difference between the hol@@ y and the common , and cause them to dis@@ cer@@ n between the un@@ clean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ord@@ inan@@ ces shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my stat@@ utes in all my appointed fe@@ asts ; and they shall make my Sab@@ ba@@ ths hol@@ y .
they shall go in to no dead person to def@@ ile themselves ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister who has had no husband , they may def@@ ile themselves .
in the day that he goes into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , into the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
the first of all the first fru@@ its of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offer@@ ings , shall be for the pri@@ est : you shall also give to the pri@@ ests the first of your d@@ ough , to cause a b@@ les@@ sing to rest on your house .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , you shall offer an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , a hol@@ y portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand [ re@@ eds ] , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand : it shall be hol@@ y in all its border all around .
of this there shall be for the hol@@ y place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in b@@ read@@ th ] , square all around ; and fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts for its subur@@ bs all around .
it is a hol@@ y portion of the land ; it shall be for the pri@@ ests , the ministers of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , who come near to minister to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a hol@@ y place for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the hol@@ y portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my pr@@ inces shall no more op@@ press my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tri@@ bes .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the b@@ ath shall be of one measure , that the b@@ ath may contain the tenth part of a Ho@@ mer , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of a Ho@@ mer : its measure shall be after the Ho@@ mer .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h from a Ho@@ mer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h from a Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley ;
and the set portion of oil , of the b@@ ath of oil , the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , [ which is ] ten ba@@ ths , even a Ho@@ mer ; ( for ten ba@@ ths are a Ho@@ mer ; )
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h ; and you shall cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge of the alt@@ ar , and on the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who err@@ s , and for him who is simple : so you shall make At@@ on@@ ement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , you shall have the P@@ ass@@ over , a feast of seven days ; un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , seven bul@@ ls and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a male go@@ at daily for a sin offering .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the me@@ al offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : the gate of the in@@ ner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram ; they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h :
and he shall prepare a me@@ al offering , an ep@@ ha@@ h for the bul@@ l , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for the ram , and for the lam@@ bs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the pr@@ ince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y rooms for the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and be@@ hold , there was a place on the hin@@ der part w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , and caused me to pass by the four cor@@ ners of the court ; and be@@ hold , in every cor@@ ner of the court there was a court .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me round by the way outside to the ou@@ ter gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
when the man went forth eas@@ tw@@ ard with the line in his hand , he meas@@ ured one thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the an@@ k@@ les .
again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the k@@ ne@@ es . again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the wa@@ ist .
after@@ ward he meas@@ ured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to sw@@ im in , a river that could not be passed through .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
it shall happen , that fisher@@ men shall stand by it : from En Ge@@ di even to En Eg@@ la@@ im shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inher@@ it@@ ance according to the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] por@@ tions .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , to the entrance of Z@@ ed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ o@@ th@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Haz@@ er Hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the border of H@@ aur@@ an .
the south side sou@@ th@@ ward shall be from Tam@@ ar as far as the waters of Mer@@ i@@ both K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side sou@@ th@@ ward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Ham@@ ath . this is the west side .
[ it shall be ] for the pri@@ ests who are sanc@@ ti@@ fied of the sons of Zad@@ ok , who have kept my in@@ struction , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go as@@ tra@@ y when the children of Israel went as@@ tra@@ y , as the L@@ evi@@ tes went as@@ tra@@ y .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have subur@@ bs : toward the north two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred fif@@ ty .
those who la@@ bor in the city , out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , shall cultiv@@ ate it .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the pr@@ ince .
by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar to the waters of Mer@@ ib@@ ath K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one ; the gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , with their three gates : the gate of G@@ ad , one ; the gate of As@@ her , one ; the gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , one .
the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties , and of the wine which he d@@ rank , and that they should be no@@ ur@@ ished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , [ of ] Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the you@@ ths who eat of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
in every matter of wis@@ dom and understanding , concerning which the king inqu@@ ired of them , he found them ten times better than all the mag@@ ic@@ ians and en@@ chan@@ ters who were in all his real@@ m .
in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar dre@@ amed dre@@ ams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sle@@ ep went from him .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the en@@ chan@@ ters , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , to tell the king his dre@@ ams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king answ@@ ered the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if you don '@@ t make known to me the dream and its interpre@@ tation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
for this cause the king was angry and very fur@@ ious , and comman@@ ded to destroy all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be sla@@ in ; and they sought Daniel and his compan@@ ions to be sla@@ in .
then Daniel returned answer with coun@@ sel and pru@@ dence to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
Daniel went in , and desi@@ red of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpre@@ tation .
he changes the times and the se@@ as@@ ons ; he re@@ moves kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wis@@ dom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
therefore Daniel went in to Ari@@ o@@ ch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; he went and said thus to him : D@@ on '@@ t destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; bring me in before the king , and I will show to the king the interpre@@ tation .
then Ari@@ o@@ ch brought in Daniel before the king in has@@ te , and said thus to him , I have found a man of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , who will make known to the king the interpre@@ tation .
Daniel answ@@ ered before the king , and said , The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men , en@@ chan@@ ters , mag@@ ic@@ ians , nor so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , show to the king ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en who reve@@ als secre@@ ts , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your th@@ ou@@ ghts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen her@@ e@@ after ; and he who reve@@ als secre@@ ts has made known to you what shall happen .
you , O king , saw , and be@@ hold , a great image . this image , which was m@@ igh@@ ty , and whose bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was aw@@ es@@ ome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its bre@@ ast and its arms of silver , its bel@@ ly and its th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heav@@ en has given the k@@ ing@@ dom , the power , and the strength , and the gl@@ ory ;
and wher@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and sub@@ du@@ es all things ; and as iron that cr@@ us@@ hes all these , shall it break in pieces and cr@@ ush .
whereas you saw the iron mixed with mir@@ y cla@@ y , they shall min@@ gle themselves with the se@@ ed of men ; but they shall not cling to one another , even as iron does not min@@ gle with cla@@ y .
the king answ@@ ered to Daniel , and said , O@@ f a truth your God is the God of go@@ ds , and the Lord of kings , and a reve@@ al@@ er of secre@@ ts , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king made an image of gold , whose he@@ ight was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th six cu@@ bi@@ ts : he set it up in the pla@@ in of D@@ ura , in the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
that wh@@ en@@ ever you hear the sound of the Hor@@ n , fl@@ ute , z@@ ither , Ly@@ re , har@@ p , pip@@ e , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king has set up ;
and who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the mid@@ st of a burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the Hor@@ n , fl@@ ute , z@@ ither , Ly@@ re , har@@ p , pip@@ e , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and wor@@ shi@@ ped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
but if not , be it known to you , O king , that we will not serve your go@@ ds , nor worship the golden image which you have set up .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar full of fur@@ y , and the form of his appearance was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go : [ therefore ] he spoke , and comman@@ ded that they should heat the fur@@ n@@ ace seven times more than it was usually heated .
he comman@@ ded certain m@@ igh@@ ty men who were in his army to bin@@ d Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
then these men were bound in their p@@ ants , their tun@@ ics , and their man@@ t@@ les , and their [ other ] gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the th@@ ou@@ ghts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the en@@ chan@@ ters , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpre@@ tation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and be@@ hold , a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th ; and its he@@ ight was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its he@@ ight reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the ear@@ th .
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed from it .
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed , and be@@ hold , a wat@@ cher and a hol@@ y one came down from the sky .
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of its roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose he@@ ight reached to the sky , and its sight to all the ear@@ th ;
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habi@@ tation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your gre@@ at@@ ness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your domin@@ ion to the end of the ear@@ th .
whereas they comman@@ ded to leave the st@@ um@@ p of the roots of the tree ; your k@@ ing@@ dom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heav@@ ens do rule .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , which I have built for the royal d@@ wel@@ ling place , by the might of my power and for the gl@@ ory of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the k@@ ing@@ dom has depar@@ ted from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of God 's house which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king and his lor@@ ds , his wi@@ ves and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank from them .
they d@@ rank wine , and praised the go@@ ds of gold , and of silver , of br@@ ass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lam@@ p@@ stand on the plas@@ ter of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him ; and the join@@ ts of his th@@ igh@@ s were lo@@ os@@ ened , and his k@@ ne@@ es struck one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpre@@ tation .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Ar@@ e you that Daniel , who are of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom the king my father brought out of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the go@@ ds is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wis@@ dom are found in you .
now the wise men , the en@@ chan@@ ters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpre@@ tation ; but they could not show the interpre@@ tation of the thing .
and because of the gre@@ at@@ ness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and fear@@ ed before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was har@@ dened so that he dealt pro@@ u@@ dly , he was de@@ posed from his k@@ ingly th@@ r@@ one , and they took his gl@@ ory from him :
Peres ; your k@@ ing@@ dom is divided , and given to the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with pur@@ ple , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the sat@@ ra@@ ps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole real@@ m .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t al@@ ter .
then answ@@ ered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very disp@@ le@@ ased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he la@@ bo@@ red until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assemb@@ led together to the king , and said to the king , K@@ now , O king , that it is a law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , that no decree nor statute which the king establis@@ hes may be changed .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Y@@ our God whom you serve continu@@ ally , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the m@@ outh of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lor@@ ds ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sle@@ ep fled from him .
then the king ar@@ ose very early in the morning , and went in has@@ te to the den of li@@ ons .
my God has sent his an@@ gel , and has shut the li@@ ons ' m@@ ou@@ ths , and they have not hurt me ; because as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before you , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had tr@@ usted in his God .
I make a decree , that in all the domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and stead@@ fast fore@@ ver , H@@ is k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his domin@@ ion shall be even to the end .
in the first year of Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
the first was like a lion , and had e@@ ag@@ le 's w@@ ings : I saw until its w@@ ings were p@@ lu@@ cked , and it was lifted up from the ear@@ th , and made to stand on two feet as a man ; and a man 's heart was given to it .
after this I saw , and be@@ hold , another , like a Le@@ op@@ ard , which had on its back four w@@ ings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and domin@@ ion was given to it .
I saw until th@@ ron@@ es were placed , and one who was ancient of days sat : his clo@@ thing was white as snow , and the ha@@ ir of his head like p@@ ure wo@@ ol ; his th@@ r@@ one was fi@@ ery fla@@ mes , [ and ] its whe@@ els burning fire .
a fi@@ ery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands minist@@ ered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sla@@ in , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and be@@ hold , there came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
there was given him domin@@ ion , and gl@@ ory , and a k@@ ing@@ dom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his domin@@ ion is an ever@@ lasting domin@@ ion , which shall not pass away , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was gri@@ ev@@ ed in the mid@@ st of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpre@@ tation of the things .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth k@@ ing@@ dom on ear@@ th , which shall be di@@ verse from all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , and shall dev@@ our the whole ear@@ th , and shall tre@@ ad it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten hor@@ ns , out of this k@@ ing@@ dom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
in the third year of the reign of king Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
as I was considering , be@@ hold , a male go@@ at came from the west over the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t touch the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two hor@@ ns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fur@@ y of his power .
the male go@@ at mag@@ ni@@ fied himself exce@@ ed@@ ingly : and when he was strong , the great Hor@@ n was broken ; and instead of it there came up four no@@ table [ hor@@ ns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Hor@@ n , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the g@@ lor@@ ious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and tr@@ amp@@ led on them .
yes , it mag@@ ni@@ fied itself , even to the pr@@ ince of the army ; and it took away from him the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] through dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleas@@ ure ] and prosp@@ ered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was fri@@ gh@@ tened , and fell on my face : but he said to me , understand , son of man ; for the vision belongs to the time of the end .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sle@@ ep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me u@@ pri@@ ght .
the ram which you saw , that had the two hor@@ ns , they are the kings of Media and Per@@ sia .
the roug@@ h male go@@ at is the king of Greece : and the great Hor@@ n that is between his eyes is the first king .
his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er and do [ his pleas@@ ure ] ; and he shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty ones and the hol@@ y people .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosp@@ er in his hand ; and he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the pr@@ ince of pr@@ inces ; but he shall be broken without hand .
I , Daniel , fa@@ in@@ ted , and was si@@ ck certain days ; then I rose up , and did the king 's business : and I won@@ dered at the vision , but none understood it .
we have sin@@ ned , and have dealt per@@ ver@@ sely , and have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly , and have rebel@@ led , even turning aside from your prec@@ ep@@ ts and from your ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
neither have we list@@ ened to your servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
as it is written in the law of Mos@@ es , all this ev@@ il has come on us : yet have we not ent@@ re@@ ated the fav@@ or of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , that we should turn from our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and have dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment in your truth .
therefore has Yah@@ we@@ h watched over the ev@@ il , and brought it on us ; for Yah@@ we@@ h our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he does , and we have not obe@@ yed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and have gotten yo@@ ur@@ self ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and to his peti@@ tions , and cause your face to sh@@ ine on your sanc@@ tu@@ ary that is de@@ so@@ late , for the Lord 's sake .
my God , turn your e@@ ar , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our peti@@ tions before you for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but for your great mer@@ cies ' sake .
while I was speaking , and pray@@ ing , and conf@@ essing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supp@@ lic@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h my God for the hol@@ y mountain of my God ;
yes , while I was speaking in pray@@ er , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
he instruc@@ ted me , and talked with me , and said , Daniel , I am now come forth to give you wis@@ dom and understanding .
in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is H@@ idde@@ kel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , a man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , whose th@@ igh@@ s were ad@@ or@@ ned with p@@ ure gold of U@@ p@@ haz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sle@@ ep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me twenty @@@ -@@ @ one days ; but , be@@ hold , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was m@@ ute .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there bre@@ ath left in me .
then he said , " D@@ o you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the pr@@ ince of Per@@ sia . when I go forth , be@@ hold , the pr@@ ince of Greece shall come .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
but out of a sho@@ ot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail .
also their go@@ ds , with their m@@ ol@@ ten images , [ and ] with their good@@ ly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry cap@@ tive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
his sons shall war , and shall assem@@ ble a multi@@ tude of great forces , which shall come on , and over@@ flow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the king of the south shall be moved with an@@ ger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multi@@ tude , and the multi@@ tude shall be given into his hand .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multi@@ tude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much sub@@ stance .
in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the children of the violent among your people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but he who comes against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him ; and he shall stand in the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and in his hand shall be destruction .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his re@@ pro@@ ach to turn on him .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collec@@ tor to pass through the k@@ ing@@ dom to maintain its gl@@ ory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in an@@ ger , nor in battle .
in his place shall stand up a con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble person , to whom they had not given the hon@@ or of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
the overwhel@@ ming forces shall be overwhel@@ med from before him , and shall be broken ; yes , also the pr@@ ince of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
after the treaty made with him he shall work dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his da@@ in@@ ties shall destroy him , and his army shall over@@ flow ; and many shall fall down sla@@ in .
as for both these kings , their hear@@ ts shall be to do mis@@ chief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosp@@ er ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great sub@@ stance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
for ships of Kit@@ tim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and shall return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the fortress , and shall take away the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and they shall set up the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late .
such as do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly against the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall he per@@ ver@@ t by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ explo@@ its ] .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
neither shall he regard the go@@ ds of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d ; for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
but in his place shall he hon@@ or the go@@ d of for@@ t@@ resses ; and a go@@ d whom his fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know shall he hon@@ or with gold , and silver , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and pleas@@ ant things .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many [ countries ] shall be over@@ thrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt ; and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
those who are wise shall sh@@ ine as the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the exp@@ ans@@ e ; and those who turn many to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the stars fore@@ ver and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and se@@ al the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and be@@ hold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
many shall pur@@ ify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refin@@ ed ; but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; and none of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred n@@ in@@ ety days .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Hos@@ ea the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " C@@ all his name J@@ ez@@ reel ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of J@@ ez@@ reel on the house of J@@ eh@@ u , and will cause the k@@ ing@@ dom of the house of Israel to ce@@ ase .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
conten@@ d with your mother ! conten@@ d , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies from between her bre@@ asts ;
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and make her b@@ are as in the day that she was born , and make her like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and kill her with thir@@ st .
therefore be@@ hold , I will h@@ edge up your way with thor@@ ns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can '@@ t find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the gra@@ in , the new wine , and the oil , and multi@@ p@@ lied to her silver and gold , which they used for Ba@@ al .
therefore I will take back my gra@@ in in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will p@@ lu@@ ck away my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x which should have covered her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
now I will un@@ cover her le@@ w@@ d@@ ness in the sight of her lov@@ ers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
I will lay waste her v@@ ines and her fi@@ g trees , about which she has said , ' These are my wages that my lov@@ ers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , ' and the animals of the field shall eat them .
I will visit on her the days of the Ba@@ als , to which she burned incen@@ se , when she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ got me , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will give her v@@ ine@@ yards from there , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for I will take away the names of the Ba@@ als out of her m@@ outh , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me fore@@ ver . yes , I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , in justice , in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , and in comp@@ as@@ sion .
I will so@@ w her to me in the ear@@ th ; and I will have mer@@ cy on her who had not obtained mer@@ cy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without pr@@ ince , and without sacrifice , and without sac@@ red stone , and without ep@@ ho@@ d or id@@ ols .
hear the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , you children of Israel ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Go@@ od@@ ness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore the land will mour@@ n , and everyone who d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in will waste aw@@ ay@@ . all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a pri@@ est .
you will st@@ um@@ ble in the day , and the pro@@ phe@@ t will also st@@ um@@ ble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the pro@@ stitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yah@@ we@@ h .
my people cons@@ ult with their wooden i@@ dol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them as@@ tra@@ y , and they have been un@@ fa@@ ith@@ ful to their God .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they play the pro@@ stitute , nor your bri@@ des when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery ; because the men con@@ sort with pro@@ stitu@@ tes , and they sacrifice with the shr@@ ine pro@@ stitu@@ tes ; so the people without understanding will come to ru@@ in .
the wind has wrapped her up in its w@@ ings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
their de@@ eds won '@@ t allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h .
they will go with their f@@ loc@@ ks and with their her@@ ds to seek Yah@@ we@@ h ; but they won '@@ t find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will become a de@@ so@@ lation in the day of re@@ bu@@ ke . among the tri@@ bes of Israel , I have made known that which will su@@ rely be .
" when E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im saw his si@@ ck@@ ness , and Ju@@ da@@ h his wo@@ und , Th@@ en E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im went to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and sent to king J@@ are@@ b : but he is not able to he@@ al you , neither will he c@@ ure you of your wo@@ und .
for I will be to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
" come , and let us return to Yah@@ we@@ h ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will he@@ al us ; he has injured us , and he will bin@@ d up our wounds .
let us acknowledge Yah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Yah@@ we@@ h . as su@@ rely as the sun rises , Yah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the ear@@ th . "
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; I killed them with the words of my m@@ outh . your judg@@ ments are like a f@@ lash of ligh@@ t@@ ning .
when I would he@@ al Israel , then the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is uncovered , also the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Samar@@ ia ; for they commit fal@@ se@@ hood , and the th@@ i@@ ef enters in , and the gang of rob@@ bers rav@@ ages outside .
they don '@@ t consider in their hear@@ ts that I remember all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . now their own de@@ eds have eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed them . they are before my face .
they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers . they are burning like an ov@@ en that the Bak@@ er stops s@@ tir@@ ring , from the k@@ ne@@ ading of the d@@ ough , until it is le@@ av@@ ened .
they are all hot as an ov@@ en , and dev@@ our their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it . indeed , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there on him , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their Con@@ gre@@ gation has heard .
they ha@@ ven '@@ t cri@@ ed to me with their heart , but they ho@@ w@@ l on their beds . they assem@@ ble themselves for gra@@ in and new wine . they turn away from me .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made pr@@ inces , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
for they so@@ w the wind , and they will re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind . he has no standing gra@@ in . the stal@@ k will yield no head . if it does yield , st@@ ran@@ gers will sw@@ allow it up .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the op@@ pression of the king of m@@ igh@@ ty ones .
they won '@@ t d@@ well in Yah@@ we@@ h 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will return to Egypt , and they will eat un@@ clean food in As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
what will you do in the day of so@@ lem@@ n assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yah@@ we@@ h ?
for , be@@ hold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . Mem@@ p@@ his will bur@@ y them . Net@@ t@@ les will poss@@ ess their pleas@@ ant things of silver . thor@@ ns will be in their ten@@ ts .
a pro@@ phe@@ t wat@@ ches over E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im with my God . a fo@@ w@@ ler 's sn@@ are is on all of his p@@ aths , and hos@@ tility in the house of his God .
they have deeply cor@@ rupted themselves , as in the days of Gi@@ be@@ ah . he will remember their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . he will punish them for their sin@@ s .
though they bring up their children , yet I will ber@@ e@@ ave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , wo@@ e also to them when I de@@ part from them !
" all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al ; for there I ha@@ ted them . because of the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their de@@ eds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their pr@@ inces are rebels .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is struck . their root has dri@@ ed up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the bel@@ ov@@ ed ones of their w@@ om@@ b . "
Israel is a lux@@ ur@@ i@@ ant v@@ ine that puts forth his fruit . according to the ab@@ und@@ ance of his fruit he has multi@@ p@@ lied his al@@ tar@@ s . as their land has prosp@@ ered , they have ad@@ or@@ ned their sac@@ red stones .
it also will be carried to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a for a present to a great king . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will receive sh@@ ame , and Israel will be as@@ ha@@ med of his own coun@@ sel .
when it is my desire , I will ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two trans@@ gres@@ sions .
you have p@@ low@@ ed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . you have re@@ ap@@ ed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . you have e@@ aten the fruit of lies , for you tr@@ usted in your way , in the multi@@ tude of your m@@ igh@@ ty men .
therefore a battle ro@@ ar will arise among your people , and all your for@@ t@@ resses will be destroyed , as S@@ hal@@ man destroyed Beth Ar@@ bel in the day of battle . the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces with her children .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yok@@ e on their nec@@ ks ; and I b@@ ent down to him and I f@@ ed him .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of my an@@ ger . I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of you ; and I will not come in wr@@ ath .
they will walk after Yah@@ we@@ h , who will ro@@ ar like a lion ; for he will ro@@ ar , and the children will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling from the west .
they will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" but I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you d@@ well in ten@@ ts , as in the days of the so@@ lem@@ n feast .
I have also spoken to the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and I have multi@@ p@@ lied visions ; and by the ministry of the pro@@ ph@@ ets I have used par@@ ables .
Jac@@ o@@ b fled into the country of Ara@@ m , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he ten@@ ded f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and like the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
according to their pas@@ ture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was ex@@ al@@ ted . therefore they have forgotten me .
I will meet them like a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her c@@ ub@@ s , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will dev@@ our them like a li@@ on@@ ess . the wild animal will tear them .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman will come on him . he is an un@@ wise son ; for when it is time , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come to the opening of the w@@ om@@ b .
Samar@@ ia will bear her guil@@ t ; for she has rebel@@ led against her God . they will fall by the s@@ word . their inf@@ ants will be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their pregn@@ ant women will be ri@@ pped open . "
As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a can '@@ t save us . we won '@@ t ride on hor@@ ses ; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ' Our go@@ ds ! ' for in you the fa@@ ther@@ less finds mer@@ cy . "
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , what have I to do any more with id@@ ols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green f@@ ir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is pru@@ dent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Yah@@ we@@ h are right , and the righ@@ te@@ ous walk in them ; But the rebel@@ li@@ ous st@@ um@@ ble in them .
what the s@@ warming loc@@ ust has left , the great loc@@ ust has e@@ aten . what the great loc@@ ust has left , the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per has e@@ aten . what the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per has left , the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lar has e@@ aten .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his te@@ eth are the te@@ eth of a lion , and he has the fan@@ gs of a li@@ on@@ ess .
he has laid my v@@ ine waste , and stri@@ pped my fi@@ g tree . he has stri@@ pped its bar@@ k , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
the v@@ ine has dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree with@@ ered ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all of the trees of the field are with@@ ered ; for joy has with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy a fast . call a so@@ lem@@ n assembly . gather the el@@ ders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , and cry to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h , I cry to you , For the fire has dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field p@@ ant to you , for the water bro@@ oks have dri@@ ed up , An@@ d the fire has dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
blow the tr@@ ump@@ et in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my hol@@ y mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tre@@ m@@ ble , for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h comes , for it is close at hand :

like the no@@ ise of char@@ i@@ ots on the tops of the mountains do they le@@ ap , like the no@@ ise of a fla@@ me of fire that dev@@ ours the st@@ ub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they run like m@@ igh@@ ty men . they clim@@ b the wall like war@@ ri@@ ors . they each march in his line , and they don '@@ t sw@@ er@@ ve off course .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they clim@@ b up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like th@@ i@@ ev@@ es .
Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ unders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obe@@ ys his command ; for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is great and very aw@@ es@@ ome , and who can en@@ dur@@ e it ?
tear your heart , and not your gar@@ ments , and turn to Yah@@ we@@ h , your God ; for he is gr@@ ac@@ ious and mer@@ ci@@ ful , slow to an@@ ger , and ab@@ und@@ ant in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , and re@@ len@@ ts from sending cal@@ am@@ ity .
gather the people . San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy the assembly . assem@@ ble the el@@ ders . gather the children , and those who nur@@ se from bre@@ asts . let the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om go forth from his room , and the bri@@ de out of her room .
Yah@@ we@@ h answ@@ ered his people , " be@@ hold , I will send you gra@@ in , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a re@@ pro@@ ach among the nations .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , you animals of the field ; for the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness spring up , for the tree be@@ ars its fruit . the fi@@ g tree and the v@@ ine yield their strength .
I will restore to you the years that the s@@ warming loc@@ ust has e@@ aten , the great loc@@ ust , the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per , and the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the mid@@ st of Israel , and that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen after@@ ward , that I will p@@ our out my Spiri@@ t on all f@@ les@@ h ; and your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters will pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y . your old men will dream dre@@ ams . your young men will see visions .
" for , be@@ hold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortun@@ es of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ,
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; and I will exec@@ ute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
" yes , and what are you to me , T@@ y@@ re , and S@@ id@@ on , and all the regions of Phil@@ isti@@ a ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swi@@ f@@ tly and spe@@ edil@@ y return your repayment on your own head .
and have sold the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hands of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they will sell them to the men of She@@ ba , to a far@@ away nation , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
" let the nations ar@@ o@@ use themselves , and come up to the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
Yah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and Th@@ under from Jer@@ usalem ; and the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th will shake ; but Yah@@ we@@ h will be a ref@@ uge to his people , and a stron@@ gh@@ old to the children of Israel .
it will happen in that day , that the mountains will drop down swe@@ et wine , the hil@@ ls will flow with milk , all the bro@@ oks of Ju@@ da@@ h will flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain will come forth from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
Egypt will be a de@@ so@@ lation , and E@@ dom will be a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , for the violence done to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
he said : " Yah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the pas@@ tures of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds will mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ mel will wi@@ ther . "
I will break the bar of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and cut off the inhabi@@ tant from the val@@ ley of Av@@ en , and him who holds the scep@@ ter from the house of E@@ den ; and the people of Syria shall go into cap@@ tivity to K@@ ir , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .

thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of T@@ y@@ re , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to E@@ dom , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember the bro@@ ther@@ ly C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;

thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have rejected Yah@@ we@@ h 's law , and have not kept his stat@@ utes , and their lies have led them as@@ tra@@ y , after which their fa@@ thers walked ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righ@@ te@@ ous for silver , and the ne@@ edy for a pair of sho@@ es ;

and they lay themselves down bes@@ ide every alt@@ ar on clo@@ th@@ es taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
yet I destroyed the Am@@ or@@ ite before them , whose he@@ ight was like the he@@ ight of the c@@ ed@@ ars , and he was strong as the o@@ aks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from ben@@ e@@ ath .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , to poss@@ ess the land of the Am@@ or@@ ite .
I raised up some of your sons for pro@@ ph@@ ets , and some of your young men for Naz@@ iri@@ tes . Is@@ n '@@ t this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
flight will per@@ ish from the swift ; and the strong won '@@ t strengthen his force ; neither shall the m@@ igh@@ ty deliver himself ;
neither shall he stand who hand@@ les the bo@@ w ; and he who is swift of fo@@ ot won '@@ t escape ; neither shall he who ri@@ des the hor@@ se deliver himself ;
hear this word that Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken against you , children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt , saying :
will a lion ro@@ ar in the th@@ ic@@ ket , when he has no pre@@ y ? does a young lion cry out of his den , if he has caught nothing ?
can a bird fall in a tra@@ p on the ear@@ th , where no sn@@ are is set for him ? does a sn@@ are spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
does the tr@@ ump@@ et alarm sound in a city , without the people being afraid ? does ev@@ il happen to a city , and Yah@@ we@@ h has@@ n '@@ t done it ?
procla@@ im in the pal@@ aces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the pal@@ aces in the land of Egypt , and say , " assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves on the mountains of Samar@@ ia , and see what unrest is in her , and what op@@ pression is among them . "
" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone stra@@ ight before her ; and you will cast yo@@ ur@@ selves into Har@@ mon , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" I struck you with b@@ light and mil@@ dew many times in your gar@@ den@@ s and your v@@ ine@@ yards ; and your fi@@ g trees and your olive trees have the s@@ warming loc@@ ust dev@@ oured : yet you ha@@ ven '@@ t returned to me , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" the vir@@ gin of Israel has fallen ; S@@ he shall rise no more . she is cast down on her land ; there is no one to raise her up . "
seek Yah@@ we@@ h , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it dev@@ our , and there be no one to qu@@ en@@ ch it in Be@@ the@@ l .
seek him who made the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades and Ori@@ on , and turns the shadow of death into the morning , and makes the day dark with night ; who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , Yah@@ we@@ h is his name ,
For@@ as@@ much therefore as you tr@@ amp@@ le on the poor , and take taxes from him of wheat : you have built houses of cut stone , but you will not d@@ well in them . you have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but you shall not drink their wine .
for I know how many your offen@@ ses , and how great are your s@@ ins@@ -- you who aff@@ lic@@ t the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the ne@@ edy in the courts .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the Lord : " w@@ ailing will be in all the broad ways ; and they will say in all the streets , ' A@@ las ! A@@ las ! ' and they will call the far@@ mer to mourning , and those who are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in lament@@ ation to w@@ ailing .
as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; O@@ r he went into the house and le@@ an@@ ed his hand on the wall , and a sn@@ ake bit him .
yes , though you offer me your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and me@@ al offer@@ ings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offer@@ ings of your f@@ at animals .
take away from me the no@@ ise of your songs ! I will not listen to the music of your har@@ ps .
Wo@@ e to those who are at ease in Z@@ ion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samar@@ ia , the no@@ table men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
go to Cal@@ ne@@ h , and see ; and from there go to Ham@@ ath the great ; then go down to G@@ ath of the Phil@@ ist@@ in@@ es@@ . are they better than these k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ? or is their border greater than your border ?
who lie on beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves on their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
who drink wine in bo@@ w@@ ls , and ano@@ int themselves with the best o@@ ils ; but they are not gri@@ ev@@ ed for the aff@@ li@@ ction of Joseph .
" for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ds , and the great house will be s@@ mas@@ hed to pieces , and the little house into bi@@ ts .
thus the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h showed me : and be@@ hold , he formed loc@@ ust@@ s in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and be@@ hold , it was the latter growth after the king 's har@@ v@@ est .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est of Be@@ the@@ l sent to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am king of Israel , saying , " Am@@ os has consp@@ ired against you in the mid@@ st of the house of Israel . the land is not able to bear all his words .
won '@@ t the land tre@@ m@@ ble for this , and everyone mour@@ n who d@@ wel@@ ls in it ? yes , it will rise up wh@@ ol@@ ly like the River ; and it will be s@@ tir@@ red up and s@@ ink again , like the River of Egypt .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day .
be@@ hold , the days come , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will send a fam@@ ine in the land , not a fam@@ ine of bread , nor a thir@@ st for water , but of hearing the words of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they will w@@ ander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will not find it .
though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and it will bi@@ te them .
though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enem@@ ies , there I will command the s@@ word , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for ev@@ il , and not for good .
for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , is he who tou@@ ches the land and it mel@@ ts , and all who d@@ well in it will mour@@ n ; and it will rise up wh@@ ol@@ ly like the River , and will s@@ ink again , like the River of Egypt .
it is he who buil@@ ds his rooms in the heav@@ ens , and has founded his va@@ ult on the ear@@ th ; he who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; Yah@@ we@@ h is his name .
are you not like the children of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians to me , children of Israel ? " says Yah@@ we@@ h . " ha@@ ven '@@ t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines from Cap@@ h@@ tor , and the Syri@@ ans from K@@ ir ?
be@@ hold , the eyes of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h are on the s@@ inf@@ ul k@@ ing@@ dom , and I will destroy it from off the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; except that I will not ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" for , be@@ hold , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all the nations , as gra@@ in is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet not the least ker@@ nel will fall on the ear@@ th .
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
I will bring my people Israel back from cap@@ tivity , and they will rebuild the ru@@ ined cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat their fruit .
I will plant them on their land , and they will no more be p@@ lu@@ cked up out of their land which I have given them , " says Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
the pride of your heart has dec@@ e@@ ived you , you who d@@ well in the cle@@ fts of the rock , whose habi@@ tation is high , who says in his heart , ' Wh@@ o will bring me down to the ground ? '
though you mount on high as the e@@ ag@@ le , and though your n@@ est is set among the stars , I will bring you down from there , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but don '@@ t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction . D@@ on '@@ t speak pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .

for as you have dr@@ un@@ k on my hol@@ y mountain , so will all the nations drink continu@@ ally . yes , they will drink , sw@@ allow down , and will be as though they had not been .
the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will be a fire , the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble . they will bur@@ n among them , and dev@@ our them . there will not be any remaining to the house of E@@ sa@@ u . " indeed , Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
but Yah@@ we@@ h sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a m@@ igh@@ ty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my .
nevertheless the men ro@@ wed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not , for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my against them .
for you threw me into the dep@@ ths , in the heart of the seas . the flood was all around me . all your waves and your bil@@ lows passed over me .
the people of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h believed God ; and they proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , from their greatest even to their least .
the news reached the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and took off his royal ro@@ be , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , both man and animal , and let them cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
God saw their works , that they turned from their ev@@ il way . God re@@ len@@ ted of the disaster which he said he would do to them , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do it .
therefore now , Yah@@ we@@ h , take , I be@@ g you , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . "
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the sha@@ de , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h God prepared a v@@ ine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a sha@@ de over his head , to deliver him from his dis@@ comfor@@ t . so Jon@@ ah was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad because of the v@@ ine .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ ash@@ ti@@ te in the days of Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which he saw concerning Samar@@ ia and Jer@@ usalem .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O ear@@ th , and all that is there@@ in : and let the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h be witness against you , the Lord from his hol@@ y temp@@ le .
for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h comes forth out of his place , and will come down and tre@@ ad on the high places of the ear@@ th .
" all this is for the dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence of Jac@@ o@@ b , and for the sin@@ s of the house of Israel . what is the dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence of Jac@@ o@@ b ? Is@@ n '@@ t it Samar@@ ia ? and what are the high places of Ju@@ da@@ h ? A@@ ren '@@ t they Jer@@ usalem ?
all her id@@ ols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temp@@ le gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute has she gathered them , and to the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute shall they return . "
D@@ on '@@ t tell it in G@@ ath . D@@ on '@@ t we@@ ep at all . at Beth O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h I have rol@@ led myself in the d@@ ust .
har@@ ness the char@@ i@@ ot to the swift ste@@ ed , inhabi@@ tant of L@@ ach@@ ish . she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Z@@ ion ; For the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel were found in you .
s@@ have your heads , and cut off your ha@@ ir for the children of your de@@ light . en@@ large your bal@@ d@@ ness like the vul@@ ture ; for they have gone into cap@@ tivity from you !
Wo@@ e to those who dev@@ ise in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and work ev@@ il on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and se@@ ize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
you drive the women of my people out from their pleas@@ ant houses ; from their young children you take away my b@@ les@@ sing fore@@ ver .
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yah@@ we@@ h at their head .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them , and break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their de@@ eds ev@@ il . "
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets who lead my people as@@ tra@@ y ; for those who fe@@ ed their te@@ eth , they procla@@ im , " Peace ! " and who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for their m@@ ou@@ ths , they prepare war against him :
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not div@@ ine ; and the sun will go down on the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day will be black over them .
the se@@ ers shall be disappointed , and the di@@ vin@@ ers con@@ founded . yes , they shall all cover their li@@ ps ; for there is no answer from God . "
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jac@@ o@@ b his dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and to Israel his sin .
ple@@ ase listen to this , you heads of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and rul@@ ers of the house of Israel , who ab@@ h@@ or justice , and per@@ ver@@ t all equ@@ ity .
therefore Z@@ ion for your sake will be p@@ low@@ ed like a field , and Jer@@ usalem will become he@@ aps of rub@@ ble , and the mountain of the temp@@ le like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and peoples will stream to it .
and he will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations af@@ ar off . they will beat their s@@ words into p@@ low@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks . nation will not lift up s@@ word against nation , neither will they learn war any more .
but they will sit every man under his v@@ ine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has spoken .
indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their go@@ ds ; but we will walk in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h our God fore@@ ver and ever .
" in that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I will assem@@ ble that which is la@@ me , and I will gather that which is driven away , and that which I have aff@@ lic@@ ted ;
and I will make that which was la@@ me a re@@ mn@@ ant , and that which was cast far off a strong nation : and Yah@@ we@@ h will reign over them on Mount Z@@ ion from then on , even fore@@ ver . "
you , to@@ wer of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Z@@ ion , to you it will come , yes , the former domin@@ ion will come , the k@@ ing@@ dom of the daughter of Jer@@ usalem .
now you shall gather yo@@ ur@@ self in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a ro@@ d on the che@@ ek .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in la@@ bor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d in the strength of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the ear@@ th .
he will be our peace when As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches through our for@@ t@@ resses , then we will raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in its gates . he will deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches within our border .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Jac@@ o@@ b will be in the mid@@ st of many peoples , like dew from Yah@@ we@@ h , like sho@@ wers on the gr@@ ass , that don '@@ t wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
" it will happen in that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " That I will cut off your hor@@ ses out of the mid@@ st of you , and will destroy your char@@ i@@ ots .
I will cut off your en@@ gra@@ ved images and your pil@@ lars out of your mid@@ st ; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands .
listen now to what Yah@@ we@@ h says : " arise , p@@ lead your case before the mountains , and let the hil@@ ls hear what you have to say .
hear , you mountains , Yah@@ we@@ h 's controversy , and you en@@ during foundations of the ear@@ th ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a controversy with his people , and he will conten@@ d with Israel .
therefore I also have struck you with a gri@@ ev@@ ous wo@@ und . I have made you de@@ so@@ late because of your sin@@ s .
you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your hum@@ iliation will be in your mid@@ st . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the s@@ word .
you will so@@ w , but won '@@ t re@@ ap . you will tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but won '@@ t ano@@ int yo@@ ur@@ self with oil ; and cr@@ ush grap@@ es , but won '@@ t drink the wine .
the go@@ dly man has per@@ ished out of the ear@@ th , and there is no one u@@ pri@@ ght among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hun@@ ts his brother with a net .
the best of them is like a bri@@ er . the most u@@ pri@@ ght is worse than a Th@@ or@@ n h@@ edge . the day of your watch@@ men , even your vis@@ itation , has come ; now is the time of their conf@@ usion .
D@@ on '@@ t trust in a neigh@@ bor . D@@ on '@@ t put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your em@@ br@@ ace , be careful of the words of your m@@ outh !
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
but as for me , I will look to Yah@@ we@@ h . I will wait for the God of my sal@@ vation . my God will hear me .
D@@ on '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice against me , my enemy . when I fall , I will arise . when I sit in d@@ ark@@ ness , Yah@@ we@@ h will be a light to me .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of Yah@@ we@@ h , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ leads my case , and execu@@ tes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
in that day they will come to you from As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and mountain to mountain .
" as in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt , I will show them mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous things . "
the nations will see and be as@@ ha@@ med of all their might . they will lay their hand on their m@@ outh . their e@@ ars will be de@@ af .
they will lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent . like cra@@ w@@ ling things of the ear@@ th they shall come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling out of their den@@ s . they will come with fear to Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and will be afraid because of you .
he will again have comp@@ as@@ sion on us . he will tre@@ ad our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities under fo@@ ot ; and you will cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
Yah@@ we@@ h is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty un@@ punished . Yah@@ we@@ h has his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
he re@@ bu@@ kes the sea , and makes it d@@ ry , and dri@@ es up all the rivers . B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ hes , and Car@@ mel ; and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ hes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hil@@ ls mel@@ t away . the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who d@@ well in it .
who can stand before his in@@ dign@@ ation ? who can en@@ dur@@ e the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger ? his wr@@ ath is p@@ oured out like fire , and the ro@@ cks are broken apart by him .
but with an over@@ flow@@ ing flood , he will make a full end of her place , and will pursue his enem@@ ies into d@@ ark@@ ness .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have aff@@ lic@@ ted you , I will aff@@ lic@@ t you no more .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red . the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let . the char@@ i@@ ots f@@ lash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the p@@ ine spe@@ ars are br@@ and@@ ished .
it is decre@@ ed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her hand@@ ma@@ ids mo@@ an as with the voice of d@@ ov@@ es , beating on their bre@@ asts .
take the sp@@ oil of silver . take the sp@@ oil of gold , for there is no end of the store , the gl@@ ory of all good@@ ly furniture .
where is the den of the li@@ ons , and the fe@@ eding place of the young li@@ ons , where the lion and the li@@ on@@ ess walked , the lion 's c@@ ub@@ s , and no one made them afraid ?
the lion t@@ ore in pieces enough for his c@@ ub@@ s , and st@@ ran@@ g@@ led for his li@@ on@@ esses , and filled his c@@ aves with the kill , and his den@@ s with pre@@ y .
the Hor@@ sem@@ an mounting , and the fl@@ ashing s@@ word , the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar , and a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great he@@ ap of cor@@ p@@ ses , and there is no end of the bodies . they st@@ um@@ ble on their bodies ,
" be@@ hold , I am against you , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " and I will lift your sk@@ ir@@ ts over your face . I will show the nations your nak@@ edn@@ ess , and the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms your sh@@ ame .
it will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you , and say , ' N@@ inev@@ e@@ h is laid waste ! who will mour@@ n for her ? ' where will I seek comfor@@ ters for you ? "
are you better than No @@@ -@@ @ Am@@ on , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose ram@@ part was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
yet was she carried away . she went into cap@@ tivity . her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her hon@@ or@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in cha@@ ins .
all your for@@ t@@ resses will be like fi@@ g trees with the first @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ pe fig@@ s : if they are shaken , they fall into the m@@ outh of the e@@ ater .
your guards are like the loc@@ ust@@ s , and your officials like the s@@ war@@ ms of loc@@ ust@@ s , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun appears , they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
there is no he@@ aling your wo@@ und , for your injur@@ y is fatal . all who hear the report of you cla@@ p their hands over you ; for who has@@ n '@@ t felt your end@@ less cru@@ el@@ ty ?
" look among the nations , watch , and wonder mar@@ v@@ el@@ ously ; for I am working a work in your days , which you will not believe though it is told you .
for , be@@ hold , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , that march through the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , to poss@@ ess d@@ wel@@ ling places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves . their hor@@ se@@ men press pro@@ u@@ dly on . yes , their hor@@ se@@ men come from af@@ ar . they fly as an e@@ ag@@ le that hur@@ ries to dev@@ our .
yes , he sco@@ ffs at kings , and pr@@ inces are a der@@ ision to him . he la@@ ug@@ h@@ s at every stron@@ gh@@ old , for he buil@@ ds up an ear@@ then ram@@ p , and takes it .
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the cre@@ eping things , that have no ru@@ ler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the ho@@ ok . he cat@@ ches them in his net , and ga@@ thers them in his dra@@ g@@ net . therefore he re@@ jo@@ ices and is glad .

I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ram@@ parts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hur@@ ries toward the end , and won '@@ t prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come . it won '@@ t delay .
yes , moreover , wine is t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous . a ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t stay at home , who en@@ lar@@ ges his desire as She@@ ol , and he is like death , and can '@@ t be satisfied , but ga@@ thers to himself all nations , and he@@ aps to himself all peoples .
because you have pl@@ under@@ ed many nations , all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the peoples will pl@@ under you , because of men 's blood , and for the violence done to the land , to the city and to all who d@@ well in it .
Wo@@ e to him who gets an ev@@ il gain for his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of ev@@ il !
for the stone will cry out of the wall , and the be@@ am out of the wo@@ od@@ work will answer it .

I will swe@@ ep away man and animal . I will swe@@ ep away the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and the he@@ aps of rub@@ ble with the w@@ ic@@ ked . I will cut off man from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is at hand . for Yah@@ we@@ h has prepared a sacrifice . he has consec@@ rated his guests .
their wealth will become a sp@@ oil , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation . yes , they will build houses , but won '@@ t in@@ ha@@ bit them . they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but won '@@ t drink their wine .
seek Yah@@ we@@ h , all you hum@@ ble of the land , who have kept his ord@@ inan@@ ces . seek righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . seek hum@@ il@@ ity . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger .

she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive correc@@ tion . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t trust in Yah@@ we@@ h . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw near to her God .
in that day you will not be disappointed for all your do@@ ings , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me ; for then I will take away out of the mid@@ st of you your pro@@ u@@ dly ex@@ ulting ones , and you will no more be ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty in my hol@@ y mountain .

the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel will not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies , neither will a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh , for they will fe@@ ed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
Yah@@ we@@ h has taken away your judg@@ ments . he has thrown out your enemy . the King of Israel , Yah@@ we@@ h , is in the mid@@ st of you . you will not be afraid of ev@@ il any more .
in that day , it will be said to Jer@@ usalem , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ion . D@@ on '@@ t let your hands be weak . "
Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , is in the mid@@ st of you , a m@@ igh@@ ty one who will save . he will re@@ jo@@ ice over you with joy . he will calm you in his love . he will re@@ jo@@ ice over you with singing .
in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came by Hag@@ ga@@ i , the pro@@ phe@@ t , to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , saying ,
I called for a drought on the land , on the mountains , on the gra@@ in , on the new wine , on the oil , on that which the ground brings forth , on men , on li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and on all the la@@ bor of the hands . "
then Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , with all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , their God , and the words of Hag@@ ga@@ i , the pro@@ phe@@ t , as Yah@@ we@@ h , their God , had sent him ; and the people fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h .
in the seventh month , in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ first day of the month , the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
" speak now to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , and to the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , saying ,
this is the word that I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spiri@@ t lived among you . ' D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . '
for this is what Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies says : ' yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heav@@ ens , the ear@@ th , the sea , and the d@@ ry land ;

'@@ Con@@ si@@ der , ple@@ ase , from this day and back@@ ward , from the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the ninth month , since the day that the foundation of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le was laid , consider it .
the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came the second time to Hag@@ ga@@ i in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the month , saying ,
I will overthrow the th@@ r@@ one of k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms . I will destroy the strength of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the nations . I will overthrow the char@@ i@@ ots , and those who ride in them . the hor@@ ses and their ri@@ ders will come down , everyone by the s@@ word of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do , the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
therefore tell them : thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : ' return to me , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
on the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the ele@@ venth month , which is the month She@@ bat , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do , the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
" I had a vision in the night , and be@@ hold , a man ri@@ ding on a red hor@@ se , and he stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees that were in a rav@@ ine ; and behind him there were red , bro@@ wn , and white hor@@ ses .
they reported to the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h who stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , " We have walked back and forth through the ear@@ th , and be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th is at rest and in peace . "
for I , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' will be to her a wall of fire around it , and I will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
many nations shall join themselves to Yah@@ we@@ h in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of you , and you shall know that Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has sent me to you .
he answ@@ ered and spoke to those who stood before him , saying , " T@@ ake the fil@@ thy gar@@ ments off of him . " to him he said , " be@@ hold , I have caused your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to pass from you , and I will clo@@ the you with rich clo@@ thing . "
I said , " Let them set a clean tur@@ ban on his head . " so they set a clean tur@@ ban on his head , and clo@@ th@@ ed him ; and the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h was standing by .
hear now , Jos@@ hua the high pri@@ est , you and your fel@@ lows who sit before you ; for they are men who are a sign : for , be@@ hold , I will bring forth my ser@@ vant , the Bran@@ ch .
the an@@ gel who talked with me came again , and w@@ ak@@ ened me , as a man who is w@@ ak@@ ened out of his sle@@ ep .
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are bes@@ ide the two golden sp@@ outs , that p@@ our the golden oil out of themselves ? "
( and be@@ hold , a tal@@ ent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket . "
then lifted I up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there were two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings . now they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k , and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket between ear@@ th and the sky .
again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , four char@@ i@@ ots came out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of br@@ ass .
the one with the black hor@@ ses goes out toward the north country ; and the white went out after them ; and the d@@ app@@ led went forth toward the south country . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the ear@@ th : and he said , " G@@ o around and through the ear@@ th ! " so they walked back and forth through the ear@@ th .
then he called to me , and spoke to me , saying , " be@@ hold , those who go toward the north country have qu@@ i@@ eted my spirit in the north country . "
" take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , where they have come from Bab@@ yl@@ on .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crow@@ ns , and set them on the head of Jos@@ hua the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est ;
and speak to him , saying , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " be@@ hold , the man whose name is the Bran@@ ch : and he shall grow up out of his place ; and he shall build Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le ;

it happened in the fourth year of king Dar@@ i@@ us that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah in the fourth day of the ninth month , the month of Ch@@ is@@ lev .
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the pri@@ ests , saying , ' When you fas@@ ted and mour@@ ned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these sev@@ enty years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
when you eat , and when you drink , don '@@ t you eat for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and drink for yo@@ ur@@ selves ?
D@@ on '@@ t op@@ press the wi@@ dow , nor the fa@@ ther@@ less , the foreig@@ ner , nor the poor ; and let none of you dev@@ ise ev@@ il against his brother in your heart . '
it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " I have returned to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem . Jer@@ usalem shall be called ' The City of Tru@@ th ; ' and the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' The Holy Mountain . ' "
for before those days there was no wages for man , nor any wages for an animal ; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in , because of the ad@@ versary . for I set all men everyone against his neigh@@ bor .
" for the se@@ ed of peace and the v@@ ine will yield its fruit , and the ground will give its increase , and the heav@@ ens will give their dew ; and I will cause the re@@ mn@@ ant of this people to inher@@ it all these things .
it shall come to pass that , as you were a cur@@ se among the nations , house of Ju@@ da@@ h and house of Israel , so will I save you , and you shall be a b@@ les@@ sing . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . let your hands be strong . "
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : " as I thought to do ev@@ il to you , when your fa@@ thers provoked me to wr@@ ath , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent ;
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neigh@@ bor . exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
an or@@ acle . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h is against the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and will rest upon Dam@@ as@@ cus ; for the eye of man and of all the tri@@ bes of Israel is toward Yah@@ we@@ h ;
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will wri@@ the in ag@@ ony ; as will E@@ kr@@ on , for her expec@@ tation will be disappointed ; and the king will per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will not be inhabited .
I will en@@ camp around my house against the army , that none pass through or return ; and no op@@ pres@@ sor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .
for indeed I b@@ end Ju@@ da@@ h as a bo@@ w for me . I have filled the bo@@ w with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and I will stir up your sons , Z@@ ion , against your sons , Greece , and will make you like the s@@ word of a m@@ igh@@ ty man .
Yah@@ we@@ h will be seen over them ; and his ar@@ row will go f@@ lash like ligh@@ t@@ ning ; and the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and will go with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
Yah@@ we@@ h their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the je@@ wel@@ s of a cro@@ wn , lifted on high over his land .
for how great is his Go@@ od@@ ness , and how great is his beauty ! gra@@ in will make the young men flo@@ ur@@ ish , and new wine the vir@@ g@@ ins .
from him will come forth the cor@@ ner@@ stone , from him the na@@ il , from him the battle bo@@ w , from him every ru@@ ler together .
they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , t@@ reading down mu@@ d@@ dy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yah@@ we@@ h is with them ; and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses will be con@@ founded .
" I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back ; for I have mer@@ cy on them ; and they will be as though I had not cast them off : for I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and I will hear them .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will be like a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and their heart will re@@ jo@@ ice as through wine ; yes , their children will see it , and re@@ jo@@ ice . their heart will be glad in Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .
he will pass through the sea of aff@@ li@@ ction , and will strike the waves in the sea , and all the dep@@ ths of the N@@ ile will d@@ ry up ; and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a will be brought down , and the scep@@ ter of Egypt will de@@ part .
for I will no more p@@ ity the inhabitants of the land , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " but , be@@ hold , I will deliver the men everyone into his neigh@@ bor 's hand , and into the hand of his king . they will strike the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them . "
then I said , " I will not fe@@ ed you . that which dies , let it die ; and that which is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let those who are left eat each other 's f@@ les@@ h . "
it was broken in that day ; and thus the poor of the flock that list@@ ened to me knew that it was the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
I said to them , " If you think it best , give me my wages ; and if not , keep them . " so they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " throw it to the P@@ ot@@ ter , the hand@@ some price that I was valued at by them ! " I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the P@@ ot@@ ter , in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
Wo@@ e to the wor@@ th@@ less she@@ ph@@ er@@ d who leaves the flock ! the s@@ word will be on his arm , and on his right eye . his arm will be completely with@@ ered , and his right eye will be totally b@@ lin@@ ded ! "
an or@@ acle . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h , who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens , and lays the foundation of the ear@@ th , and forms the spirit of man within him says :
" be@@ hold , I will make Jer@@ usalem a c@@ up of re@@ el@@ ing to all the surrounding peoples , and on Ju@@ da@@ h also will it be in the siege against Jer@@ usalem .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jer@@ usalem a bur@@ den@@ some stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the ear@@ th will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I will strike every hor@@ se with terror , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will strike every hor@@ se of the peoples with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
in that day Yah@@ we@@ h will defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem . he who is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jer@@ usalem .
it will come to pass in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they will be remember@@ ed no more . I will also cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the spirit of imp@@ urity to pass out of the land .
it will happen in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets will each be as@@ ha@@ med of his vision , when he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies ; neither will they wear a ha@@ iry man@@ tle to dec@@ e@@ ive :
but he will say , ' I am no pro@@ phe@@ t , I am a til@@ ler of the ground ; for I have been made a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant from my youth . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
it will be a unique day which is known to Yah@@ we@@ h ; not day , and not night ; but it will come to pass , that at evening time there will be light .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
this will be the pla@@ gue with which Yah@@ we@@ h will strike all the peoples who have war@@ red against Jer@@ usalem : their f@@ les@@ h will consum@@ e away while they stand on their feet , and their eyes will consum@@ e away in their so@@ c@@ kets , and their ton@@ gue will consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neigh@@ bor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neigh@@ bor .
Ju@@ da@@ h also will fight at Jer@@ usalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clo@@ thing , in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
so will be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the don@@ key , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that pla@@ gue .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jer@@ usalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , and to keep the feast of ten@@ ts .
it will be , that who@@ ever of all the families of the ear@@ th do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go up to Jer@@ usalem to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don '@@ t go up to keep the feast of ten@@ ts .
" but you prof@@ ane it , in that you say , ' Yah@@ we@@ h 's table is pollu@@ ted , and its fruit , even its food , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble . '
be@@ hold , I will re@@ bu@@ ke your se@@ ed , and will spread D@@ ung on your faces , even the D@@ ung of your fe@@ asts ; and you will be taken away with it .
" my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be rever@@ ent toward me ; and he was rever@@ ent toward me , and stood in a@@ we of my name .
Ju@@ da@@ h has dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and an ab@@ omin@@ ation is committed in Israel and in Jer@@ usalem ; for Ju@@ da@@ h has prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of Yah@@ we@@ h which he lov@@ es , and has married the daughter of a foreign go@@ d .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cut off , to the man who does this , him who w@@ akes and him who answers , out of the ten@@ ts of Jac@@ o@@ b , and him who offers an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
yet you say , ' Wh@@ y ? ' because Yah@@ we@@ h has been witness between you and the wife of your youth , against whom you have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , though she is your compan@@ ion , and the wife of your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
" be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he will prepare the way before me ; and the Lord , whom you seek , will su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to his temp@@ le ; and the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom you desire , be@@ hold , he comes ! " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
and he will sit as a refin@@ er and pur@@ i@@ fi@@ er of silver , and he will pur@@ ify the sons of L@@ evi , and ref@@ ine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yah@@ we@@ h offer@@ ings in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
then those who fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h spoke one with another ; and Yah@@ we@@ h list@@ ened , and heard , and a book of memory was written before him , for those who fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h , and who hon@@ ored his name .
he will turn the hear@@ ts of the fa@@ thers to the children , and the hear@@ ts of the children to their fa@@ thers , lest I come and strike the ear@@ th with a cur@@ se . "
J@@ es@@ se became the father of King David . David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of U@@ ri@@ ah .
now the birth of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregn@@ ant by the Holy Spiri@@ t .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name J@@ es@@ us , for it is he who shall save his people from their sin@@ s . "
" be@@ hold , the vir@@ gin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . they shall call his name Im@@ man@@ uel " ; which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
Joseph ar@@ ose from his sle@@ ep , and did as the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded him , and took his wife to himself ;
'@@ You B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , land of Ju@@ da@@ h , are in no way least among the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d my people , Israel . ' "
he sent them to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said , " G@@ o and search dil@@ ig@@ ently for the young child . when you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and be@@ hold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and wor@@ shi@@ ped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus was re@@ ig@@ ning over Ju@@ de@@ a in the place of his father , Her@@ od , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Gal@@ il@@ ee ,
" even now the ax@@ e lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
his win@@ no@@ wing for@@ k is in his hand , and he will thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly cleans@@ e his th@@ res@@ hing floor . he will gather his wheat into the bar@@ n , but the c@@ haf@@ f he will bur@@ n up with un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire . "
J@@ es@@ us , when he was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , went up directly from the water : and be@@ hold , the heav@@ ens were opened to him . he saw the Spiri@@ t of God des@@ cen@@ ding as a do@@ ve , and coming on him .
the people who sat in d@@ ark@@ ness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has da@@ w@@ ned . "
walk@@ ing by the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and An@@ drew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fisher@@ men .
going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , in the boat with Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e their father , men@@ ding their n@@ ets . he called them .
the report about him went out into all Syria . they brought to him all who were si@@ ck , aff@@ lic@@ ted with various diseases and tor@@ ments , poss@@ essed with dem@@ ons , ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tics , and paral@@ y@@ tics ; and he he@@ aled them .
seeing the multi@@ tu@@ des , he went up onto the mountain . when he had sat down , his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him .
" you are the salt of the ear@@ th , but if the salt has lost its f@@ lav@@ or , with what will it be sal@@ ted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and tro@@ dden under the feet of men .
neither do you light a lam@@ p , and put it under a measuring bas@@ ket , but on a stand ; and it sh@@ ines to all who are in the house .
for most certainly , I tell you , until heav@@ en and ear@@ th pass away , not even one smal@@ lest letter or one tiny p@@ en stro@@ ke shall in any way pass away from the law , until all things are accomplished .
for I tell you that unless your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness exceeds that of the s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' W@@ ho@@ ever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your ad@@ versary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
if your right eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , p@@ lu@@ ck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should per@@ ish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
if your right hand causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should per@@ ish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
but let your ' Y@@ es ' be ' Y@@ es ' and your ' No ' be ' No . ' whatever is more than these is of the ev@@ il one .
" you have heard that it was said , ' A@@ n eye for an eye , and a to@@ o@@ th for a to@@ o@@ th . '
but I tell you , love your enem@@ ies , b@@ less those who cur@@ se you , do good to those who h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for those who mist@@ re@@ at you and persec@@ ute you ,
" be careful that you don '@@ t do your char@@ itable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but you , when you pra@@ y , enter into your in@@ ner room , and having shut your door , pra@@ y to your F@@ ather who is in secret , and your F@@ ather who sees in secret will reward you openly .
" moreover when you fast , don '@@ t be like the hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , with sad faces . for they dis@@ figure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fas@@ ting . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
so that you are not seen by men to be fas@@ ting , but by your F@@ ather who is in secret , and your F@@ ather , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" the lam@@ p of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
but if your eye is ev@@ il , your whole body will be full of d@@ ark@@ ness . if therefore the light that is in you is d@@ ark@@ ness , how great is the d@@ ark@@ ness !
but if God so clo@@ th@@ es the gr@@ ass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the ov@@ en , won '@@ t he much more clo@@ the you , you of little faith ?
" therefore don '@@ t be anx@@ ious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clo@@ th@@ ed ? '
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be jud@@ ged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be meas@@ ured to you .
why do you see the spec@@ k that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?

" D@@ on '@@ t give that which is hol@@ y to the do@@ gs , neither throw your pe@@ ar@@ ls before the p@@ ig@@ s , lest perhaps they tr@@ amp@@ le them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
if you then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en give good things to those who ask him !
" enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
" everyone therefore who he@@ ars these words of mine , and does them , I will lik@@ en him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat on that house ; and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fall , for it was founded on the rock .
everyone who he@@ ars these words of mine , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do them will be like a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , who built his house on the s@@ and .
he said to them , " Wh@@ y are you fear@@ ful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , re@@ bu@@ ked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Ger@@ ges@@ en@@ es , two people poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons met him there , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exce@@ ed@@ ingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
those who f@@ ed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were poss@@ essed with dem@@ ons .
be@@ hold , they brought to him a man who was paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , lying on a bed . J@@ es@@ us , seeing their faith , said to the paral@@ y@@ tic , " Son , che@@ er up ! your sin@@ s are for@@ given you . "
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on ear@@ th to for@@ give sin@@ s ... " ( then he said to the paral@@ y@@ tic ) , " G@@ et up , and take up your M@@ at , and go up to your house . "
when J@@ es@@ us heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physi@@ cian , but those who are si@@ ck do .
J@@ es@@ us said to them , " Can the friends of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om mour@@ n , as long as the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om is with them ? but the days will come when the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
J@@ es@@ us went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their syn@@ ago@@ gues , and pre@@ aching the Go@@ od News of the Kingdom , and he@@ aling every disease and every si@@ ck@@ ness among the people .
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion for them , because they were har@@ ass@@ ed and sc@@ at@@ tered , like she@@ ep without a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive you , nor hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake off the d@@ ust from your feet .
but be@@ w@@ are of men : for they will deliver you up to coun@@ cils , and in their syn@@ ago@@ gues they will s@@ cour@@ ge you .
but when they deliver you up , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be like his teacher , and the ser@@ vant like his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bul , how much more those of his household !
what I tell you in the d@@ ark@@ ness , speak in the light ; and what you hear wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in the e@@ ar , procla@@ im on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the sou@@ l . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both sou@@ l and body in Ge@@ hen@@ na .
" D@@ on '@@ t think that I came to send peace on the ear@@ th . I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come to send peace , but a s@@ word .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
who@@ ever gives one of these little ones just a c@@ up of cold water to drink in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news pre@@ ached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not ar@@ isen anyone greater than John the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ zer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is greater than he .
you , Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , who are ex@@ al@@ ted to heav@@ en , you will go down to H@@ ades . for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works had been done in So@@ dom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .

all things have been delivered to me by my F@@ ather . no one knows the Son , except the F@@ ather ; neither does anyone know the F@@ ather , except the Son , and he to whom the Son desi@@ res to reveal him .
take my yok@@ e upon you , and learn from me , for I am g@@ ent@@ le and low@@ ly in heart ; and you will find rest for your so@@ ul@@ s .
at that time , J@@ es@@ us went on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day through the gra@@ in fields . his dis@@ cip@@ les were hun@@ gry and began to p@@ lu@@ ck heads of gra@@ in and to eat .
but the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , when they saw it , said to him , " be@@ hold , your dis@@ cip@@ les do what is not law@@ ful to do on the Sab@@ b@@ ath . "
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
he said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one she@@ ep , and if this one falls into a p@@ it on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , won '@@ t he gra@@ b on to it , and lift it out ?
then one poss@@ essed by a dem@@ on , b@@ lin@@ d and m@@ ute , was brought to him and he he@@ aled him , so that the b@@ lin@@ d and m@@ ute man both spoke and saw .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and pl@@ under his goods , unless he first bin@@ d the strong man ? then he will pl@@ under his house .
who@@ ever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be for@@ given him ; but who@@ ever speaks against the Holy Spiri@@ t , it will not be for@@ given him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
you off@@ spring of vi@@ pers , how can you , being ev@@ il , speak good things ? for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart , the m@@ outh speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the ev@@ il man out of his ev@@ il treasure brings out ev@@ il things .
but the un@@ clean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through water@@ less places , seeking rest , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swe@@ pt , and put in order .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spir@@ its more ev@@ il than he is , and they enter in and d@@ well there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this ev@@ il generation . "
others fell on ro@@ cky ground , where they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have much soil , and immediately they sp@@ ran@@ g up , because they had no dep@@ th of ear@@ th .
for who@@ ever has , to him will be given , and he will have ab@@ und@@ ance , but who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have , from him will be taken away even that which he has .
in them the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perce@@ ive :
for this people 's heart has grown cal@@ l@@ ous , their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , they have closed their eyes ; or else perhaps they might perce@@ ive with their eyes , hear with their e@@ ars , understand with their heart , and should turn again ; and I would he@@ al them . '
for most certainly I tell you that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men desi@@ red to see the things which you see , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear them .
when anyone he@@ ars the word of the Kingdom , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t understand it , the ev@@ il one comes , and sn@@ at@@ ches away that which has been so@@ wn in his heart . this is what was so@@ wn by the road@@ side .
what was so@@ wn among the thor@@ ns , this is he who he@@ ars the word , but the car@@ es of this age and the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ ches ch@@ oke the word , and he becomes un@@ fruit@@ ful .
what was so@@ wn on the good ground , this is he who he@@ ars the word , and understands it , who most certainly be@@ ars fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times as much , some six@@ ty , and some thirty . "
let both grow together until the har@@ v@@ est , and in the har@@ v@@ est time I will tell the re@@ apers , " First , gather up the dar@@ nel we@@ eds , and bin@@ d them in bun@@ d@@ les to bur@@ n them ; but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n . " ' "
which indeed is smaller than all se@@ eds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the her@@ bs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lo@@ dge in its branches . "
then J@@ es@@ us sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , and went into the house . his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him , saying , " explain to us the par@@ able of the dar@@ nel we@@ eds of the field . "
the field is the world ; and the good se@@ ed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the dar@@ nel we@@ eds are the children of the ev@@ il one .
as therefore the dar@@ nel we@@ eds are gathered up and burned with fire ; so will it be at the end of this age .
then the righ@@ te@@ ous will sh@@ ine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their F@@ ather . he who has e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hi@@ d . in his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and bu@@ ys that field .
" again , the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a dra@@ g@@ net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into contain@@ ers , but the bad they threw away .
for Her@@ od had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Her@@ odi@@ as , his brother Philip 's wife .
the king was gri@@ ev@@ ed , but for the sake of his o@@ aths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he comman@@ ded it to be given ,
when evening had come , his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him , saying , " This place is de@@ ser@@ ted , and the hour is already late . send the multi@@ tu@@ des away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tu@@ des to sit down on the gr@@ ass ; and he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed , broke and gave the lo@@ aves to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les gave to the multi@@ tu@@ des .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve bas@@ kets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
after he had sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pra@@ y . when evening had come , he was there alone .
when the people of that place recogn@@ ized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were si@@ ck ,
and they beg@@ ged him that they might just touch the f@@ rin@@ ge of his gar@@ ment . as many as touched it were made whole .
for God comman@@ ded , ' hon@@ or your father and your mother , ' and , ' He who speaks ev@@ il of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
you hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! well did I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y of you , saying ,
that which enters into the m@@ outh do@@ es@@ n '@@ t def@@ ile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the m@@ outh , this def@@ il@@ es the man . "
J@@ es@@ us depar@@ ted there , and came near to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
and he took the seven lo@@ aves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tu@@ des .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven bas@@ kets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
in the morning , ' It will be f@@ oul weather today , for the sky is red and threatening . ' hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! you know how to dis@@ cer@@ n the appearance of the sky , but you can '@@ t dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times !
an ev@@ il and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jon@@ ah . " he left them , and depar@@ ted .
then they understood that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell them to be@@ w@@ are of the ye@@ ast of bread , but of the teaching of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es .
now when J@@ es@@ us came into the parts of Ca@@ es@@ area Philip@@ pi , he asked his dis@@ cip@@ les , saying , " Wh@@ o do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
I will give to you the ke@@ ys of the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en , and whatever you bin@@ d on ear@@ th will have been bound in heav@@ en ; and whatever you release on ear@@ th will have been released in heav@@ en . "
from that time , J@@ es@@ us began to show his dis@@ cip@@ les that he must go to Jer@@ usalem and suffer many things from the el@@ ders , chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
but he turned , and said to Peter , " G@@ et behind me , S@@ atan ! you are a stumbling block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of men . "
for the Son of Man will come in the gl@@ ory of his F@@ ather with his an@@ gel@@ s , and then he will ren@@ der to everyone according to his de@@ eds .
while he was still speaking , be@@ hold , a bright cl@@ oud over@@ shad@@ owed them . be@@ hold , a voice came out of the cl@@ oud , saying , " This is my bel@@ ov@@ ed Son , in whom I am well pleased . listen to him . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , J@@ es@@ us comman@@ ded them , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
but who@@ ever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to st@@ um@@ ble , it would be better for him that a huge mil@@ l@@ stone should be hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and that he should be sun@@ k in the dep@@ ths of the sea .
if your hand or your fo@@ ot causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life ma@@ imed or crip@@ pled , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eter@@ nal fire .
if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred she@@ ep , and one of them goes as@@ tra@@ y , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he leave the n@@ in@@ ety @@@ -@@ @ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone as@@ tra@@ y ?
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gen@@ tile or a tax collec@@ tor .
again , assu@@ red@@ ly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on ear@@ th concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but because he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the ser@@ vant therefore fell down and k@@ ne@@ eled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
" but that ser@@ vant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred den@@ ar@@ ii , and he gra@@ bbed him , and took him by the thro@@ at , saying , ' P@@ ay me what you o@@ we ! '
" so his fellow ser@@ vant fell down at his feet and beg@@ ged him , saying , ' H@@ ave patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exce@@ ed@@ ingly sor@@ ry , and came and told to their lor@@ d all that was done .
it happened when J@@ es@@ us had finished these words , he depar@@ ted from Gal@@ il@@ ee , and came into the borders of Ju@@ de@@ a beyond the Jordan .
for there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were born that way from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s by men ; and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en 's sake . he who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
again I tell you , it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
everyone who has left houses , or brothers , or s@@ ist@@ ers , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , will receive one hundred times , and will inher@@ it eter@@ nal life .
" for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to h@@ ire labor@@ ers for his v@@ ine@@ yard .
" they said to him , ' Bec@@ ause no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the v@@ ine@@ yard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
take that which is yo@@ urs , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Is@@ n '@@ t it law@@ ful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye ev@@ il , because I am good ? '
but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , " You don '@@ t know what you are asking . are you able to drink the c@@ up that I am about to drink , and be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism that I am b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with ? " they said to him , " We are able . "
the multi@@ tu@@ des who went before him , and who followed kept sh@@ ou@@ ting , " Hos@@ anna to the son of David ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hos@@ anna in the highest ! "
J@@ es@@ us entered into the temp@@ le of God , and dro@@ ve out all of those who sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the money chan@@ gers ' tables and the seats of those who sold the d@@ ov@@ es .
but when the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes saw the won@@ der@@ ful things that he did , and the children who were cr@@ ying in the temp@@ le and saying , " Hos@@ anna to the son of David ! " they were in@@ dign@@ ant ,
for John came to you in the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe him , but the tax collec@@ tors and the pro@@ stitu@@ tes believed him . when you saw it , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t even rep@@ ent after@@ ward , that you might believe him .
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the he@@ ir . come , let 's kill him , and se@@ ize his inher@@ it@@ ance . '
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and spoke again in par@@ ables to them , saying ,
those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together as many as they found , both bad and good . the w@@ edding was filled with guests .
'@@ i am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
for they bin@@ d heavy bur@@ den@@ s that are gri@@ ev@@ ous to be bor@@ ne , and lay them on men 's sho@@ ul@@ ders ; but they themselves will not lift a fin@@ ger to help them .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fa@@ thers , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have been par@@ tak@@ ers with them in the blood of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . '
therefore be@@ hold , I send to you pro@@ ph@@ ets , wise men , and s@@ cri@@ bes . some of them you will kill and cru@@ ci@@ fy ; and some of them you will s@@ cour@@ ge in your syn@@ ago@@ gues , and persec@@ ute from city to city ;
J@@ es@@ us went out from the temp@@ le , and was going on his way . his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him to show him the buildings of the temp@@ le .
for nation will rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom ; and there will be fam@@ ines , plagu@@ es , and earthquakes in various places .
" when , therefore , you see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , which was spoken of through Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing in the hol@@ y place ( let the re@@ ader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shor@@ tened , no f@@ les@@ h would have been sav@@ ed . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shor@@ tened .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning fl@@ ashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the op@@ pression of those days , the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heav@@ ens will be shaken ;
and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . then all the tri@@ bes of the ear@@ th will mour@@ n , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky with power and great gl@@ ory .
he will send out his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fi@@ g tree learn this par@@ able . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship ,
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the th@@ i@@ ef was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" he also who had received the one tal@@ ent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , re@@ ap@@ ing where you did not so@@ w , and gathering where you did not sc@@ at@@ ter .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his gl@@ ory , and all the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s with him , then he will sit on the th@@ r@@ one of his gl@@ ory .
for I was hun@@ gry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thir@@ st@@ y , and you gave me drink . I was a st@@ ran@@ ger , and you took me in .
I was nak@@ ed , and you clo@@ th@@ ed me . I was si@@ ck , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' de@@ part from me , you Cur@@ sed , into the eter@@ nal fire which is prepared for the dev@@ il and his an@@ gel@@ s ;
then the chief pri@@ ests , the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has .
most certainly I tell you , wher@@ ever this Go@@ od News is pre@@ ached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but wo@@ e to that man through whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the v@@ ine from now on , until that day when I drink it an@@ ew with you in my F@@ ather 's Kingdom . "
then he came to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest . be@@ hold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
while he was still speaking , be@@ hold , Ju@@ das , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multi@@ tude with s@@ words and clubs , from the chief pri@@ est and el@@ ders of the people .
be@@ hold , one of those who were with J@@ es@@ us stret@@ ched out his hand , and drew his s@@ word , and struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and struck off his e@@ ar .
in that hour J@@ es@@ us said to the multi@@ tu@@ des , " H@@ ave you come out as against a rob@@ ber with s@@ words and clubs to se@@ ize me ? I sat daily in the temp@@ le teaching , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t arrest me .
then they sp@@ it in his face and beat him with their f@@ ists , and some sla@@ pped him ,
now when morning had come , all the chief pri@@ ests and the el@@ ders of the people took coun@@ sel against J@@ es@@ us to put him to death :
and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate , the governor .
the chief pri@@ ests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It 's not law@@ ful to put them into the treas@@ ury , since it is the price of blood . "
when they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off of him , and put his clo@@ th@@ es on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
as they came out , they found a man of Cy@@ ren@@ e , Simon by name , and they comp@@ elled him to go with them , that he might carry his cross .
those who passed by b@@ las@@ phe@@ med him , w@@ ag@@ ging their heads ,
be@@ hold , the ve@@ il of the temp@@ le was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the ear@@ th qu@@ aked and the ro@@ cks were split .
now the centur@@ ion , and those who were with him watching J@@ es@@ us , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , fear@@ ed exce@@ ed@@ ingly , saying , " T@@ rul@@ y this was the Son of God . "
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean lin@@ en clo@@ th ,
command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest perhaps his dis@@ cip@@ les come at night and ste@@ al him away , and tell the people , ' He is risen from the dead ; ' and the last dec@@ eption will be worse than the first . "
be@@ hold , there was a great earthquake , for an an@@ gel of the Lord des@@ cen@@ ded from the sky , and came and rol@@ led away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
as they went to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les , be@@ hold , J@@ es@@ us met them , saying , " re@@ jo@@ ice ! " they came and took hold of his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
now while they were going , be@@ hold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief pri@@ ests all the things that had happened .
now after John was taken into custody , J@@ es@@ us came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , pre@@ aching the Go@@ od News of the Kingdom of God ,
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat men@@ ding the n@@ ets .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were si@@ ck , and those who were poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons .
a le@@ per came to him , beg@@ ging him , k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy depar@@ ted from him , and he was made clean .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the ro@@ of where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the M@@ at that the paral@@ y@@ tic was lying on .
he ar@@ ose , and immediately took up the M@@ at , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amaz@@ ed , and gl@@ ori@@ fied God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
it happened , that he was rec@@ lining at the table in his house , and many tax collec@@ tors and sin@@ ners sat down with J@@ es@@ us and his dis@@ cip@@ les , for there were many , and they followed him .
no one puts new wine into old win@@ esk@@ ins , or else the new wine will bur@@ st the sk@@ ins , and the wine po@@ urs out , and the sk@@ ins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into fresh win@@ esk@@ ins . "
it happened that he was going on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day through the gra@@ in fields , and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of gra@@ in .
how he entered into God 's house when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar was high pri@@ est , and ate the show bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat except for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
when he had looked around at them with an@@ ger , being gri@@ ev@@ ed at the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts , he said to the man , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand . " he stret@@ ched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
he spoke to his dis@@ cip@@ les that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t press on him .
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to pl@@ under , unless he first bin@@ ds the strong man ; and then he will pl@@ under his house .
again he began to te@@ ach by the seaside . a great multi@@ tude was gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat in the sea , and sat down . all the multi@@ tude were on the land by the sea .
and it happened , as he so@@ wed , some se@@ ed fell by the road , and the birds came and dev@@ oured it .
others fell on the ro@@ cky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sp@@ ran@@ g up , because it had no dep@@ th of soil .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perce@@ ive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sin@@ s should be for@@ given them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is so@@ wn ; and when they have heard , immediately S@@ atan comes , and takes away the word which has been so@@ wn in them .
for who@@ ever has , to him will more be given , and he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
because he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been torn apart by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to t@@ ame him .
always , night and day , in the tom@@ bs and in the mountains , he was cr@@ ying out , and cutting himself with stones .
and cr@@ ying out with a l@@ oud voice , he said , " What have I to do with you , J@@ es@@ us , you Son of the Most High God ? I adj@@ ure you by God , don '@@ t tor@@ ment me . "
at once J@@ es@@ us gave them permission . the un@@ clean spir@@ its came out and entered into the p@@ ig@@ s . the her@@ d of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and they were dro@@ w@@ ned in the sea .
those who f@@ ed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to J@@ es@@ us , and saw him who had been poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legi@@ on ; and they were afraid .
when J@@ es@@ us had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multi@@ tude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
and had suffered many things by many physi@@ cians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better , but rather grew worse ,
immediately the flow of her blood was dri@@ ed up , and she felt in her body that she was he@@ aled of her aff@@ li@@ ction .
but the woman , fearing and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , kno@@ wing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
they ri@@ dic@@ uled him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
who@@ ever will not receive you nor hear you , as you de@@ part from there , shake off the d@@ ust that is under your feet for a testimony against them . As@@ su@@ red@@ ly , I tell you , it will be more toler@@ able for So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h in the day of judgment than for that city ! "
but Her@@ od , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I be@@ headed . he has risen from the dead . "
when the daughter of Her@@ odi@@ as her@@ self came in and dan@@ ced , she pleased Her@@ od and those sitting with him . the king said to the young la@@ dy , " As@@ k me whatever you want , and I will give it to you . "
the king was exce@@ ed@@ ingly sor@@ ry , but for the sake of his o@@ aths , and of his din@@ ner guests , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and comman@@ ded to bring John 's head , and he went and be@@ headed him in the prison ,
the A@@ post@@ les gathered themselves together to J@@ es@@ us , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had ta@@ ught .
J@@ es@@ us came out , saw a great multi@@ tude , and he had comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they were like she@@ ep without a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , and he began to te@@ ach them many things .
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed and broke the lo@@ aves , and he gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " che@@ er up ! it is I ! D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . "
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ce@@ ased , and they were very amaz@@ ed among themselves , and mar@@ v@@ eled ;
now when they saw some of his dis@@ cip@@ les e@@ ating bread with def@@ iled , that is , un@@ was@@ hed , hands , they found fault .
( for the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and all the Jews , don '@@ t eat unless they was@@ h their hands and fore@@ arms , holding to the tradition of the el@@ ders .
they don '@@ t eat when they come from the market@@ place , unless they ba@@ the themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : w@@ ash@@ ings of c@@ ups , pit@@ chers , bronze vessels , and cou@@ ches . )
" for you set aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , and hold tigh@@ tly to the tradition of men@@ -@@ -@@ the w@@ ashing of pit@@ chers and c@@ ups , and you do many other such things . "
for Mos@@ es said , ' hon@@ or your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks ev@@ il of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can def@@ ile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that def@@ ile the man .
from there he ar@@ ose , and went away into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on . he entered into a house , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t want anyone to know it , but he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t escape no@@ tice .
she went away to her house , and found the child having been laid on the bed , with the dem@@ on gone out .
again he depar@@ ted from the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and came to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , through the mid@@ st of the region of Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
they brought to him one who was de@@ af and had an im@@ pedi@@ ment in his speech . they beg@@ ged him to lay his hand on him .
if I send them away fas@@ ting to their home , they will fa@@ int on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven lo@@ aves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his dis@@ cip@@ les to serve , and they served the multi@@ tude .
he took hold of the b@@ lin@@ d man by the hand , and brought him out of the village . when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and laid his hands on him , he asked him if he saw anything .
he began to te@@ ach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the el@@ ders , the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multi@@ tude to himself with his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " W@@ ho@@ ever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for who@@ ever wants to save his life will lose it ; and who@@ ever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Go@@ od News will save it .
after six days J@@ es@@ us took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain priv@@ ately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he comman@@ ded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for he was teaching his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
he sat down , and called the twelve ; and he said to them , " If any man wants to be first , he shall be last of all , and ser@@ vant of all . "
for who@@ ever will give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because you are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
if your hand causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life ma@@ imed , rather than having your two hands to go into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire ,
if your fo@@ ot causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life la@@ me , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the fire that will never be qu@@ en@@ ch@@ ed@@ --
if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire ,
for everyone will be sal@@ ted with fire , and every sacrifice will be se@@ as@@ oned with salt .
he ar@@ ose from there and came into the borders of Ju@@ de@@ a and beyond the Jordan . multi@@ tu@@ des came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
but when J@@ es@@ us saw it , he was moved with in@@ dign@@ ation , and said to them , " allow the little children to come to me ! D@@ on '@@ t for@@ bid them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
you know the comman@@ d@@ ments : ' do not murder , ' ' D@@ o not commit ad@@ ul@@ tery , ' ' D@@ o not ste@@ al , ' ' D@@ o not give false testimony , ' ' D@@ o not def@@ ra@@ ud , ' ' hon@@ or your father and mother . ' "
it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
they said to him , " G@@ rant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your gl@@ ory . "
they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o . as he went out from Jer@@ ich@@ o , with his dis@@ cip@@ les and a great multi@@ tude , the son of Tim@@ a@@ e@@ us , Bar@@ ti@@ ma@@ e@@ us , a b@@ lin@@ d beg@@ gar , was sitting by the road .
when he heard that it was J@@ es@@ us the N@@ azar@@ ene , he began to cry out , and say , " J@@ es@@ us , you son of David , have mer@@ cy on me ! "
many spread their gar@@ ments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
those who went in front , and those who followed , cri@@ ed out , " Hos@@ anna ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
b@@ les@@ sed is the k@@ ing@@ dom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hos@@ anna in the highest ! "
seeing a fi@@ g tree af@@ ar off having leaves , he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it . when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for fig@@ s .
they came to Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ es@@ us entered into the temp@@ le , and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the money chan@@ gers , and the seats of those who sold the d@@ ov@@ es .
he ta@@ ught , saying to them , " Is@@ n '@@ t it written , ' My house will be called a house of pray@@ er for all the nations ? ' but you have made it a den of rob@@ bers ! "
for most certainly I tell you , who@@ ever may tell this mountain , ' Be taken up and cast into the sea , ' and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is happening ; he shall have whatever he says .
when it was time , he sent a ser@@ vant to the far@@ mer to get from the far@@ mer his share of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
again , he sent another ser@@ vant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away sha@@ me@@ fully treated .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? " but he , kno@@ wing their hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , said to them , " Wh@@ y do you test me ? bring me a den@@ ar@@ i@@ us , that I may see it . "
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered them , " ren@@ der to Ca@@ es@@ ar the things that are Ca@@ es@@ ar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . " they mar@@ v@@ eled greatly at him .
for when they will rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage , but are like an@@ gel@@ s in heav@@ en .
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neigh@@ bor as himself , is more important than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . "
for David himself said in the Holy Spiri@@ t , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enem@@ ies the foot@@ st@@ ool of your feet . " '
for nation will rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom . there will be earthquakes in various places . there will be fam@@ ines and troub@@ les . these things are the beginning of birth pain@@ s .
when they lead you away and deliver you up , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious be@@ fore@@ hand , or pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spiri@@ t .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be ha@@ ted by all men for my name 's sake , but he who en@@ du@@ res to the end , the same will be sav@@ ed .
but when you see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not ( let the re@@ ader understand ) , then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains ,
then he will send out his an@@ gel@@ s , and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from the ends of the ear@@ th to the ends of the sky .
" now from the fi@@ g tree , learn this par@@ able . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also comman@@ ded the do@@ or@@ keep@@ er to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over and the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might se@@ ize him by dec@@ eption , and kill him .
for you always have the poor with you , and wh@@ en@@ ever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
most certainly I tell you , wher@@ ever this Go@@ od News may be pre@@ ached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
and wher@@ ever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Te@@ acher says , " W@@ here is the guest room , where I may eat the P@@ ass@@ over with my dis@@ cip@@ les ? " '
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but wo@@ e to that man by whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
as they were e@@ ating , J@@ es@@ us took bread , and when he had b@@ les@@ sed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " T@@ ake , eat . this is my body . "
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the v@@ ine , until that day when I drink it an@@ ew in the Kingdom of God . "
he came the third time , and said to them , " S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest . it is enough . the hour has come . be@@ hold , the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
but a certain one of those who stood by drew his s@@ word , and struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his e@@ ar .
a certain young man followed him , having a lin@@ en clo@@ th thrown around himself , over his nak@@ ed body . the young men gra@@ bbed him ,
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high pri@@ est . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
some began to sp@@ it on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with f@@ ists , and to tell him , " Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ! " the officers struck him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
but he again denied it . after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Gal@@ il@@ ean , and your speech shows it . "
immediately in the morning the chief pri@@ ests , with the el@@ ders and s@@ cri@@ bes , and the whole council , held a consultation , and bound J@@ es@@ us , and carried him away , and delivered him up to P@@ il@@ ate .
they comp@@ elled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cy@@ ren@@ e , the father of Alexander and Ru@@ f@@ us , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
they brought him to the place called gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , which is , being interpreted , " The place of a s@@ kul@@ l . "
the super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption of his accus@@ ation was written over him , " the King of the Jews . "
one ran , and filling a spon@@ ge full of vin@@ eg@@ ar , put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . let 's see whether Eli@@ j@@ ah comes to take him down . "
when the centur@@ ion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cri@@ ed out like this and bre@@ ath@@ ed his last , he said , " T@@ rul@@ y this man was the Son of God ! "
he bought a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and taking him down , wo@@ und him in the lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rol@@ led a stone against the door of the tomb .
entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , d@@ ressed in a white ro@@ be , and they were amaz@@ ed .
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling and ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
after@@ ward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he re@@ bu@@ ked them for their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
so then the Lord , after he had spoken to them , was received up into heav@@ en , and sat down at the right hand of God .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ de@@ a , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the pri@@ est@@ ly division of A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah . he had a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
according to the cust@@ om of the pri@@ est 's office , his lot was to enter into the temp@@ le of the Lord and bur@@ n incen@@ se .
but the an@@ gel said to him , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he will drink no wine nor strong drink . he will be filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , even from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
be@@ hold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le . he continued making signs to them , and remained m@@ ute .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he depar@@ ted to his house .
be@@ hold , you will conce@@ ive in your w@@ om@@ b , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' J@@ es@@ us . '
the an@@ gel answ@@ ered her , " The Holy Spiri@@ t will come on you , and the power of the Most High will over@@ shadow you . therefore also the hol@@ y one who is born from you will be called the Son of God .
for be@@ hold , when the voice of your gre@@ et@@ ing came into my e@@ ars , the baby le@@ ap@@ ed in my w@@ om@@ b for joy !
b@@ les@@ sed is she who believed , for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord ! "
it happened on the eighth day , that they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they would have called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of the father .
Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ de@@ a , to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
to enrol@@ l himself with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him as wife , being pregn@@ ant .
it happened , when the an@@ gel@@ s went away from them into the sky , that the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , " Let 's go to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , now , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
when the days of their pur@@ ification according to the law of Mos@@ es were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jer@@ usalem , to present him to the Lord
be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righ@@ te@@ ous and dev@@ out , looking for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel , and the Holy Spiri@@ t was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spiri@@ t that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for my eyes have seen your sal@@ vation ,
coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for re@@ dem@@ ption in Jer@@ usalem .
the child was growing , and was becoming strong in spirit , being filled with wis@@ dom , and the grace of God was upon him .
it happened after three days they found him in the temp@@ le , sitting in the mid@@ st of the teachers , both list@@ ening to them , and asking them questions .
now in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate being governor of Ju@@ de@@ a , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of the region of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and T@@ rac@@ hon@@ itis , and Ly@@ san@@ ias te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
as it is written in the book of the words of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , " The voice of one cr@@ ying in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , ' Mak@@ e ready the way of the Lord . make his p@@ aths stra@@ ight .
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and don '@@ t begin to say among yo@@ ur@@ selves , ' We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Ab@@ ra@@ ham from these stones !
even now the ax@@ e also lies at the root of the trees . every tree therefore that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
whose fan is in his hand , and he will thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly cleans@@ e his th@@ res@@ hing floor , and will gather the wheat into his bar@@ n ; but he will bur@@ n up the c@@ haf@@ f with un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire . "
J@@ es@@ us himself , when he began to te@@ ach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of H@@ eli ,
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the dev@@ il , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world in a moment of time .
he led him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on the pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yo@@ ur@@ self down from here ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the atten@@ d@@ ant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the bro@@ w of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the c@@ lif@@ f .
amaz@@ ement came on all , and they spoke together , one with another , saying , " What is this word ? for with authority and power he comman@@ ds the un@@ clean spir@@ its , and they come out ! "
he rose up from the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law was aff@@ lic@@ ted with a great f@@ ever , and they beg@@ ged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any si@@ ck with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
when it was day , he depar@@ ted and went into an un@@ inhabited place , and the multi@@ tu@@ des looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t go away from them .
now it happened , while the multi@@ tude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gen@@ nes@@ aret .
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multi@@ tude , they went up to the hous@@ et@@ op , and let him down through the ti@@ les with his co@@ t into the mid@@ st before J@@ es@@ us .
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on ear@@ th to for@@ give sin@@ s " ( he said to the paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed man ) , " I tell you , arise , and take up your co@@ t , and go to your house . "
now it happened on the second Sab@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he was going through the gra@@ in fields . his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the heads of gra@@ in , and ate , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
but some of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees said to them , " Wh@@ y do you do that which is not law@@ ful to do on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day ? "
J@@ es@@ us , answ@@ ering them , said , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you read what David did when he was hun@@ gry , he , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not law@@ ful to eat except for the pri@@ ests alone ? "
it also happened on another Sab@@ b@@ ath that he entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue and ta@@ ught . there was a man there , and his right hand was with@@ ered .
b@@ les@@ sed are you when men shall h@@ ate you , and when they shall exclu@@ de and mo@@ ck you , and throw out your name as ev@@ il , for the Son of Man 's sake .
re@@ jo@@ ice in that day , and le@@ ap for joy , for be@@ hold , your reward is great in heav@@ en , for their fa@@ thers did the same thing to the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
to him who strikes you on the che@@ ek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your clo@@ ak , don '@@ t with@@ hold your co@@ at also .
" give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will be given to you . for with the same measure you measure it will be meas@@ ured back to you . "
why do you see the spec@@ k of c@@ haf@@ f that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don '@@ t gather fig@@ s from thor@@ ns , nor do they gather grap@@ es from a br@@ am@@ ble b@@ ush .
the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good , and the ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart brings out that which is ev@@ il , for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart , his m@@ outh speaks .
everyone who comes to me , and he@@ ars my words , and does them , I will show you who he is like .
those who were sent , returning to the house , found that the ser@@ vant who had been si@@ ck was well .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , be@@ hold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a wi@@ dow . many people of the city were with her .
this is he of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
" for I tell you , among those who are born of women there is not a greater pro@@ phe@@ t than John the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ zer , yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he . "
they are like children who sit in the market@@ place , and call one to another , saying , ' We pip@@ ed to you , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dance . we mour@@ ned , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t we@@ ep . '
one of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees invited him to eat with him . he entered into the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee 's house , and sat at the table .
now when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a pro@@ phe@@ t , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who tou@@ ches him , that she is a sin@@ ner . "
it happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , pre@@ aching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God . with him were the twelve ,
other se@@ ed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it with@@ ered away , because it had no mo@@ ist@@ ure .
other fell into the good ground , and grew , and brought forth fruit one hundred times . " as he said these things , he called out , " He who has e@@ ars to hear , let him hear ! "
those along the road are those who hear , then the dev@@ il comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be sav@@ ed .
those on the rock are they who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; but these have no root , who believe for a while , then fall away in time of temp@@ tation .
that which fell among the thor@@ ns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are ch@@ oked with car@@ es , ri@@ ches , and pleas@@ ures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
" no one , when he has lit a lam@@ p , covers it with a contain@@ er , or puts it under a bed ; but puts it on a stand , that those who enter in may see the light .
now it happened on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his dis@@ cip@@ les , and he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side of the lake . " so they launched out .
when J@@ es@@ us stepped ash@@ ore , a certain man out of the city who had dem@@ ons for a long time met him . he wor@@ e no clo@@ th@@ es , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t live in a house , but in the tom@@ bs .
the dem@@ ons came out from the man , and entered into the p@@ ig@@ s , and the her@@ d rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were dro@@ w@@ ned .
be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue . he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and beg@@ ged him to come into his house ,
for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . but as he went , the multi@@ tu@@ des pressed against him .
J@@ es@@ us said , " Wh@@ o touched me ? " when all denied it , Peter and those with him said , " Mas@@ ter , the multi@@ tu@@ des press and j@@ ost@@ le you , and you say , ' Wh@@ o touched me ? ' "
when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
as many as don '@@ t receive you , when you de@@ part from that city , shake off even the d@@ ust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he b@@ les@@ sed them , and broke them , and gave them to the dis@@ cip@@ les to set before the multi@@ tude .
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the el@@ ders , chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for who@@ ever desi@@ res to save his life will lose it , but who@@ ever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
for who@@ ever will be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he comes in his gl@@ ory , and the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way tas@@ te of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sle@@ ep , but when they were fully aw@@ ake , they saw his gl@@ ory , and the two men who stood with him .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multi@@ tude met him .
while he was still coming , the dem@@ on threw him down and conv@@ ul@@ sed him viol@@ ently . but J@@ es@@ us re@@ bu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and he@@ aled the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand this saying . it was conce@@ aled from them , that they should not perce@@ ive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he in@@ t@@ ently set his face to go to Jer@@ usalem ,
when his dis@@ cip@@ les , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Eli@@ j@@ ah did ? "
but he turned and re@@ bu@@ ked them , " You don '@@ t know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
J@@ es@@ us said to him , " The fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les , and the birds of the sky have nes@@ ts , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
" Wo@@ e to you , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! Wo@@ e to you , B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida ! for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works had been done in T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on which were done in you , they would have re@@ pen@@ ted long ago , sitting in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
turning to the dis@@ cip@@ les , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my F@@ ather . no one knows who the Son is , except the F@@ ather , and who the F@@ ather is , except the Son , and he to who@@ mev@@ er the Son desi@@ res to reveal him . "
for I tell you that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and kings desi@@ red to see the things which you see , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear them . "
in the same way a Lev@@ ite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
came to him , and bound up his wounds , po@@ uring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an In@@ n , and took care of him .
on the next day , when he depar@@ ted , he took out two den@@ ar@@ ii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' T@@ ake care of him . whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '
he said to them , " When you pra@@ y , say , ' Our F@@ ather in heav@@ en , may your name be kept hol@@ y . May your Kingdom come . May your will be done on ear@@ th , as it is in heav@@ en .
for@@ give us our sin@@ s , for we ourselves also for@@ give everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temp@@ tation , but deliver us from the ev@@ il one . ' "
I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his pers@@ istence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep kno@@ cking , and it will be opened to you .
" which of you fa@@ thers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won '@@ t give him a sn@@ ake instead of a fish , will he ?
he was casting out a dem@@ on , and it was m@@ ute . it happened , when the dem@@ on had gone out , the m@@ ute man spoke ; and the multi@@ tu@@ des mar@@ v@@ eled .
the un@@ clean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through d@@ ry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multi@@ tude lifted up her voice , and said to him , " b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ ore you , and the bre@@ asts which nur@@ sed you ! "
the lam@@ p of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is ev@@ il , your body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wh@@ ol@@ ly full of light , as when the lam@@ p with its bright sh@@ ining gives you light . "
Wo@@ e to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don '@@ t know it . "
as he said these things to them , the s@@ cri@@ bes and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees began to be ter@@ ri@@ bly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
meanwhile , when a multi@@ tude of many thousands had gathered together , so much so that they tr@@ amp@@ led on each other , he began to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les first of all , " be@@ w@@ are of the ye@@ ast of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , which is hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
therefore whatever you have said in the d@@ ark@@ ness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the e@@ ar in the in@@ ner rooms will be proclaimed on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
" I tell you , my friends , don '@@ t be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but the very ha@@ ir@@ s of your head are all num@@ ber@@ ed . therefore don '@@ t be afraid . you are of more value than many spar@@ ro@@ ws .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be for@@ given , but those who b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme against the Holy Spiri@@ t will not be for@@ given .
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my gra@@ in and my goods .
but if this is how God clo@@ th@@ es the gr@@ ass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the ov@@ en , how much more will he clo@@ the you , O you of little faith ?
sell that which you have , and give gifts to the ne@@ edy . make for yo@@ ur@@ selves pur@@ ses which don '@@ t grow old , a treasure in the heav@@ ens that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fail , where no th@@ i@@ ef approaches , neither mo@@ th destro@@ ys .
be like men watching for their lor@@ d , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and kno@@ cks , they may immediately open to him .
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will d@@ ress himself , and make them rec@@ line , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the th@@ i@@ ef was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
but he who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , and did things wor@@ thy of stri@@ pes , will be beaten with few stri@@ pes . to who@@ mev@@ er much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entr@@ usted , of him more will be asked .
they will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . "
it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and put in his own gar@@ den . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lo@@ d@@ ged in its branches . "
they will come from the east , west , north , and south , and will sit down in the Kingdom of God .
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rul@@ ers of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees on a Sab@@ b@@ ath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " b@@ les@@ sed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bear his own cross , and come after me , can '@@ t be my dis@@ cip@@ le .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the man@@ ure p@@ ile . it is thrown out . he who has e@@ ars to hear , let him hear . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his sho@@ ul@@ ders , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors , saying , ' re@@ jo@@ ice with me , for I have found the d@@ rac@@ h@@ ma which I had lost . '
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " F@@ ather , I have sin@@ ned against heav@@ en , and in your sight .
" he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
he cri@@ ed and said , ' F@@ ather Ab@@ ra@@ ham , have mer@@ cy on me , and send Lazar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his fin@@ ger in water , and co@@ ol my ton@@ gue ! for I am in an@@ gu@@ ish in this fla@@ me . '
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
it would be better for him if a mil@@ l@@ stone were hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to st@@ um@@ ble .
but who is there among you , having a ser@@ vant p@@ low@@ ing or keeping she@@ ep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' C@@ ome immediately and sit down at the table , '
he said to the dis@@ cip@@ les , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , when it fl@@ ashes out of the one part under the sky , sh@@ ines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
as it happened in the days of No@@ ah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they d@@ rank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they d@@ rank , they bought , they sold , they plan@@ ted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from So@@ dom , it ra@@ ined fire and sul@@ f@@ ur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the hous@@ et@@ op , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
you know the comman@@ d@@ ments : ' D@@ on '@@ t commit ad@@ ul@@ tery , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t murder , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t ste@@ al , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t give false testimony , ' ' hon@@ or your father and your mother . ' "
for it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to enter in through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " be@@ hold , we are going up to Jer@@ usalem , and all the things that are written through the pro@@ ph@@ ets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
" it happened when he had come back again , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , that he comman@@ ded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
for I fear@@ ed you , because you are an ex@@ acting man . you take up that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t lay down , and re@@ ap that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t so@@ w . '
then why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
for the days will come on you , when your enem@@ ies will throw up a barri@@ c@@ ade against you , sur@@ round you , hem you in on every side ,
and will d@@ ash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know the time of your vis@@ itation . "
it happened on one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the temp@@ le and pre@@ aching the Go@@ od News , that the pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes came to him with the el@@ ders .
he answ@@ ered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
at the proper season , he sent a ser@@ vant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reas@@ oned among themselves , saying , ' This is the he@@ ir . come , let 's kill him , that the inher@@ it@@ ance may be ours . '
but those who are considered wor@@ thy to at@@ tain to that age and the resur@@ rec@@ tion from the dead , neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage .
but that the dead are raised , even Mos@@ es showed at the b@@ ush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . '
he said , " Watch out that you don '@@ t get led as@@ tra@@ y , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' therefore don '@@ t follow them .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains . let those who are in the mid@@ st of her de@@ part . let those who are in the country not enter there@@ in .
they will fall by the edge of the s@@ word , and will be led cap@@ tive into all the nations . Jer@@ usalem will be tr@@ amp@@ led down by the Gen@@ ti@@ les , until the times of the Gen@@ ti@@ les are fulfilled .
men fa@@ in@@ ting for fear , and for expec@@ tation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heav@@ ens will be shaken .
when they are already bud@@ ding , you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near .
every day J@@ es@@ us was teaching in the temp@@ le , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Oli@@ vet .
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
for who is greater , one who s@@ its at the table , or one who serves ? Is@@ n '@@ t it he who s@@ its at the table ? but I am in the mid@@ st of you as one who serves .
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the s@@ word ? "
a certain one of them struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his right e@@ ar .
when I was with you in the temp@@ le daily , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of d@@ ark@@ ness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high pri@@ est 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
when they had kin@@ d@@ led a fire in the middle of the cour@@ t@@ yard , and had sat down together , Peter sat among them .
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the el@@ ders of the people was gathered together , both chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
when he found out that he was in Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who was also in Jer@@ usalem during those days .
now when Her@@ od saw J@@ es@@ us , he was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some mir@@ acle done by him .
for be@@ hold , the days are coming in which they will say , ' b@@ les@@ sed are the bar@@ ren , the w@@ om@@ bs that never b@@ ore , and the bre@@ asts that never nur@@ sed . '
when they came to the place that is called The s@@ kul@@ l , they cru@@ ci@@ fied him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
an ins@@ cri@@ ption was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
( he had not consen@@ ted to their coun@@ sel and de@@ ed ) , from Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
he took it down , and wrapped it in a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
but on the first day of the week , at early da@@ wn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of s@@ inf@@ ul men , and be cru@@ ci@@ fied , and the third day rise again ? "
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
it happened , while he b@@ les@@ sed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heav@@ en .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
the Wor@@ d became f@@ les@@ h , and lived among us . we saw his gl@@ ory , such gl@@ ory as of the one and only Son of the F@@ ather , full of grace and truth .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bos@@ om of the F@@ ather , he has declared him .
I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize him , but he who sent me to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze in water , he said to me , ' On who@@ mev@@ er you will see the Spiri@@ t des@@ cen@@ ding , and remaining on him , the same is he who b@@ ap@@ ti@@ zes in the Holy Spiri@@ t . '
J@@ es@@ us turned , and saw them following , and said to them , " What are you looking for ? " they said to him , " R@@ ab@@ bi " ( which is to say , being interpreted , Te@@ acher ) , " where are you staying ? "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , her@@ e@@ after you will see heav@@ en opened , and the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on the Son of Man . "
after this , he went down to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his dis@@ cip@@ les ; and they stayed there a few days .
he made a w@@ hip of cor@@ ds , and threw all out of the temp@@ le , both the she@@ ep and the ox@@ en ; and he p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw their tables .
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his dis@@ cip@@ les remember@@ ed that he said this , and they believed the S@@ crip@@ ture , and the word which J@@ es@@ us had said .
now when he was in Jer@@ usalem at the P@@ ass@@ over , during the feast , many believed in his name , obser@@ ving his signs which he did .
Nic@@ o@@ de@@ mu@@ s said to him , " Ho@@ w can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and be born ? "
that which is born of the f@@ les@@ h is f@@ les@@ h . that which is born of the Spiri@@ t is spirit .
the wind blo@@ ws where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don '@@ t know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spiri@@ t . "
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don '@@ t receive our witness .
no one has as@@ cen@@ ded into heav@@ en , but he who des@@ cen@@ ded out of heav@@ en , the Son of Man , who is in heav@@ en .
he who believes in him is not jud@@ ged . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe has been jud@@ ged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
he who has the bri@@ de is the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om ; but the friend of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , who stands and he@@ ars him , re@@ jo@@ ices greatly because of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om 's voice . this , my joy , therefore is made full .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the ear@@ th belongs to the ear@@ th , and speaks of the ear@@ th . he who comes from heav@@ en is above all .
but who@@ ever drin@@ ks of the water that I will give him will never thir@@ st again ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water spr@@ inging up to eter@@ nal life . "
you worship that which you don '@@ t know . we worship that which we know ; for sal@@ vation is from the Jews .
the woman said to him , " I know that Mes@@ si@@ ah comes , " ( he who is called Ch@@ r@@ ist ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
so when he came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , the Gal@@ il@@ e@@ ans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jer@@ usalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
when he heard that J@@ es@@ us had come out of Ju@@ de@@ a into Gal@@ il@@ ee , he went to him , and beg@@ ged him that he would come down and he@@ al his son , for he was at the point of death .
J@@ es@@ us said to him , " G@@ o your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that J@@ es@@ us spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Y@@ our child lives ! "
so he inqu@@ ired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Y@@ es@@ ter@@ day at the seventh hour , the f@@ ever left him . "
now in Jer@@ usalem by the she@@ ep gate , there is a pool , which is called in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " B@@ eth@@ es@@ da , " having five por@@ ches .
in these lay a great multi@@ tude of those who were si@@ ck , b@@ lin@@ d , la@@ me , or paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
for this cause the Jews persec@@ uted J@@ es@@ us , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sab@@ b@@ ath .
for the F@@ ather has aff@@ ection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may mar@@ v@@ el .
" most certainly I tell you , he who he@@ ars my word , and believes him who sent me , has eter@@ nal life , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
D@@ on '@@ t mar@@ v@@ el at this , for the hour comes , in which all that are in the tom@@ bs will hear his voice ,
and will come out ; those who have done good , to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of life ; and those who have done ev@@ il , to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of judgment .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righ@@ te@@ ous ; because I don '@@ t seek my own will , but the will of my F@@ ather who sent me .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be sav@@ ed .
but the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the F@@ ather gave me to accomp@@ lish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the F@@ ather has sent me .
" D@@ on '@@ t think that I will accuse you to the F@@ ather . there is one who acc@@ uses you , even Mos@@ es , on whom you have set your hope .
after these things , J@@ es@@ us went away to the other side of the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , which is also called the Sea of Ti@@ ber@@ ias .
J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desi@@ red .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with broken pieces from the five bar@@ ley lo@@ aves , which were left over by those who had e@@ aten .
J@@ es@@ us therefore , perce@@ i@@ ving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had ro@@ wed about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five or thirty stadi@@ a , they saw J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
on the next day , the multi@@ tude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one in which his dis@@ cip@@ les had embar@@ ked , and that J@@ es@@ us h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t entered with his dis@@ cip@@ les into the boat , but his dis@@ cip@@ les had gone away alone .
when the multi@@ tude therefore saw that J@@ es@@ us was@@ n '@@ t there , nor his dis@@ cip@@ les , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , seeking J@@ es@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it was@@ n '@@ t Mos@@ es who gave you the bread out of heav@@ en , but my F@@ ather gives you the true bread out of heav@@ en .
all those whom the F@@ ather gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
this is the will of my F@@ ather who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eter@@ nal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
I am the living bread which came down out of heav@@ en . if anyone e@@ ats of this bread , he will live fore@@ ver . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my f@@ les@@ h . "
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don '@@ t have life in yo@@ ur@@ selves .
as the living F@@ ather sent me , and I live because of the F@@ ather ; so he who fe@@ eds on me , he will also live because of me .
it is the spirit who gives life . the f@@ les@@ h profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
but there are some of you who don '@@ t believe . " for J@@ es@@ us knew from the beginning who they were who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe , and who it was who would bet@@ ray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my F@@ ather . "
now the feast of the Jews , the Fe@@ ast of bo@@ o@@ ths , was at hand .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own gl@@ ory , but he who seeks the gl@@ ory of him who sent him is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
if a boy receives circum@@ c@@ ision on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , that the law of Mos@@ es may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ?
but of the multi@@ tude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Ch@@ r@@ ist comes , he won '@@ t do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
what is this word that he said , ' You will seek me , and won '@@ t find me ; and where I am , you can '@@ t come ' ? "
but he said this about the Spiri@@ t , which those believ@@ ing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spiri@@ t was not yet given , because J@@ es@@ us was@@ n '@@ t yet gl@@ ori@@ fied .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . J@@ es@@ us was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
again , therefore , J@@ es@@ us spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . he who follows me will not walk in the d@@ ark@@ ness , but will have the light of life . "
J@@ es@@ us said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sin@@ s . where I go , you can '@@ t come . "
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my F@@ ather ta@@ ught me , I say these things .
I say the things which I have seen with my F@@ ather ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Ab@@ ra@@ ham di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do this .
therefore J@@ es@@ us said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I ha@@ ven '@@ t come of myself , but he sent me .
you have not known him , but I know him . if I said , ' I don '@@ t know him , ' I would be like you , a li@@ ar . but I know him , and keep his word .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but J@@ es@@ us was hidden , and went out of the temp@@ le , having gone through their mid@@ st , and so passed by .
when he had said this , he sp@@ at on the ground , made mu@@ d with the sal@@ i@@ va , ano@@ in@@ ted the b@@ lin@@ d man 's eyes with the mu@@ d ,
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been b@@ lin@@ d , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
but how he now sees , we don '@@ t know ; or who opened his eyes , we don '@@ t know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they fear@@ ed the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would conf@@ ess him as Ch@@ r@@ ist , he would be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
we know that God has spoken to Mos@@ es . but as for this man , we don '@@ t know where he comes from . "
we know that God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to sin@@ ners , but if anyone is a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and does his will , he list@@ ens to him .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t enter by the door into the she@@ ep fold , but clim@@ bs up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
they will by no means follow a st@@ ran@@ ger , but will flee from him ; for they don '@@ t know the voice of st@@ ran@@ gers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be sav@@ ed , and will go in and go out , and will find pas@@ ture .
he who is a hired hand , and not a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t own the she@@ ep , sees the w@@ ol@@ f coming , leaves the she@@ ep , and fle@@ es . the w@@ ol@@ f sn@@ at@@ ches the she@@ ep , and sc@@ at@@ ters them .
I have other she@@ ep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this comman@@ d@@ ment from my F@@ ather . "
my F@@ ather , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to sn@@ at@@ ch them out of my F@@ ather 's hand .
do you say of him whom the F@@ ather sanc@@ ti@@ fied and sent into the world , ' You b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
he said these things , and after that , he said to them , " Our friend , Lazar@@ us , has fallen as@@ le@@ ep , but I am going so that I may aw@@ ake him out of sle@@ ep . "
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secre@@ tly , saying , " The Te@@ acher is here , and is calling you . "
therefore when Mary came to where J@@ es@@ us was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have died . "
when J@@ es@@ us therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews we@@ eping who came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
J@@ es@@ us said , " T@@ ake away the stone . " Mar@@ th@@ a , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a st@@ en@@ ch , for he has been dead four days . "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . J@@ es@@ us lifted up his eyes , and said , " F@@ ather , I than@@ k you that you list@@ ened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and fo@@ ot with wrap@@ p@@ ings , and his face was wrapped around with a clo@@ th . J@@ es@@ us said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
now the P@@ ass@@ over of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jer@@ usalem before the P@@ ass@@ over , to pur@@ ify themselves .
then they sought for J@@ es@@ us and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temp@@ le , " What do you thin@@ k@@ -@@ -@@ that he is@@ n '@@ t coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had comman@@ ded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might se@@ ize him .
then six days before the P@@ ass@@ over , J@@ es@@ us came to B@@ eth@@ any , where Lazar@@ us was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
Mary , therefore , took a po@@ und of o@@ in@@ tment of p@@ ure N@@ ard , very pre@@ ci@@ ous , and ano@@ in@@ ted the feet of J@@ es@@ us , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir . the house was filled with the fra@@ gr@@ ance of the o@@ in@@ tment .
now he said this , not because he car@@ ed for the poor , but because he was a th@@ i@@ ef , and having the money box , used to ste@@ al what was put into it .
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for J@@ es@@ us ' sake only , but that they might see Lazar@@ us also , whom he had raised from the dead .
they took the branches of the pal@@ m trees , and went out to meet him , and cri@@ ed out , " Hos@@ anna ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel ! "
his dis@@ cip@@ les di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand these things at first , but when J@@ es@@ us was gl@@ ori@@ fied , then they remember@@ ed that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multi@@ tude therefore that was with him when he called Lazar@@ us out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testi@@ fying about it .
most certainly I tell you , unless a gra@@ in of wheat falls into the ear@@ th and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it be@@ ars much fruit .
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " Y@@ et a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that d@@ ark@@ ness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t over@@ take you . he who walk@@ s in the d@@ ark@@ ness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know where he is going .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " J@@ es@@ us said these things , and he depar@@ ted and hi@@ d himself from them .
if anyone list@@ ens to my say@@ ings , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe , I don '@@ t judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive my say@@ ings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the F@@ ather who sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over , J@@ es@@ us , kno@@ wing that his time had come that he would de@@ part from this world to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own who were in the world , he lov@@ ed them to the end .
then he p@@ oured water into the bas@@ in , and began to was@@ h the dis@@ cip@@ les ' feet , and to wi@@ pe them with the tow@@ el that was wrapped around him .
so when he had was@@ hed their feet , put his ou@@ ter gar@@ ment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " D@@ o you know what I have done to you ?
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
I don '@@ t speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the S@@ crip@@ ture may be fulfilled , ' He who e@@ ats bread with me has lifted up his he@@ el against me . '
J@@ es@@ us therefore answ@@ ered , " It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have di@@ pped it . " so when he had di@@ pped the piece of bread , he gave it to Ju@@ das , the son of Simon Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot .
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' W@@ here I am going , you can '@@ t come , ' so now I tell you .
a new comman@@ d@@ ment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have lov@@ ed you ; that you also love one another .
in my F@@ ather 's house are many homes . if it w@@ eren '@@ t so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
if you had known me , you would have known my F@@ ather also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
D@@ on '@@ t you believe that I am in the F@@ ather , and the F@@ ather in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the F@@ ather who lives in me does his works .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my F@@ ather .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the F@@ ather may be gl@@ ori@@ fied in the Son .
one who has my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keeps them , that person is one who lov@@ es me . one who lov@@ es me will be lov@@ ed by my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love me do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep my words . the word which you hear is@@ n '@@ t mine , but the F@@ ather 's who sent me .
but the coun@@ sel@@ or , the Holy Spiri@@ t , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he will te@@ ach you all things , and will remin@@ d you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . D@@ on '@@ t let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fear@@ ful .
you heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' if you lov@@ ed me , you would have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , because I said ' I am going to my F@@ ather ; ' for the F@@ ather is greater than I@@ .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can '@@ t bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the v@@ ine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the v@@ ine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same be@@ ars much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my F@@ ather gl@@ ori@@ fied , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my dis@@ cip@@ les .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the ser@@ vant do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what his lor@@ d does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my F@@ ather , I have made known to you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . ' if they persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don '@@ t know him who sent me .
if I h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t done among them the works which no one else did , they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have had sin . but now have they seen and also ha@@ ted both me and my F@@ ather .
" when the coun@@ sel@@ or has come , whom I will send to you from the F@@ ather , the Spiri@@ t of truth , who proceeds from the F@@ ather , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don '@@ t go away , the coun@@ sel@@ or won '@@ t come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
however when he , the Spiri@@ t of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he he@@ ars , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
therefore J@@ es@@ us perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " D@@ o you inqu@@ ire among yo@@ ur@@ selves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won '@@ t see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
most certainly I tell you , that you will we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world will re@@ jo@@ ice . you will be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row will be turned into joy .
a woman , when she gives birth , has sor@@ row , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remember the an@@ gu@@ ish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the F@@ ather in my name , he will give it to you .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you pla@@ in@@ ly about the F@@ ather .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don '@@ t say to you , that I will pra@@ y to the F@@ ather for you ,
I came out from the F@@ ather , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the F@@ ather . "
be@@ hold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be sc@@ at@@ tered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yo@@ urs , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy F@@ ather , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pra@@ y not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the ev@@ il one .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my gl@@ ory , which you have given me , for you lov@@ ed me before the foundation of the world .
when therefore he said to them , " I am he , " they went back@@ ward , and fell to the ground .
Simon Peter therefore , having a s@@ word , drew it , and struck the high pri@@ est 's ser@@ vant , and cut off his right e@@ ar . the ser@@ vant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to Peter , " P@@ ut the s@@ word into its she@@ ath . the c@@ up which the F@@ ather has given me , shall I not su@@ rely drink it ? "
and led him to Ann@@ as first , for he was father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , who was high pri@@ est that year .
Simon Peter followed J@@ es@@ us , as did another dis@@ cip@@ le . now that dis@@ cip@@ le was known to the high pri@@ est , and entered in with J@@ es@@ us into the court of the high pri@@ est ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other dis@@ cip@@ le , who was known to the high pri@@ est , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of co@@ als , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . be@@ hold , these know the things which I said . "
they led J@@ es@@ us therefore from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um . it was early , and they themselves di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um , that they might not be def@@ iled , but might eat the P@@ ass@@ over .
then P@@ il@@ ate went out again , and said to them , " be@@ hold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard these words , he brought J@@ es@@ us out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pav@@ ement , " but in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a . "
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Pla@@ ce of a s@@ kul@@ l , " which is called in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , "
P@@ il@@ ate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " J@@ es@@ us of NA@@ Z@@ AR@@ E@@ T@@ H , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where J@@ es@@ us was cru@@ ci@@ fied was near the city ; and it was written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , in Latin , and in Greek .
but there were standing by the cross of J@@ es@@ us his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of C@@ lop@@ as , and Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don '@@ t know where they have laid him ! "
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb we@@ eping . so , as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two an@@ gel@@ s in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of J@@ es@@ us had la@@ in .
when therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the dis@@ cip@@ les were assemb@@ led , for fear of the Jews , J@@ es@@ us came and stood in the mid@@ st , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the dis@@ cip@@ les therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
that dis@@ cip@@ le therefore whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed said to Peter , " It 's the Lord ! " so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his co@@ at around him ( for he was nak@@ ed ) , and threw himself into the sea .
but the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts away ) , dra@@ gging the net full of fish .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ three ; and even though there were so many , the net was@@ n '@@ t torn .
this is now the third time that J@@ es@@ us was revealed to his dis@@ cip@@ les , after he had risen from the dead .
most certainly I tell you , when you were young , you d@@ ressed yo@@ ur@@ self , and walked where you wanted to . but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will d@@ ress you , and carry you where you don '@@ t want to go . "
there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , which if they would all be written , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have room for the books that would be written .
being assemb@@ led together with them , he comman@@ ded them , " D@@ on '@@ t de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which you heard from me .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spiri@@ t has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jer@@ usalem , in all Ju@@ de@@ a and Samar@@ ia , and to the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th . "
when they had come in , they went up into the up@@ per room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , An@@ drew , Philip , Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ olome@@ w , Matthew , James the son of Alp@@ ha@@ e@@ us , Simon the Zeal@@ ot , and Ju@@ das the son of James .
all these with one accord continued stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation , along with the women , and Mary the mother of J@@ es@@ us , and with his brothers .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jer@@ usalem that in their language that field was called ' Ak@@ el@@ d@@ ama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spiri@@ t gave them the ability to speak .
yes , and on my servants and on my hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s in those days , I will p@@ our out my Spiri@@ t , and they will pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth , a man approved by God to you by m@@ igh@@ ty works and won@@ ders and signs which God did by him in the mid@@ st of you , even as you yo@@ ur@@ selves know ,
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
therefore , being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up the Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ,
being therefore ex@@ al@@ ted by the right hand of God , and having received from the F@@ ather the promise of the Holy Spiri@@ t , he has p@@ oured out this , which you now see and hear .
Peter said to them , " rep@@ ent , and be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , every one of you , in the name of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist for the for@@ gi@@ veness of sin@@ s , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spiri@@ t .
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
they recogn@@ ized him , that it was he who used to sit beg@@ ging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ autiful G@@ ate of the temp@@ le . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
as the la@@ me man who was he@@ aled held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly won@@ dering .
for Mos@@ es indeed said to the fa@@ thers , ' The Lord God will raise up a pro@@ phe@@ t for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
it will be , that every sou@@ l that will not listen to that pro@@ phe@@ t will be ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
you are the children of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which God made with our fa@@ thers , saying to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , ' In your se@@ ed will all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed . '
God , having raised up his ser@@ vant , J@@ es@@ us , sent him to you first , to b@@ less you , in turning away everyone of you from your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . "
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heav@@ en , the ear@@ th , the sea , and all that is in them ;
the kings of the ear@@ th take a stand , and the rul@@ ers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Ch@@ r@@ ist . '
when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and they spoke the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
but a certain man named An@@ an@@ ias , with Sap@@ ph@@ ira , his wife , sold a possession ,
by the hands of the A@@ post@@ les many signs and won@@ ders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's por@@ ch .
now when the high pri@@ est , the captain of the temp@@ le , and the chief pri@@ ests heard these words , they were very per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed about them and what might become of this .
we are H@@ is witnesses of these things ; and so also is the Holy Spiri@@ t , whom God has given to those who obe@@ y him . "
they agreed with him . summon@@ ing the A@@ post@@ les , they beat them and comman@@ ded them not to speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
but some of those who were of the syn@@ ago@@ gue called " The Liber@@ tin@@ es , " and of the Cy@@ ren@@ ians , of the Alexand@@ ri@@ ans , and of those of Cil@@ ic@@ ia and Asia ar@@ ose , disp@@ ut@@ ing with Stephen .
then he came out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and lived in Har@@ an . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
'@@ i will judge the nation to which they will be in bon@@ da@@ ge , ' said God , ' and after that will they come out , and serve me in this place . '
and they were brought back to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and laid in the tomb that Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought for a price in silver from the children of Ham@@ or of Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sir@@ s , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
I have su@@ rely seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this is that Mos@@ es , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a pro@@ phe@@ t for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds that will go before us , for as for this Mos@@ es , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
" our fa@@ thers had the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , even as he who spoke to Mos@@ es comman@@ ded him to make it according to the pat@@ tern that he had seen ;
but he , being full of the Holy Spiri@@ t , looked up stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly into heav@@ en , and saw the gl@@ ory of God , and J@@ es@@ us standing on the right hand of God ,
but they cri@@ ed out with a l@@ oud voice , and stopped their e@@ ars , and rushed at him with one accord .
Sa@@ ul was con@@ sent@@ ing to his death . a great persec@@ ution ar@@ ose against the assembly which was in Jer@@ usalem in that day . they were all sc@@ at@@ tered abroad throughout the regions of Ju@@ de@@ a and Samar@@ ia , except for the A@@ post@@ les .
the multi@@ tu@@ des list@@ ened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its came out of many of those who had them . they came out , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice . many who had been paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed and la@@ me were he@@ aled .
now when the A@@ post@@ les who were at Jer@@ usalem heard that Samar@@ ia had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and pre@@ ached the Go@@ od News to many villages of the Samar@@ it@@ ans .
he ar@@ ose and went ; and be@@ hold , there was a man of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , a e@@ un@@ u@@ ch of great authority under C@@ and@@ ace , qu@@ een of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jer@@ usalem to worship .
now the passage of the S@@ crip@@ ture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a she@@ ep to the sla@@ ughter . as a lam@@ b before his s@@ hear@@ er is silent , so he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh .
he comman@@ ded the char@@ i@@ ot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch , and he b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caught Philip away , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see him any more , for he went on his way re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
when Sa@@ ul had come to Jer@@ usalem , he tried to join himself to the dis@@ cip@@ les ; but they were all afraid of him , not believ@@ ing that he was a dis@@ cip@@ le .
pre@@ aching bol@@ dly in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us . he spoke and disputed against the Hel@@ len@@ ists , but they were seeking to kill him .
so the assemb@@ lies throughout all Ju@@ de@@ a and Gal@@ il@@ ee and Samar@@ ia had peace , and were built up . they were multi@@ p@@ lied , walk@@ ing in the fear of the Lord and in the comfor@@ t of the Holy Spiri@@ t .
it happened in those days that she fell si@@ ck , and died . when they had was@@ hed her , they laid her in an up@@ per room .
when the an@@ gel who spoke to him had depar@@ ted , Cor@@ neli@@ us called two of his household servants and a dev@@ out soldier of those who w@@ aited on him continu@@ ally .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the hous@@ et@@ op to pra@@ y at about noon .
now while Peter was very per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , be@@ hold , the men who were sent by Cor@@ neli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
when it happened that Peter entered , Cor@@ neli@@ us met him , fell down at his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
send therefore to J@@ op@@ pa , and sum@@ mon Simon , who is sur@@ named Peter . he lo@@ dges in the house of Simon a tan@@ ner , by the seaside . when he comes , he will speak to you . '
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jer@@ usalem ; whom they also killed , han@@ ging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and d@@ rank with him after he rose from the dead .
they of the circum@@ c@@ ision who believed were amaz@@ ed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spiri@@ t was also p@@ oured out on the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
when I had looked in@@ t@@ ently at it , I considered , and saw the four @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ oted animals of the ear@@ th , wild animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky .
they therefore who were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad by the op@@ pression that ar@@ ose about Stephen trav@@ eled as far as Pho@@ en@@ ic@@ ia , Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
the report concerning them came to the e@@ ars of the assembly which was in Jer@@ usalem . they sent out Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch ,
when he had arrested him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squ@@ ads of four soldiers each to guard him , inten@@ ding to bring him out to the people after the P@@ ass@@ over .
and he went out and followed him . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that what was being done by the an@@ gel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Her@@ od had sought for him , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him , he examined the guards , and comman@@ ded that they should be put to death . he went down from Ju@@ de@@ a to Ca@@ es@@ area , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Her@@ od d@@ ressed himself in royal clo@@ thing , sat on the th@@ r@@ one , and gave a speech to them .
now in the assembly that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch there were some pro@@ ph@@ ets and teachers : Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , Simeon who was called N@@ ig@@ er , Lu@@ ci@@ us of Cy@@ ren@@ e , Man@@ a@@ en the foster brother of Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Sa@@ ul .
but they , passing on from Per@@ ga , came to Anti@@ o@@ ch of P@@ is@@ idi@@ a . they went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , and sat down .
as John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you sup@@ pose that I am ? I am not he . but be@@ hold , one comes after me the sand@@ als of whose feet I am not wor@@ thy to un@@ tie . '
for those who d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem , and their rul@@ ers , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know him , nor the voices of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which are read every Sab@@ b@@ ath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the hol@@ y and sure b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of David . '
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , they were filled with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , and contra@@ dic@@ ted the things which were spoken by Paul , and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med .
for so has the Lord comman@@ ded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that you should bring sal@@ vation to the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th . ' "
at Ly@@ str@@ a a certain man sat , im@@ po@@ tent in his feet , a crip@@ ple from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , who never had walked .
when the multi@@ tude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Ly@@ ca@@ on@@ ia , " The go@@ ds have come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men ! "
the pri@@ est of J@@ up@@ iter , whose temp@@ le was in front of their city , brought ox@@ en and gar@@ lands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multi@@ tu@@ des .
but when the A@@ post@@ les , Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Paul , heard of it , they t@@ ore their clo@@ th@@ es , and sp@@ ran@@ g into the multi@@ tude , cr@@ ying out ,
but as the dis@@ cip@@ les stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to Der@@ be .
when they had appointed el@@ ders for them in every assembly , and had pray@@ ed with fas@@ ting , they commen@@ ded them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
therefore when Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as had no small dis@@ cor@@ d and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and some others of them , to go up to Jer@@ usalem to the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders about this question .
when they had come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received by the assembly and the A@@ post@@ les and the el@@ ders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why do you temp@@ t God , that you should put a yok@@ e on the nec@@ k of the dis@@ cip@@ les which neither our fa@@ thers nor we were able to bear ?
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , un@@ settling your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , ' You must be circum@@ c@@ ised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no comman@@ d@@ ment ;
after some days Paul said to Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
but Paul di@@ d@@ n '@@ t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go with them to do the work .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decre@@ es to them to keep which had been or@@ da@@ ined by the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders who were at Jer@@ usalem .
on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day we went forth outside of the city by a ri@@ versi@@ de , where we supposed there was a place of pray@@ er , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
but when her mas@@ ters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Sil@@ as , and dra@@ gged them into the market@@ place before the rul@@ ers .
the j@@ a@@ iler , being ro@@ used out of sle@@ ep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his s@@ word and was about to kill himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had escaped .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
now these were more no@@ ble than those in Thessalon@@ ica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , exam@@ ining the S@@ crip@@ tures daily to see whether these things were so .
but when the Jews of Thessalon@@ ica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Ber@@ o@@ ea also , they came there likewise , ag@@ it@@ ating the multi@@ tu@@ des .
now all the Ath@@ en@@ ians and the st@@ ran@@ gers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignor@@ ance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to d@@ well on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , having determined appointed se@@ as@@ ons , and the boundaries of their d@@ wel@@ lings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by the man whom he has or@@ da@@ ined ; of which he has given assur@@ ance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
he depar@@ ted there , and went into the house of a certain man named J@@ ust@@ us , one who wor@@ shi@@ ped God , whose house was next door to the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
Cris@@ p@@ us , the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Cor@@ in@@ th@@ ians , when they heard , believed and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
then all the Greeks laid hold on S@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gal@@ li@@ o di@@ d@@ n '@@ t care about any of these things .
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jer@@ usalem , but I will return again to you if God Wil@@ ls , " he set sa@@ il from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
this man had been instruc@@ ted in the way of the Lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in spirit , he spoke and ta@@ ught accur@@ ately the things concerning J@@ es@@ us , although he knew only the b@@ ap@@ tism of John .
he began to speak bol@@ dly in the syn@@ ago@@ gue . but when P@@ ris@@ cil@@ la and A@@ qu@@ ila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accur@@ ately .
many of those who prac@@ ticed mag@@ ical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , to go to Jer@@ usalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
the whole city was filled with conf@@ usion , and they rushed with one accord into the the@@ ater , having seized G@@ ai@@ us and Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , men of Macedonia , Paul 's compan@@ ions in travel .
some therefore cri@@ ed one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in conf@@ usion . most of them di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know why they had come together .
if therefore Demetri@@ us and the craf@@ ts@@ men who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are pro@@ consul@@ s . let them press charges against one another .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be able to give an account of this commo@@ tion . "
on the first day of the week , when the dis@@ cip@@ les were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , inten@@ ding to de@@ part on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us sat in the window , weighed down with deep sle@@ ep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sle@@ ep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and e@@ aten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he depar@@ ted .
sa@@ iling from there , we came the following day opposite Chi@@ os . the next day we touched at Sam@@ os and stayed at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um , and the day after we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was has@@ tening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jer@@ usalem on the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
" now , be@@ hold , I know that you all , among whom I went about pre@@ aching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
when it happened that we had par@@ ted from them and had set sa@@ il , we came with a stra@@ ight course to C@@ os , and the next day to R@@ ho@@ des , and from there to Pat@@ ara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sa@@ iled to Syria , and lan@@ ded at T@@ y@@ re , for there the ship was to un@@ load her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's compan@@ ions , depar@@ ted , and came to Ca@@ es@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
they , when they heard it , gl@@ ori@@ fied God . they said to him , " You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed , and they are all z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for the law .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temp@@ le , s@@ tir@@ red up all the multi@@ tude and laid hands on him ,
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the comman@@ ding officer of the reg@@ im@@ ent that all Jer@@ usalem was in an u@@ pro@@ ar .
some sh@@ ou@@ ted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t find out the truth because of the no@@ ise , he comman@@ ded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the st@@ airs , bec@@ kon@@ ed with his hand to the people . when there was a great sil@@ ence , he spoke to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w language , saying ,
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Dam@@ as@@ cus , about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from the sky a great light around me .
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see for the gl@@ ory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing to his death , and guar@@ ding the clo@@ aks of those who killed him . '
they list@@ ened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " R@@ id the ear@@ th of this fellow , for he is@@ n '@@ t fit to live ! "
immediately those who were about to examine him depar@@ ted from him , and the comman@@ ding officer also was afraid when he real@@ ized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
when a great argument ar@@ ose , the comman@@ ding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so he took him , and brought him to the comman@@ ding officer , and said , " Paul , the prison@@ er , summon@@ ed me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and res@@ cu@@ ed him , having learned that he was a Roman .
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his acc@@ users also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
he even tried to prof@@ ane the temp@@ le , and we arrested him .
he ordered the centur@@ ion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to for@@ bid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
as he reas@@ oned about righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , self @@@ -@@ @ control , and the judgment to come , F@@ eli@@ x was ter@@ ri@@ fied , and answ@@ ered , " G@@ o your way for this time , and when it is conven@@ i@@ ent for me , I will sum@@ mon you . "
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Ca@@ es@@ area , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jer@@ usalem stood around him , bringing against him many and gri@@ ev@@ ous charges which they could not prove ,
but F@@ es@@ tus , desi@@ ring to gain fav@@ or with the Jews , answ@@ ered Paul and said , " Ar@@ e you willing to go up to Jer@@ usalem , and be jud@@ ged by me there concerning these things ? "
when therefore they had come together here , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded the man to be brought .
so on the next day , when Agri@@ p@@ pa and Bern@@ ice had come with great pom@@ p , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the comman@@ ding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of F@@ es@@ tus , Paul was brought in .
this I also did in Jer@@ usalem . I both shut up many of the sa@@ ints in prisons , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
when we had all fallen to the ear@@ th , I heard a voice saying to me in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w language , ' Sa@@ ul , Sa@@ ul , why are you persec@@ ut@@ ing me ? it is hard for you to kick against the go@@ ads . '
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a ser@@ vant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
but declared first to them of Dam@@ as@@ cus , at Jer@@ usalem , and throughout all the country of Ju@@ de@@ a , and also to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that they should rep@@ ent and turn to God , doing works wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance .
embar@@ king in a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , which was about to sa@@ il to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
when we had sa@@ iled across the sea which is off Cil@@ ic@@ ia and P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , we came to My@@ ra , a city of Ly@@ cia .
when we had sa@@ iled slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite C@@ ni@@ du@@ s , the wind not allowing us further , we sa@@ iled under the Le@@ e of Cre@@ te , opposite Sal@@ m@@ one .
but the centur@@ ion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the ship was caught , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
after they had ho@@ isted it up , they used cab@@ les to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run ag@@ round on the Sy@@ r@@ tis s@@ and bars , they lowered the sea an@@ ch@@ or , and so were driven along .
when neither sun nor stars sh@@ one on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be sav@@ ed was now taken away .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " Sir@@ s , you should have list@@ ened to me , and not have set sa@@ il from Cre@@ te , and have gotten this injur@@ y and loss .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sa@@ il@@ ors sur@@ mis@@ ed that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sa@@ il@@ ors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pre@@ ten@@ ding that they would lay out an@@ ch@@ ors from the bo@@ w ,
when he had said this , and had taken bread , he gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it , and began to eat .
when it was day , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the an@@ ch@@ ors , they left them in the sea , at the same time un@@ t@@ ying the ru@@ d@@ der ro@@ pes . Ho@@ isting up the fore@@ sa@@ il to the wind , they made for the beach .
the nati@@ ves showed us un@@ common kin@@ d@@ ness ; for they kin@@ d@@ led a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bun@@ dle of sti@@ cks and laid them on the fire , a vi@@ per came out because of the heat , and fas@@ tened on his hand .
when the nati@@ ves saw the cre@@ ature han@@ ging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a mur@@ der@@ er , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cu@@ red .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Ap@@ pi@@ us and The Th@@ ree ta@@ ver@@ ns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guar@@ ded him .
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sec@@ t , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t agree among themselves , they depar@@ ted after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spiri@@ t spoke righ@@ tly through I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , the pro@@ phe@@ t , to our fa@@ thers ,
saying , ' G@@ o to this people , and say , in hearing , you will hear , but will in no way understand . in seeing , you will see , but will in no way perce@@ ive .
for this people 's heart has grown cal@@ l@@ ous . their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing . their eyes they have closed . L@@ est they should see with their eyes , hear with their e@@ ars , understand with their heart , and would turn again , and I would he@@ al them . '
for I long to see you , that I may im@@ part to you some spir@@ itual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yo@@ urs and mine .
so , as much as is in me , I am e@@ ager to pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News to you also who are in Rome .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , for it is the power of God for sal@@ vation for everyone who believes ; for the J@@ ew first , and also for the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his ever@@ lasting power and di@@ vin@@ ity ; that they may be without exc@@ use .
and tra@@ ded the gl@@ ory of the incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble God for the lik@@ eness of an image of cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble man , and of birds , and four @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ oted animals , and cre@@ eping things .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not f@@ it@@ ting ;
back@@ bi@@ ters , ha@@ te@@ ful to God , in@@ sol@@ ent , ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , bo@@ ast@@ ful , invent@@ ors of ev@@ il things , dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to parents ,
who , kno@@ wing the ordin@@ ance of God , that those who practice such things are wor@@ thy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
but according to your hard@@ ness and un@@ rep@@ ent@@ ant heart you are treas@@ uring up for yo@@ ur@@ self wr@@ ath in the day of wr@@ ath , reve@@ lation , and of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @@@ -@@ @ seeking , and don '@@ t obe@@ y the truth , but obe@@ y un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , will be wr@@ ath and in@@ dign@@ ation ,
for as many as have sin@@ ned without law will also per@@ ish without the law . as many as have sin@@ ned under the law will be jud@@ ged by the law .
for it is@@ n '@@ t the hear@@ ers of the law who are righ@@ te@@ ous before God , but the do@@ ers of the law will be justified
( for when Gen@@ ti@@ les who don '@@ t have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
you therefore who te@@ ach another , don '@@ t you te@@ ach yo@@ ur@@ self ? you who pre@@ ach that a man sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t ste@@ al , do you ste@@ al ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a li@@ ar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prev@@ ail when you come into judgment . "
why not ( as we are s@@ lan@@ der@@ ously reported , and as some af@@ firm that we say ) , " Let us do ev@@ il , that good may come ? " those who say so are j@@ ust@@ ly condemned .
they have all turned aside . they have together become un@@ profitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every m@@ outh may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he received the sign of circum@@ c@@ ision , a se@@ al of the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the faith which he had while he was in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they might be in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness might also be accounted to them .
he is the father of circum@@ c@@ ision to those who not only are of the circum@@ c@@ ision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which he had in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision .
for the promise to Ab@@ ra@@ ham and to his se@@ ed that he should be he@@ ir of the world was@@ n '@@ t through the law , but through the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of faith .
who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " S@@ o will your se@@ ed be . "
without being weak@@ ened in faith , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ ah 's w@@ om@@ b .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t w@@ av@@ er through un@@ belief , but grew strong through faith , giving gl@@ ory to God ,
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we re@@ jo@@ ice in hope of the gl@@ ory of God .
and hope do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dis@@ appoint us , because God 's love has been p@@ oured out into our hear@@ ts through the Holy Spiri@@ t who was given to us .
for if , while we were enem@@ ies , we were reconc@@ iled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconc@@ iled , we will be sav@@ ed by his life .
we were buried therefore with him through b@@ ap@@ tism to death , that just like Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised from the dead through the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , so we also might walk in new@@ ness of life .
kno@@ wing this , that our old man was cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bon@@ da@@ ge to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bon@@ d@@ servants of sin , you became obe@@ di@@ ent from the heart to that form of teaching where@@ un@@ to you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now as@@ ha@@ med ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanc@@ ti@@ fication , and the result of eter@@ nal life .
or don '@@ t you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has domin@@ ion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is dis@@ charged from the law of the husband .
for I don '@@ t know what I am doing . for I don '@@ t practice what I desire to do ; but what I h@@ ate , that I do .
for I know that in me , that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , d@@ wel@@ ls no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don '@@ t find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don '@@ t do ; but the ev@@ il which I don '@@ t desire , that I practice .
but if what I don '@@ t desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which d@@ wel@@ ls in me .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to those who are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who don '@@ t walk according to the f@@ les@@ h , but according to the Spiri@@ t .
for what the law co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t do , in that it was weak through the f@@ les@@ h , God did , sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of s@@ inf@@ ul f@@ les@@ h and for sin , he condemned sin in the f@@ les@@ h ;
for those who live according to the f@@ les@@ h set their min@@ ds on the things of the f@@ les@@ h , but those who live according to the Spiri@@ t , the things of the Spiri@@ t .
because the mind of the f@@ les@@ h is hos@@ tile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the f@@ les@@ h but in the Spiri@@ t , if it is so that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ wel@@ ls in you . but if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is not his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him who raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ wel@@ ls in you , he who raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us from the dead will also give life to your mort@@ al bodies through his Spiri@@ t who d@@ wel@@ ls in you .
for if you live after the f@@ les@@ h , you must die ; but if by the Spiri@@ t you put to death the de@@ eds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spiri@@ t of God , these are children of God .
for I consider that the suffer@@ ings of this present time are not wor@@ thy to be compared with the gl@@ ory which will be revealed toward us .
but if we hope for that which we don '@@ t see , we wait for it with patience .
in the same way , the Spiri@@ t also helps our weaknesses , for we don '@@ t know how to pra@@ y as we ought . but the Spiri@@ t himself makes inter@@ c@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can '@@ t be ut@@ tered .
whom he pre@@ dest@@ ined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
who is he who condem@@ ns ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist who died , yes rather , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who also makes inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
for he said to Mos@@ es , " I will have mer@@ cy on whom I have mer@@ cy , and I will have comp@@ as@@ sion on whom I have comp@@ as@@ sion . "
for the S@@ crip@@ ture says to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the ear@@ th . "
as he says also in Hos@@ ea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' bel@@ ov@@ ed , ' who was not bel@@ ov@@ ed . "
" it will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the ear@@ th . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gen@@ ti@@ les , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , at@@ tained to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , even the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness which is of faith ;
for being ignor@@ ant of God 's righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and seeking to establish their own righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t subject themselves to the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God .
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your m@@ outh , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we pre@@ ach :
that if you will conf@@ ess with your m@@ outh that J@@ es@@ us is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be sav@@ ed .
for there is no distinc@@ tion between J@@ ew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a pre@@ acher ?
and how will they pre@@ ach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News of peace , who bring glad ti@@ dings of good things ! "
but I ask , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t Israel know ? first Mos@@ es says , " I will prov@@ oke you to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is no nation , with a nation vo@@ id of understanding I will make you angry . "
I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah is very b@@ old , and says , " I was found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me . I was revealed to those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask for me . "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were har@@ dened .
if by any means I may prov@@ oke to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y those who are my f@@ les@@ h , and may save some of them .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were graf@@ ted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be graf@@ ted into their own olive tree ?
and so all Israel will be sav@@ ed . even as it is written , " There will come out of Z@@ ion the D@@ eli@@ ver@@ er , and he will turn away un@@ go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess from Jac@@ o@@ b .
D@@ on '@@ t be con@@ formed to this world , but be transformed by the rene@@ wing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @@@ -@@ @ ple@@ asing , and perfect will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . D@@ on '@@ t set your mind on high things , but associate with the hum@@ ble . D@@ on '@@ t be wise in your own conce@@ its .
therefore " If your enemy is hun@@ gry , fe@@ ed him . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head . "
for rul@@ ers are not a terror to the good work , but to the ev@@ il . do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
the night is far gone , and the day is near . let 's therefore throw off the works of d@@ ark@@ ness , and let 's put on the arm@@ or of light .
D@@ on '@@ t let him who e@@ ats desp@@ ise him who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat . D@@ on '@@ t let him who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat judge him who e@@ ats , for God has accepted him .
he who obser@@ ves the day , obser@@ ves it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who e@@ ats , e@@ ats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , to the Lord he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , and gives God thanks .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Ch@@ r@@ ist died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you desp@@ ise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
D@@ on '@@ t overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is ev@@ il for that man who creates a stumbling block by e@@ ating .
it is good to not eat meat , drink wine , nor do anything by which your brother stumb@@ les , is off@@ ended , or is made weak .
but I write the more bol@@ dly to you in part , as remin@@ ding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
yes , making it my aim to pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , not where Ch@@ r@@ ist was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
but , as it is written , " They will see , to whom no news of him came . they who ha@@ ven '@@ t heard will understand . "
yes , it has been their good pleas@@ ure , and they are their deb@@ tors . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , they o@@ we it to them also to serve them in fle@@ sh@@ ly things .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the ful@@ l@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , by our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and by the love of the Spiri@@ t , that you strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent in Ju@@ de@@ a , and that my service which I have for Jer@@ usalem may be acceptable to the sa@@ ints ;
I commen@@ d to you Pho@@ ebe , our sister , who is a ser@@ vant of the assembly that is at Cen@@ ch@@ re@@ a@@ e ,
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way wor@@ thy of the sa@@ ints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she her@@ self also has been a hel@@ per of many , and of my own self .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doc@@ tr@@ ine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don '@@ t serve our Lord , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but their own bel@@ ly ; and by their smooth and f@@ lat@@ tering speech , they dec@@ e@@ ive the hear@@ ts of the innocent .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence has become known to all . I re@@ jo@@ ice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is ev@@ il .
God is fa@@ ith@@ ful , through whom you were called into the fel@@ low@@ ship of his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , our Lord .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perf@@ ected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Ch@@ lo@@ e 's household , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for the word of the cross is fo@@ ol@@ ishness to those who are dying , but to us who are sav@@ ed it is the power of God .
for seeing that in the wis@@ dom of God , the world through its wis@@ dom di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know God , it was God 's good pleas@@ ure through the fo@@ ol@@ ishness of the pre@@ aching to save those who believe .
but God chose the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world that he might put to sh@@ ame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to sh@@ ame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the low@@ ly things of the world , and the things that are desp@@ ised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
we speak wis@@ dom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wis@@ dom not of this world , nor of the rul@@ ers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
but as it is written , " Th@@ ings which an eye di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see , and an e@@ ar di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear , which di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into the heart of man , these God has prepared for those who love him . "
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spiri@@ t .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spiri@@ t which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
now the natural man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive the things of God 's Spiri@@ t , for they are fo@@ ol@@ ishness to him , and he can '@@ t know them , because they are spir@@ itu@@ ally dis@@ cer@@ ned .
for you are still fle@@ sh@@ ly . for in@@ so@@ far as there is je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , stri@@ fe , and factions among you , ar@@ en '@@ t you fle@@ sh@@ ly , and don '@@ t you walk in the ways of men ?
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own la@@ bor .
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master buil@@ der I laid a foundation , and another buil@@ ds on it . but let each man be careful how he buil@@ ds on it .
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
whether Paul , or A@@ pol@@ los , or C@@ ep@@ has , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yo@@ urs ,
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you bo@@ ast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord is willing . and I will know , not the word of those who are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , but the power .
it is actually reported that there is sexual im@@ mor@@ ality among you , and such sexual im@@ mor@@ ality as is not even named among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that one has his father 's wife .
pur@@ ge out the old ye@@ ast , that you may be a new lum@@ p , even as you are un@@ le@@ av@@ ened . for indeed Ch@@ r@@ ist , our P@@ ass@@ over , has been sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old ye@@ ast , neither with the ye@@ ast of mal@@ ice and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , but with the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of sinc@@ erity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sin@@ ners of this world , or with the c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous and ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , or with i@@ do@@ la@@ ters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that the sa@@ ints will judge the world ? and if the world is jud@@ ged by you , are you un@@ wor@@ thy to judge the smal@@ lest matters ?
if then , you have to judge things per@@ taining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
such were some of you , but you were was@@ hed . but you were sanc@@ ti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and in the Spiri@@ t of our God .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that your bodies are members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them members of a pro@@ stitute ? May it never be !
or don '@@ t you know that he who is joined to a pro@@ stitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one f@@ les@@ h . "
or don '@@ t you know that your body is a temp@@ le of the Holy Spiri@@ t which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
but , because of sexual im@@ mor@@ alities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
let the husband ren@@ der to his wife the aff@@ ection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over his own body , but the wife .
D@@ on '@@ t de@@ pri@@ ve one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er , and may be together again , that S@@ atan do@@ es@@ n '@@ t temp@@ t you because of your lack of self @@@ -@@ @ control .
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconc@@ iled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
yet if the un@@ beli@@ ever de@@ parts , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bon@@ da@@ ge in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
were you called being a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ? D@@ on '@@ t let that bo@@ ther you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the dist@@ ress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? D@@ on '@@ t seek to be fre@@ ed . are you free from a wife ? D@@ on '@@ t seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from car@@ es . he who is un@@ married is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may ple@@ ase the Lord ;
so then both he who gives his own vir@@ gin in marriage does well , and he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to who@@ mev@@ er she desi@@ res , only in the Lord .
but food will not commen@@ d us to God . for neither , if we don '@@ t eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
if to others I am not an A@@ pos@@ tle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the se@@ al of my ap@@ ost@@ le@@ ship in the Lord .
have we no right to take along a wife who is a beli@@ ever , even as the rest of the A@@ post@@ les , and the brothers of the Lord , and C@@ ep@@ has ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a v@@ ine@@ yard , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat of its fruit ? or who fe@@ eds a flock , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t drink from the flock 's milk ?
D@@ on '@@ t you know that those who serve around sac@@ red things eat from the things of the temp@@ le , and those who wait on the alt@@ ar have their portion with the alt@@ ar ?
but I have used none of these things , and I don '@@ t write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my bo@@ asting vo@@ id .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship entr@@ usted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , I may present the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Go@@ od News .
to the Jews I became as a J@@ ew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
now I do this for the sake of the Go@@ od News , that I may be a joint par@@ tak@@ er of it .
but I beat my body and bring it into sub@@ mission , lest by any means , after I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignor@@ ant , brothers , that our fa@@ thers were all under the cl@@ oud , and all passed through the sea ;
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
but I say that the things which the Gen@@ ti@@ les sacrifice , they sacrifice to dem@@ ons , and not to God , and I don '@@ t desire that you would have fel@@ low@@ ship with dem@@ ons .
you can '@@ t both drink the c@@ up of the Lord and the c@@ up of dem@@ ons . you can '@@ t both par@@ take of the table of the Lord , and of the table of dem@@ ons .
but if one of those who don '@@ t believe invi@@ tes you to a me@@ al , and you are inc@@ lined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of con@@ science .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to id@@ ols , " don '@@ t eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of con@@ science . for " the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and all its ful@@ l@@ ness . "
even as I also ple@@ ase all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be sav@@ ed .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Ch@@ r@@ ist , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Ch@@ r@@ ist is God .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shor@@ n . but if it is sha@@ me@@ ful for a woman to be shor@@ n or sha@@ ved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and gl@@ ory of God , but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
but in giving you this command , I don '@@ t praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
when therefore you assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves together , it is not the Lord 's Sup@@ per that you eat .
in the same way he also took the c@@ up , after Sup@@ per , saying , " This c@@ up is the new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the c@@ up .
for he who e@@ ats and drin@@ ks in an un@@ wor@@ thy way e@@ ats and drin@@ ks judgment to himself , if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dis@@ cer@@ n the Lord 's body .
but when we are jud@@ ged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
but if anyone is hun@@ gry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order wh@@ en@@ ever I come .
if the fo@@ ot would say , " Bec@@ ause I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the e@@ ar would say , " Bec@@ ause I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
those parts of the body which we think to be less hon@@ or@@ able , on those we bes@@ to@@ w more ab@@ und@@ ant hon@@ or ; and our un@@ present@@ able parts have more ab@@ und@@ ant pro@@ pri@@ ety ;
if I have the gift of pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and know all my@@ ster@@ ies and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don '@@ t have love , I am nothing .
if I dol@@ e out all my goods to fe@@ ed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don '@@ t have love , it profits me nothing .
love never fails . but where there are pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will ce@@ ase . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y . for he is greater who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interpre@@ ts , that the assembly may be built up .
but now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with other languages , what would I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of reve@@ lation , or of knowledge , or of pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying , or of teaching ?
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pip@@ e or har@@ p , if they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t give a distinc@@ tion in the so@@ unds , how would it be known what is pip@@ ed or har@@ ped ?
so also you , unless you ut@@ tered by the ton@@ gue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of so@@ unds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
if then I don '@@ t know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreig@@ ner , and he who speaks would be a foreig@@ ner to me .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
otherwise if you b@@ less with the spirit , how will he who fil@@ ls the place of the un@@ learned say the " A@@ men " at your giving of thanks , seeing he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what you say ?
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruc@@ t others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the un@@ believ@@ ing ; but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying is for a sign , not to the un@@ believ@@ ing , but to those who believe .
let your wi@@ ves keep silent in the assemb@@ lies , for it has not been per@@ mitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subj@@ ection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own hus@@ bands at home , for it is sha@@ me@@ ful for a woman to ch@@ at@@ ter in the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him recogn@@ ize the things which I write to you , that they are the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Go@@ od News which I pre@@ ached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
for I am the least of the A@@ post@@ les , who is not wor@@ thy to be called an A@@ pos@@ tle , because I persec@@ uted the assembly of God .
now if Ch@@ r@@ ist is pre@@ ached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead ?
if Ch@@ r@@ ist has not been raised , then our pre@@ aching is in v@@ ain , and your faith also is in v@@ ain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist , whom he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
that which you so@@ w , you don '@@ t so@@ w the body that will be , but a b@@ are gra@@ in , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each se@@ ed a body of its own .
there is one gl@@ ory of the sun , another gl@@ ory of the moon , and another gl@@ ory of the stars ; for one star di@@ ffers from another star in gl@@ ory .
as is the one made of d@@ ust , such are those who are also made of d@@ ust ; and as is the heav@@ en@@ ly , such are they also that are heav@@ en@@ ly .
therefore let no one desp@@ ise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now concerning A@@ pol@@ los , the brother , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not at all his desire to come now ; but he will come when he has an opportunity .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us through the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints who are in the whole of A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ ts us in all our aff@@ li@@ ction , that we may be able to comfor@@ t those who are in any aff@@ li@@ ction , through the comfor@@ t with which we ourselves are comfor@@ ted by God .
but if we are aff@@ lic@@ ted , it is for your comfor@@ t and sal@@ vation . if we are comfor@@ ted , it is for your comfor@@ t , which produces in you the patient en@@ during of the same suffer@@ ings which we also suffer .
for our bo@@ asting is this : the testimony of our con@@ science , that in hol@@ iness and sinc@@ erity of God , not in fle@@ sh@@ ly wis@@ dom but in the grace of God we beha@@ ved ourselves in the world , and more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly toward you .
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
for out of much aff@@ li@@ ction and an@@ gu@@ ish of heart I wrote to you with many te@@ ars , not that you should be made sor@@ ry , but that you might know the love that I have so ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly for you .
but if any has caused sor@@ row , he has caused sor@@ row , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
so that on the contrary you should rather for@@ give him and comfor@@ t him , lest by any means such a one should be sw@@ allowed up with his excessive sor@@ row .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obe@@ di@@ ent in all things .
being revealed that you are a letter of Ch@@ r@@ ist , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tab@@ lets of stone , but in tab@@ lets that are hear@@ ts of f@@ les@@ h .
for most certainly that which has been made g@@ lor@@ ious has not been made g@@ lor@@ ious in this respect , by reason of the gl@@ ory that sur@@ passes .
and not as Mos@@ es , who put a ve@@ il on his face , that the children of Israel wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t look stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly on the end of that which was passing away .
but we have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of sh@@ ame , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by the manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
in whom the go@@ d of this world has b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of the un@@ believ@@ ing , that the light of the Go@@ od News of the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should not da@@ wn on them .
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that the life of J@@ es@@ us may also be revealed in our body .
while we don '@@ t look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al , but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for most certainly in this we gro@@ an , lon@@ ging to be clo@@ th@@ ed with our habi@@ tation which is from heav@@ en ;
for indeed we who are in this tent do gro@@ an , being burdened ; not that we desire to be un@@ clo@@ th@@ ed , but that we desire to be clo@@ th@@ ed , that what is mort@@ al may be sw@@ allowed up by life .
we are cour@@ age@@ ous , I say , and are willing rather to be ab@@ sent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for we are not commen@@ ding ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of bo@@ asting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who bo@@ ast in appearance , and not in heart .
therefore if anyone is in Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . be@@ hold , all things have become new .
name@@ ly , that God was in Ch@@ r@@ ist reconc@@ iling the world to himself , not rec@@ kon@@ ing to them their t@@ res@@ passes , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Ch@@ r@@ ist , as though God were ent@@ re@@ ating by us : we be@@ g you on behalf of Ch@@ r@@ ist , be reconc@@ iled to God .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I list@@ ened to you , in a day of sal@@ vation I helped you . " be@@ hold , now is the acceptable time . be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation .
great is my bol@@ d@@ ness of speech toward you . great is my bo@@ asting on your behalf . I am filled with comfor@@ t . I over@@ flow with joy in all our aff@@ li@@ ction .
for even when we had come into Macedonia , our f@@ les@@ h had no relief , but we were aff@@ lic@@ ted on every side . F@@ ight@@ ings were outside . fear was inside .
so although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your ear@@ n@@ est care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
for if in anything I have bo@@ asted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our g@@ lor@@ ying also which I made before Tit@@ us was found to be truth .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
for you know the grace of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that , though he was rich , yet for your sak@@ es he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedi@@ ent for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved ear@@ n@@ est in many things , but now much more ear@@ n@@ est , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
as for Tit@@ us , he is my partner and fellow worker for you . as for our brothers , they are the A@@ post@@ les of the assemb@@ lies , the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but I have sent the brothers that our bo@@ asting on your behalf may not be in v@@ ain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won '@@ t by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you un@@ prepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident bo@@ asting .
now may he who supplies se@@ ed to the so@@ wer and bread for food , supply and multi@@ ply your se@@ ed for so@@ wing , and increase the fru@@ its of your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the sa@@ ints , but ab@@ oun@@ ds also through many gi@@ v@@ ings of thanks to God ;
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they g@@ lor@@ ify God for the obe@@ di@@ ence of your conf@@ ession to the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and for the liber@@ ality of your contribution to them and to all ;
while they themselves also , with supp@@ lic@@ ation on your behalf , ye@@ ar@@ n for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone tru@@ sts in himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , so also we are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such are we also in de@@ ed when we are present .
for we are not b@@ old to number or compar@@ e ourselves with some of those who commen@@ d themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
not bo@@ asting beyond proper limits in other men 's la@@ b@@ ors , but having hope that as your faith gro@@ ws , we will be ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly en@@ lar@@ ged by you in our sp@@ here of influence ,
or did I commit a sin in hum@@ b@@ ling myself that you might be ex@@ al@@ ted , because I pre@@ ached to you God 's Go@@ od News free of charge ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they bo@@ ast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if he dev@@ ours you , if he takes you cap@@ tive , if he ex@@ al@@ ts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
I have been in travels often , per@@ ils of rivers , per@@ ils of rob@@ bers , per@@ ils from my country@@ men , per@@ ils from the Gen@@ ti@@ les , per@@ ils in the city , per@@ ils in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , per@@ ils in the sea , per@@ ils among false brothers ;
for if I would desire to bo@@ ast , I will not be fo@@ ol@@ ish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or he@@ ars from me .
by reason of the exceeding gre@@ at@@ ness of the reve@@ lations , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , a mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to tor@@ ment me , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively .
he has said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weak@@ ness . " most gla@@ dly therefore I will rather gl@@ ory in my weaknesses , that the power of Ch@@ r@@ ist may rest on me .
for what is there in which you were made in@@ fer@@ ior to the rest of the assemb@@ lies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
for he was cru@@ ci@@ fied through weak@@ ness , yet he lives through the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we will live with him through the power of God toward you .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don '@@ t you know as to your own selves , that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you ? -@@ -@@ unless indeed you are dis@@ qualified .
for this cause I write these things while ab@@ sent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for te@@ aring down .
I mar@@ v@@ el that you are so quickly de@@ ser@@ ting him who called you in the grace of Ch@@ r@@ ist to a different " good news " ;
and there is@@ n '@@ t another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to per@@ ver@@ t the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but even though we , or an an@@ gel from heav@@ en , should pre@@ ach to you any " good news " other than that which we pre@@ ached to you , let him be Cur@@ sed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man pre@@ aches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cur@@ sed .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Go@@ od News which was pre@@ ached by me , that it is not according to man .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persec@@ uted the assembly of God , and rav@@ aged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my country@@ men , being more exce@@ ed@@ ingly z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for the traditions of my fa@@ thers .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subj@@ ection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Go@@ od News might continue with you .
but from those who were re@@ pu@@ ted to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t show parti@@ ality to man ) -@@ -@@ they , I say , who were respected im@@ par@@ ted nothing to me ,
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entr@@ usted with the Go@@ od News for the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , even as Peter with the Go@@ od News for the circum@@ c@@ ision
but if , while we sought to be justified in Ch@@ r@@ ist , we ourselves also were found sin@@ ners , is Ch@@ r@@ ist a ser@@ vant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @@@ -@@ @ bre@@ aker .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a cur@@ se . for it is written , " Cur@@ sed is everyone who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
now I say this . a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant confirmed be@@ fore@@ hand by God in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness would have been of the law .
so that the law has become our tut@@ or to bring us to Ch@@ r@@ ist , that we might be justified by faith .
but I say that so long as the he@@ ir is a child , he is no different from a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant , though he is lor@@ d of all ;
what was the b@@ les@@ sing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have p@@ lu@@ cked out your eyes and given them to me .
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed about you .
however , the son by the hand@@ ma@@ id was born according to the f@@ les@@ h , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troub@@ les you will bear his judgment , who@@ ever he is .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don '@@ t use your freedom for gain to the f@@ les@@ h , but through love be servants to one another .
for the f@@ les@@ h lu@@ sts against the Spiri@@ t , and the Spiri@@ t against the f@@ les@@ h ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spir@@ itual must restore such a one in a spirit of g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess ; looking to yo@@ ur@@ self so that you also ar@@ en '@@ t temp@@ ted .
for he who so@@ ws to his own f@@ les@@ h will from the f@@ les@@ h re@@ ap corruption . but he who so@@ ws to the Spiri@@ t will from the Spiri@@ t re@@ ap eter@@ nal life .
let us not be we@@ ary in doing good , for we will re@@ ap in due season , if we don '@@ t give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
as many as desire to look good in the f@@ les@@ h , they comp@@ el you to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; only that they may not be persec@@ uted for the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for even they who receive circum@@ c@@ ision don '@@ t keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may bo@@ ast in your f@@ les@@ h .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord J@@ es@@ us bran@@ ded on my body .
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be hol@@ y and without ble@@ mis@@ h before him in love ;
to an administration of the ful@@ l@@ ness of the times , to sum up all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the things in the heav@@ ens , and the things on the ear@@ th , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inher@@ it@@ ance , having been fore@@ or@@ da@@ ined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the coun@@ sel of his will ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Go@@ od News of your sal@@ v@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Ch@@ r@@ ist , ali@@ en@@ ated from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
so then you are no longer st@@ ran@@ gers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with the sa@@ ints , and of the household of God ,
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his hol@@ y A@@ post@@ les and pro@@ ph@@ ets in the Spiri@@ t ;
of which I was made a ser@@ vant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
until we all at@@ tain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stat@@ ure of the ful@@ l@@ ness of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
that we may no longer be children , tos@@ sed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doc@@ tr@@ ine , by the tri@@ ck@@ ery of men , in craf@@ tin@@ ess , after the w@@ il@@ es of er@@ ror ;
from whom all the body , being f@@ it@@ ted and k@@ n@@ it together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gen@@ ti@@ les also walk , in the fu@@ tility of their mind ,
being dar@@ ken@@ ed in their understanding , ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God , because of the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts ;
and put on the new man , who in the lik@@ eness of God has been created in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and hol@@ iness of truth .
let him who st@@ ole ste@@ al no more ; but rather let him la@@ bor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your m@@ outh , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a sh@@ ame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are re@@ proved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reve@@ als is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Ch@@ r@@ ist also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Sav@@ ior of the body .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one f@@ les@@ h . "
servants , be obe@@ di@@ ent to those who according to the f@@ les@@ h are your mas@@ ters , with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , in sing@@ len@@ ess of your heart , as to Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
put on the whole arm@@ or of God , that you may be able to stand against the w@@ il@@ es of the dev@@ il .
for our wrestling is not against f@@ les@@ h and blood , but against the princip@@ alities , against the powers , against the world 's rul@@ ers of the d@@ ark@@ ness of this age , and against the spir@@ itual forces of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the heav@@ en@@ ly places .
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to qu@@ en@@ ch all the fi@@ ery dar@@ ts of the ev@@ il one .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , T@@ y@@ chic@@ us , the bel@@ ov@@ ed brother and fa@@ ith@@ ful ser@@ vant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts .
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mer@@ cies of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Go@@ od News ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly b@@ old to speak the word of God without fear .
for I know that this will turn out to my sal@@ vation , through your supp@@ lic@@ ation and the supply of the Spiri@@ t of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
but if I live on in the f@@ les@@ h , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don '@@ t know what I will choose .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
but I hope in the Lord J@@ es@@ us to send Tim@@ o@@ thy to you soon , that I also may be che@@ ered up when I know how you are doing .
for indeed he was si@@ ck , nearly to death , but God had mer@@ cy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sor@@ row on sor@@ row .
not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already at@@ tained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
who will change the body of our hum@@ iliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his gl@@ ory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are hon@@ or@@ able , whatever things are just , whatever things are p@@ ure , whatever things are lov@@ ely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
but I re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revi@@ ved your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you la@@ cked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
you yo@@ ur@@ selves also know , you Philip@@ p@@ ians , that in the beginning of the Go@@ od News , when I depar@@ ted from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don '@@ t ce@@ ase pray@@ ing and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spir@@ itual wis@@ dom and understanding ,
who delivered us out of the power of d@@ ark@@ ness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
for by him all things were created , in the heav@@ ens and on the ear@@ th , things visible and things in@@ visible , whether th@@ ron@@ es or domin@@ ions or princip@@ alities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
and through him to reconc@@ ile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the ear@@ th , or things in the heav@@ ens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
now I re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
for I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you , and for those at La@@ odi@@ cea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the f@@ les@@ h ;
for though I am ab@@ sent in the f@@ les@@ h , yet am I with you in the spirit , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing and seeing your order , and the stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ness of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were ta@@ ught , ab@@ oun@@ ding in it in Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
in whom you were also circum@@ c@@ ised with a circum@@ c@@ ision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h , in the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
having been buried with him in b@@ ap@@ tism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
wi@@ ping out the hand@@ writing in ord@@ inan@@ ces which was against us ; and he has taken it out of the way , n@@ ailing it to the cross ;
let no one therefore judge you in e@@ ating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sab@@ b@@ ath day ,
if then you were raised together with Ch@@ r@@ ist , seek the things that are above , where Ch@@ r@@ ist is , se@@ ated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the ear@@ th .
whatever you do , in word or in de@@ ed , do all in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , giving thanks to God the F@@ ather , through him .
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no parti@@ ality .
Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , my fellow prison@@ er , gre@@ ets you , and Mark , the co@@ us@@ in of Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as ( concerning whom you received comman@@ d@@ ments , " if he comes to you , receive him " ) ,
for I testify about him , that he has great z@@ e@@ al for you , and for those in La@@ odi@@ cea , and for those in H@@ i@@ er@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans ; and that you also read the letter from La@@ odi@@ cea .
Paul , Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ thy , to the assembly of the Thessalon@@ ians in God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : grace to you and peace from God our F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and that our Go@@ od News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spiri@@ t , and with much assur@@ ance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entr@@ usted with the Go@@ od News , so we speak ; not as ple@@ asing men , but God , who tests our hear@@ ts .
nor seeking gl@@ ory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
even so , aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately lon@@ ging for you , we were well pleased to im@@ part to you , not the Go@@ od News of God only , but also our own so@@ ul@@ s , because you had become very de@@ ar to us .
for you remember , brothers , our la@@ bor and trav@@ ail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we pre@@ ached to you the Go@@ od News of God .
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you be@@ fore@@ hand that we are to suffer aff@@ li@@ ction , even as it happened , and you know .
and the Lord make you to increase and ab@@ ound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
and that you make it your ambi@@ tion to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instruc@@ ted you ;
but we don '@@ t want you to be ignor@@ ant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep , so that you don '@@ t gri@@ eve like the rest , who have no hope .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way prece@@ de those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
for the Lord himself will des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with God 's tr@@ ump@@ et . the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist will rise first ,
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the cl@@ ou@@ ds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord fore@@ ver .
but let us , since we belong to the day , be so@@ ber , putting on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of faith and love , and , for a hel@@ met , the hope of sal@@ vation .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith gro@@ ws exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another ab@@ oun@@ ds ;
this is an obvious sign of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted wor@@ thy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
D@@ on '@@ t you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were ta@@ ught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother who walk@@ s in rebel@@ lion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in la@@ bor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
to which I was appointed a pre@@ acher and an A@@ pos@@ tle ( I am telling the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and truth .
but I don '@@ t permit a woman to te@@ ach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness .
( but if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruc@@ t the brothers of these things , you will be a good ser@@ vant of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , no@@ ur@@ ished in the words of the faith , and of the good doc@@ tr@@ ine which you have followed .
for bo@@ dil@@ y exercise has some value , but go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
for to this end we both la@@ bor and suffer re@@ pro@@ ach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Sav@@ ior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man desp@@ ise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in p@@ urity .
but if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an un@@ beli@@ ever .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temp@@ tation and a sn@@ are and many fo@@ ol@@ ish and harmful lu@@ sts , such as dro@@ wn men in ru@@ in and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of ev@@ il . some have been led as@@ tra@@ y from the faith in their gre@@ ed , and have pi@@ er@@ ced themselves through with many sor@@ ro@@ ws .
I than@@ k God , whom I serve as my fore@@ fa@@ thers did , with a p@@ ure con@@ science . how un@@ ce@@ asing is my memory of you in my peti@@ tions , night and day
having been reminded of the sinc@@ ere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grand@@ mother Lo@@ is , and your mother E@@ un@@ ice , and , I am persu@@ aded , in you also .
for this cause , I remin@@ d you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the lay@@ ing on of my hands .
for this , I was appointed as a pre@@ acher , an A@@ pos@@ tle , and a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to fa@@ ith@@ ful men , who will be able to te@@ ach others also .
remin@@ d them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don '@@ t argue about words , to no profit , to the sub@@ ver@@ ting of those who hear .
tra@@ itors , head@@ strong , conce@@ ited , lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ure rather than lov@@ ers of God ;
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gen@@ ti@@ les might hear ; and I was delivered out of the m@@ outh of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every ev@@ il work , and will preserve me for his heav@@ en@@ ly Kingdom ; to whom be the gl@@ ory fore@@ ver and ever . A@@ men .
to Tit@@ us , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mer@@ cy , and peace from God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Sav@@ ior .
I left you in Cre@@ te for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint el@@ ders in every city , as I directed you ;
holding to the fa@@ ith@@ ful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to ex@@ h@@ ort in the sound doc@@ tr@@ ine , and to convic@@ t those who contra@@ dict him .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you o@@ we to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed he@@ ir of all things , through whom also he made the wor@@ l@@ ds .
for to which of the an@@ gel@@ s did he say at any time , " You are my Son . today have I become your father ? " and again , " I will be to him a F@@ ather , and he will be to me a Son ? "
but which of the an@@ gel@@ s has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enem@@ ies the foot@@ st@@ ool of your feet ? "
God also testi@@ fying with them , both by signs and won@@ ders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spiri@@ t , according to his own will ?
you have put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " for in that he subj@@ ected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don '@@ t see all things subj@@ ected to him , yet .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to gl@@ ory , to make the author of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
therefore he was oblig@@ ated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a mer@@ ci@@ ful and fa@@ ith@@ ful high pri@@ est in things per@@ taining to God , to make At@@ on@@ ement for the sin@@ s of the people .
for indeed we have had good news pre@@ ached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard di@@ d@@ n '@@ t profit them , because it was@@ n '@@ t mixed with faith by those who heard .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I s@@ wor@@ e in my wr@@ ath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
there is no cre@@ ature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are nak@@ ed and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high pri@@ est , who has passed through the heav@@ ens , J@@ es@@ us , the Son of God , let us hold tigh@@ tly to our conf@@ ession .
for we don '@@ t have a high pri@@ est who can '@@ t be touched with the feeling of our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities , but one who has been in all points temp@@ ted like we are , yet without sin .
the high pri@@ est can deal g@@ ently with those who are ignor@@ ant and going as@@ tra@@ y , because he himself is also surrounded with weak@@ ness .
so also Ch@@ r@@ ist di@@ d@@ n '@@ t g@@ lor@@ ify himself to be made a high pri@@ est , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his f@@ les@@ h , having offered up pray@@ ers and peti@@ tions with strong cr@@ ying and te@@ ars to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his go@@ dly fear ,
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for he is a baby .
for the land which has dr@@ un@@ k the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a cro@@ p su@@ itable for them for whose sake it is also til@@ led , receives b@@ les@@ sing from God ;
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous , so as to forget your work and the la@@ bor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the sa@@ ints , and still do serve them .
in this way God , being determined to show more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly to the he@@ ir@@ s of the promise the im@@ mut@@ ability of his coun@@ sel , inter@@ posed with an oath ;
they indeed of the sons of L@@ evi who receive the pri@@ est 's office have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Ab@@ ra@@ ham ,
( for they indeed have been made pri@@ ests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord s@@ wor@@ e and will not change his mind , ' You are a pri@@ est fore@@ ver , according to the order of Mel@@ chi@@ zede@@ k . ' "
therefore he is also able to save to the ut@@ ter@@ most those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives fore@@ ver to make inter@@ c@@ ession for them .
for if he were on ear@@ th , he would not be a pri@@ est at all , seeing there are pri@@ ests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
for finding fault with them , he said , " be@@ hold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
" for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
they will not te@@ ach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' K@@ now the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
in that he says , " A new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and gro@@ ws aged is near to van@@ ishing away .
for a tab@@ ern@@ acle was prepared . in the first part were the lam@@ p@@ stand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Pla@@ ce .
having a golden alt@@ ar of incen@@ se , and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant over@@ laid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden po@@ t holding the man@@ na , Aaron 's ro@@ d that bud@@ ded , and the tab@@ lets of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es are offered that are inc@@ ap@@ able , concerning the con@@ science , of making the wor@@ ship@@ per perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of go@@ ats and cal@@ ves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Pla@@ ce , having obtained eter@@ nal re@@ dem@@ ption .
for if the blood of go@@ ats and bul@@ ls , and the ashes of a he@@ if@@ er sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ling those who have been def@@ iled , sanc@@ ti@@ fy to the cle@@ ann@@ ess of the f@@ les@@ h :
for when every comman@@ d@@ ment had been spoken by Mos@@ es to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the cal@@ ves and the go@@ ats , with water and scar@@ let wo@@ ol and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led both the book itself and all the people ,
it was necessary therefore that the cop@@ ies of the things in the heav@@ ens should be cleans@@ ed with these ; but the heav@@ en@@ ly things themselves with better sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es than these .
" this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
not for@@ sak@@ ing our own assemb@@ ling together , as the cust@@ om of some is , but ex@@ hor@@ ting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
for you both had comp@@ as@@ sion on me in my cha@@ ins , and jo@@ y@@ fully accepted the pl@@ undering of your pos@@ sessions , kno@@ wing that you have for yo@@ ur@@ selves a better possession and an en@@ during one in the heav@@ ens .
but we are not of those who shr@@ ink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the sou@@ l .
by faith , we understand that the uni@@ verse has been fra@@ med by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well ple@@ asing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called , obe@@ yed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance . he went out , not kno@@ wing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an ali@@ en in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , d@@ wel@@ ling in ten@@ ts , with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multi@@ tude , and as in@@ num@@ er@@ able as the s@@ and which is by the sea shore , were fa@@ ther@@ ed by one man , and him as good as dead .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
by faith , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , being tested , offered up I@@ sa@@ ac . yes , he who had gla@@ dly received the promises was offering up his one and only son ;
conclu@@ ding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . F@@ ig@@ ur@@ atively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Jac@@ o@@ b , when he was dying , b@@ les@@ sed each of the sons of Joseph , and wor@@ shi@@ ped , le@@ an@@ ing on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instruc@@ tions concerning his b@@ ones .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ,
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wr@@ ath of the king ; for he en@@ du@@ red , as seeing him who is in@@ visible .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on d@@ ry land . when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans tried to do so , they were sw@@ allowed up .
they were st@@ oned . they were sa@@ wn apart . they were temp@@ ted . they were sla@@ in with the s@@ word . they went around in she@@ ep sk@@ ins and in go@@ at sk@@ ins ; being de@@ stitute , aff@@ lic@@ ted , ill @@@ -@@ @ treated
looking to J@@ es@@ us , the author and perf@@ ec@@ ter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising its sh@@ ame , and has sat down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
for consider him who has en@@ du@@ red such con@@ tradi@@ ction of sin@@ ners against himself , that you don '@@ t grow we@@ ary , fa@@ in@@ ting in your so@@ ul@@ s .
and you have forgotten the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don '@@ t take lightly the ch@@ as@@ tening of the Lord , nor fa@@ int when you are re@@ proved by him ;
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made par@@ tak@@ ers , then are you il@@ legitimate , and not children .
therefore lift up the hands that han@@ g down and the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bit@@ ter@@ ness spr@@ inging up trouble you , and many be def@@ iled by it ;
for they could not stand that which was comman@@ ded , " If even an animal tou@@ ches the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned " ;
this ph@@ r@@ ase , " Y@@ et once more , " sig@@ ni@@ fies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way for@@ sake you . "
D@@ on '@@ t be carried away by various and st@@ range teach@@ ings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benef@@ ited .
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the hol@@ y place by the high pri@@ est as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continu@@ ally , that is , the fruit of li@@ ps which procla@@ im alle@@ gi@@ ance to his name .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of the she@@ ep with the blood of an eter@@ nal C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , our Lord J@@ es@@ us ,
but if any of you lacks wis@@ dom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liber@@ ally and without re@@ pro@@ ach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doub@@ ting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tos@@ sed .
for the sun ar@@ ises with the scor@@ ching wind , and Withers the gr@@ ass , and the f@@ lower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance per@@ is@@ hes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursu@@ its .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man who en@@ du@@ res temp@@ tation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the cro@@ wn of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
let no man say when he is temp@@ ted , " I am temp@@ ted by God , " for God can '@@ t be temp@@ ted by ev@@ il , and he himself temp@@ ts no one .
then the l@@ ust , when it has conce@@ ived , be@@ ars sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the F@@ ather of lights , with whom can be no vari@@ ation , nor turning shadow .
for if anyone is a hear@@ er of the word and not a do@@ er , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mir@@ ror ;
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hear@@ er who for@@ gets , but a do@@ er of the work , this man will be b@@ les@@ sed in what he does .
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bri@@ dle his ton@@ gue , but dec@@ e@@ ives his heart , this man 's religion is wor@@ th@@ less .
listen , my bel@@ ov@@ ed brothers . D@@ id@@ n '@@ t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be jud@@ ged by a law of freedom .
for in many things we all st@@ um@@ ble . if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t st@@ um@@ ble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bri@@ dle the whole body also .
and the ton@@ gue is a fire . the world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity among our members is the ton@@ gue , which def@@ il@@ es the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Ge@@ hen@@ na .
with it we b@@ less our God and F@@ ather , and with it we cur@@ se men , who are made in the image of God .
but if you have bitter je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and sel@@ fish ambi@@ tion in your heart , don '@@ t bo@@ ast and don '@@ t lie against the truth .
you ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , don '@@ t you know that friendship with the world is en@@ mity with God ? who@@ ever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
D@@ on '@@ t speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
your gold and your silver are cor@@ ro@@ ded , and their cor@@ ro@@ sion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your f@@ les@@ h like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
be@@ hold , the wages of the labor@@ ers who mo@@ wed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cri@@ es of those who re@@ ap@@ ed have entered into the e@@ ars of the Lord of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
you have lived de@@ lic@@ ately on the ear@@ th , and taken your pleas@@ ure . you have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . be@@ hold , the far@@ mer waits for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fruit of the ear@@ th , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
D@@ on '@@ t gr@@ um@@ ble , brothers , against one another , so that you won '@@ t be jud@@ ged . be@@ hold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the pro@@ ph@@ ets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
is any among you si@@ ck ? let him call for the el@@ ders of the assembly , and let them pra@@ y over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the pray@@ er of faith will he@@ al him who is si@@ ck , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sin@@ s , he will be for@@ given .
Eli@@ j@@ ah was a man with a nature like ours , and he pray@@ ed ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly that it might not rain , and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rain on the ear@@ th for three years and six months .
if you call on him as F@@ ather , who without respect of persons judges according to each man 's work , pass the time of your living as foreigners here in rever@@ ent fear :
who through him are beli@@ ever@@ s in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him gl@@ ory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
but you are a chosen race , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , a hol@@ y nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may procla@@ im the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of him who called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous light :
for this is the will of God , that by well @@@ -@@ @ doing you should put to sil@@ ence the ignor@@ ance of fo@@ ol@@ ish men :
for what gl@@ ory is it if , when you sin , you pati@@ ently en@@ dur@@ e beating ? but if , when you do well , you pati@@ ently en@@ dur@@ e suffering , this is commen@@ dable with God .
who his own self b@@ ore our sin@@ s in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sin@@ s , might live to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; by whose stri@@ pes you were he@@ aled .
let your beauty be not just the ou@@ tw@@ ard ad@@ or@@ ning of bra@@ i@@ ding the ha@@ ir , and of wearing je@@ wel@@ s of gold , or of putting on fine clo@@ thing ;
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righ@@ te@@ ous , and his e@@ ars open to their pray@@ er ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do ev@@ il . "
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with hum@@ il@@ ity and fear :
for to this end the Go@@ od News was pre@@ ached even to the dead , that they might be jud@@ ged indeed as men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live as to God in the spirit .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , don '@@ t be ast@@ on@@ ished at the fi@@ ery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a st@@ range thing happened to you .
if you are ins@@ ulted for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , you are b@@ les@@ sed ; because the Spiri@@ t of gl@@ ory and of God rests on you . on their part he is b@@ las@@ phe@@ med , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
for let none of you suffer as a mur@@ der@@ er , or a th@@ i@@ ef , or an ev@@ il do@@ er , or a med@@ d@@ ler in other men 's matters .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don '@@ t obe@@ y the Go@@ od News of God ?
when the chief she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is revealed , you will receive the cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fade away .
likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the el@@ der . yes , all of you clo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves with hum@@ il@@ ity , to subject yo@@ ur@@ selves to one another ; for " God res@@ ists the proud , but gives grace to the hum@@ ble . "
be so@@ ber and self @@@ -@@ @ controlled . be watch@@ ful . your ad@@ versary , the dev@@ il , walk@@ s around like a ro@@ aring lion , seeking whom he may dev@@ our .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
Simon Peter , a ser@@ vant and A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , to those who have obtained a like pre@@ ci@@ ous faith with us in the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of our God and Sav@@ ior , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
for we did not follow c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but we were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
for if God di@@ d@@ n '@@ t spar@@ e an@@ gel@@ s when they sin@@ ned , but cast them down to Tar@@ tar@@ us , and committed them to p@@ its of d@@ ark@@ ness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live un@@ go@@ dly ;
having eyes full of ad@@ ul@@ tery , and who can '@@ t ce@@ ase from sin ; en@@ tic@@ ing un@@ settled so@@ ul@@ s ; having a heart trained in gre@@ ed ; children of cur@@ sing ;
for@@ sak@@ ing the right way , they went as@@ tra@@ y , having followed the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or , who lov@@ ed the wages of wrongdoing ;
for , ut@@ tering great s@@ wel@@ ling words of emp@@ tin@@ ess , they enti@@ ce in the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , by licen@@ ti@@ ous@@ ness , those who are indeed escap@@ ing from those who live in er@@ ror ;
for if , after they have escaped the def@@ il@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ ior J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the hol@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the comman@@ d@@ ments of us , the A@@ post@@ les of the Lord and Sav@@ ior :
but the heav@@ ens that now are , and the ear@@ th , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of un@@ go@@ dly men .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slow@@ ness ; but is patient with us , not w@@ ishing that any should per@@ ish , but that all should come to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
regard the patience of our Lord as sal@@ vation ; even as our bel@@ ov@@ ed brother Paul also , according to the wis@@ dom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , bel@@ ov@@ ed , kno@@ wing these things be@@ fore@@ hand , be@@ w@@ are , lest being carried away with the er@@ ror of the w@@ ic@@ ked , you fall from your own stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ness .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Wor@@ d of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eter@@ nal life , which was with the F@@ ather , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us . yes , and our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no d@@ ark@@ ness at all .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fel@@ low@@ ship with one another , and the blood of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , his Son , cleans@@ es us from all sin .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sin@@ s , we have a coun@@ sel@@ or with the F@@ ather , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the righ@@ te@@ ous .
one who says , " I know him , " and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , is a li@@ ar , and the truth is@@ n '@@ t in him .
but who@@ ever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perf@@ ected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
he who says he is in the light and ha@@ tes his brother , is in the d@@ ark@@ ness even until now .
but he who ha@@ tes his brother is in the d@@ ark@@ ness , and walk@@ s in the d@@ ark@@ ness , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know where he is going , because the d@@ ark@@ ness has b@@ lin@@ ded his eyes .
I write to you , fa@@ thers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the ev@@ il one . I write to you , little children , because you know the F@@ ather .
I have written to you , fa@@ thers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the ev@@ il one .
D@@ on '@@ t love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone lov@@ es the world , the F@@ ather 's love is@@ n '@@ t in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the F@@ ather 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist is coming , even now many anti@@ ch@@ rist@@ s have ar@@ isen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
they went out from us , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
I have not written to you because you don '@@ t know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the li@@ ar but he who denies that J@@ es@@ us is the Ch@@ r@@ ist ? this is the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , he who denies the F@@ ather and the Son .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . but we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
he who sin@@ s is of the dev@@ il , for the dev@@ il has been sin@@ ning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the dev@@ il .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the dev@@ il . who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother remains in death .
but who@@ ever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and clos@@ es his heart of comp@@ as@@ sion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
this is his comman@@ d@@ ment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and love one another , even as he comman@@ ded .
and every spirit who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t conf@@ ess that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist has come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
we are of God . he who knows God list@@ ens to us . he who is not of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of er@@ ror .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have bol@@ d@@ ness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
if a man says , " I love God , " and ha@@ tes his brother , he is a li@@ ar ; for he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
this is he who came by water and blood , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . it is the Spiri@@ t who testi@@ fies , because the Spiri@@ t is the truth .
for there are three who testify :
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eter@@ nal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the bol@@ d@@ ness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he list@@ ens to us .
and if we know that he list@@ ens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the peti@@ tions which we have asked of him .
we know that who@@ ever is born of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the ev@@ il one do@@ es@@ n '@@ t touch him .
we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist . this is the true God , and eter@@ nal life .
grace , mer@@ cy , and peace will be with us , from God the F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of the F@@ ather , in truth and love .
I re@@ jo@@ ice greatly that I have found some of your children walk@@ ing in truth , even as we have been comman@@ ded by the F@@ ather .
this is love , that we should walk according to his comman@@ d@@ ments . this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
watch yo@@ ur@@ selves , that we don '@@ t lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
having many things to write to you , I don '@@ t want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way wor@@ thy of God ,
bel@@ ov@@ ed , don '@@ t im@@ itate that which is ev@@ il , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does ev@@ il has@@ n '@@ t seen God .
now I desire to remin@@ d you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having sav@@ ed a people out of the land of Egypt , after@@ ward destroyed those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe .
but Michael , the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , when conten@@ ding with the dev@@ il and arguing about the body of Mos@@ es , dar@@ ed not bring against him an ab@@ u@@ sive condem@@ nation , but said , " May the Lord re@@ bu@@ ke you ! "
this is the reve@@ lation of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his an@@ gel to his ser@@ vant , John ,
b@@ les@@ sed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his m@@ outh proce@@ eded a sharp two @@@ -@@ @ ed@@ ged s@@ word . his face was like the sun sh@@ ining at its bri@@ gh@@ test .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen her@@ e@@ after ;
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lam@@ p@@ stands . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven assemb@@ lies . the seven lam@@ p@@ stands are seven assemb@@ lies .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in E@@ ph@@ es@@ us write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walk@@ s among the seven golden lam@@ p@@ stands says these things :
remember therefore from where you have fallen , and rep@@ ent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you swi@@ f@@ tly , and will move your lam@@ p@@ stand out of its place , unless you rep@@ ent .
he who has an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t says to the assemb@@ lies . to him who over@@ comes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Par@@ ad@@ ise of my God .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Sm@@ yr@@ na write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , op@@ pression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass , says these things :
I will kill her children with De@@ ath , and all the assemb@@ lies will know that I am he who sear@@ ches the min@@ ds and hear@@ ts . I will give to each one of you according to your de@@ eds .
" and to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Sar@@ dis write : " he who has the seven spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yo@@ urs perf@@ ected before my God .
he who over@@ comes will be ar@@ ray@@ ed in white gar@@ ments , and I will in no way blo@@ t his name out of the book of life , and I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write : " he who is hol@@ y , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who sh@@ u@@ ts and no one opens , says these things :

be@@ hold , I give of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed you .
because you kept my command to en@@ dur@@ e , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in La@@ odi@@ cea write : " the A@@ men , the fa@@ ith@@ ful and Tru@@ e Wit@@ ness , the He@@ ad of God 's creation , says these things :
because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten ri@@ ches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don '@@ t know that you are the w@@ ret@@ ched one , mis@@ er@@ able , poor , b@@ lin@@ d , and nak@@ ed ;
he who over@@ comes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my th@@ r@@ one , as I also over@@ came , and sat down with my F@@ ather on his th@@ r@@ one .
before the th@@ r@@ one was something like a sea of glass , similar to cr@@ y@@ st@@ al . in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one , and around the th@@ r@@ one were four living cre@@ atures full of eyes before and behind .
the first cre@@ ature was like a lion , and the second cre@@ ature like a cal@@ f , and the third cre@@ ature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying e@@ ag@@ le .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the th@@ r@@ one , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven se@@ als .
no one in heav@@ en above , or on the ear@@ th , or under the ear@@ th , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
I saw in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four living cre@@ atures , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , a lam@@ b standing , as though it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God , sent out into all the ear@@ th .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the th@@ r@@ one .
now when he had taken the book , the four living cre@@ atures and the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four el@@ ders fell down before the lam@@ b , each one having a har@@ p , and golden bo@@ w@@ ls full of incen@@ se , which are the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many an@@ gel@@ s around the th@@ r@@ one , the living cre@@ atures , and the el@@ ders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
and be@@ hold , a white hor@@ se , and he who sat on it had a bo@@ w . a cro@@ wn was given to him , and he came forth conqu@@ ering , and to conqu@@ er .
when he opened the third se@@ al , I heard the third living cre@@ ature saying , " C@@ ome and see ! " and be@@ hold , a black hor@@ se , and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
when he opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under@@ ne@@ ath the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of those who had been killed for the Wor@@ d of God , and for the testimony of the lam@@ b which they had .
a long white ro@@ be was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
the kings of the ear@@ th , the pr@@ inces , the comman@@ ding officers , the rich , the strong , and every sla@@ ve and free person , hi@@ d themselves in the c@@ aves and in the ro@@ cks of the mountains .
after this , I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing at the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , so that no wind would blow on the ear@@ th , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another an@@ gel as@@ cen@@ d from the sun@@ rise , having the se@@ al of the living God . he cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice to the four an@@ gel@@ s to whom it was given to harm the ear@@ th and the sea ,
saying , " D@@ on '@@ t harm the ear@@ th , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bon@@ d@@ servants of our God on their fore@@ heads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , sealed out of every tri@@ be of the children of Israel :
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice , saying , " sal@@ vation be to our God , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one , and to the lam@@ b ! "
all the an@@ gel@@ s were standing around the th@@ r@@ one , the el@@ ders , and the four living cre@@ atures ; and they fell on their faces before his th@@ r@@ one , and wor@@ shi@@ ped God ,
I told him , " My lor@@ d , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tri@@ bu@@ lation . they was@@ hed their rob@@ es , and made them white in the lam@@ b 's blood .
for the lam@@ b who is in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds them , and leads them to spr@@ ings of waters of life . and God will wi@@ pe away every tear from their eyes . "
the smoke of the incen@@ se , with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , went up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
the an@@ gel took the cen@@ ser , and he filled it with the fire of the alt@@ ar , and threw it on the ear@@ th . there followed th@@ unders , so@@ unds , ligh@@ t@@ nings , and an earthquake .
the first so@@ unded , and there followed ha@@ il and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the ear@@ th . one third of the ear@@ th was bur@@ n@@ t up , and one third of the trees were bur@@ n@@ t up , and all green gr@@ ass was bur@@ n@@ t up .
the third an@@ gel so@@ unded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a tor@@ ch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the spr@@ ings of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wor@@ m@@ wood . " one third of the waters became wor@@ m@@ wood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth an@@ gel so@@ unded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the ear@@ th . the key to the p@@ it of the ab@@ y@@ ss was given to him .
he opened the p@@ it of the ab@@ y@@ ss , and smoke went up out of the p@@ it , like the smoke from a burning fur@@ n@@ ace . the sun and the air were dar@@ ken@@ ed because of the smoke from the p@@ it .
then out of the smoke came forth loc@@ ust@@ s on the ear@@ th , and power was given to them , as the S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions of the ear@@ th have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don '@@ t have God 's se@@ al on their fore@@ heads .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
they had bre@@ ast@@ plates , like bre@@ ast@@ plates of iron . the sound of their w@@ ings was like the sound of char@@ i@@ ots , or of many hor@@ ses rus@@ hing to war .
they have over them as king the an@@ gel of the ab@@ y@@ ss . his name in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w is " Ab@@ add@@ on , " but in Greek , he has the name " A@@ poll@@ yon . "
thus I saw the hor@@ ses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having bre@@ ast@@ plates of fi@@ ery red , hy@@ ac@@ inth blue , and sul@@ f@@ ur yel@@ low ; and the heads of li@@ ons . out of their m@@ ou@@ ths proceed fire , smoke , and sul@@ f@@ ur .
by these three plagu@@ es were one third of man@@ kind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sul@@ f@@ ur , which proce@@ eded out of their m@@ ou@@ ths .
for the power of the hor@@ ses is in their m@@ ou@@ ths , and in their ta@@ ils . for their ta@@ ils are like Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent of their murders , nor of their sor@@ cer@@ ies , nor of their sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , nor of their the@@ fts .
I saw a m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel coming down out of the sky , clo@@ th@@ ed with a cl@@ oud . a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pil@@ lars of fire .
when the seven th@@ unders so@@ unded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Se@@ al up the things which the seven th@@ unders said , and don '@@ t write them . "
but in the days of the voice of the seventh an@@ gel , when he is about to sound , then the my@@ ster@@ y of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
the voice which I heard from heav@@ en , again speaking with me , said , " G@@ o , take the book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh . when I had e@@ aten it , my st@@ om@@ ach was made bitter .
leave out the court which is outside of the temp@@ le , and don '@@ t measure it , for it has been given to the nations . they will tre@@ ad the hol@@ y city under fo@@ ot for for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two months .
when they have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that comes up out of the ab@@ y@@ ss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
from among the peoples , tri@@ bes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th re@@ jo@@ ice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two pro@@ ph@@ ets tor@@ mented those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
after the three and a half days , the bre@@ ath of life from God entered into them , and they stood on their feet . great fear fell on those who saw them .
in that day there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were ter@@ ri@@ fied , and gave gl@@ ory to the God of heav@@ en .
the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded , and great voices in heav@@ en followed , saying , " The k@@ ing@@ dom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist . he will reign fore@@ ver and ever ! "
his ta@@ il drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the ear@@ th . the dra@@ g@@ on stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might dev@@ our her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a ro@@ d of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his th@@ r@@ one .
the great dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , he who is called the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , the dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were thrown down with him .
they over@@ came him because of the lam@@ b 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t love their life , even to death .
therefore re@@ jo@@ ice , heav@@ ens , and you who d@@ well in them . Wo@@ e to the ear@@ th and to the sea , because the dev@@ il has gone down to you , having great wr@@ ath , kno@@ wing that he has but a short time . "
when the dra@@ g@@ on saw that he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , he persec@@ uted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
two w@@ ings of the great e@@ ag@@ le were given to the woman , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to her place , so that she might be no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
the ser@@ p@@ ent spe@@ wed water out of his m@@ outh after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the dra@@ g@@ on grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her se@@ ed , who keep God 's comman@@ d@@ ments and hold J@@ es@@ us ' testimony .
then I stood on the s@@ and of the sea . I saw a be@@ ast coming up out of the sea , having ten hor@@ ns and seven heads . on his hor@@ ns were ten crow@@ ns , and on his heads , b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ous names .
the be@@ ast which I saw was like a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his m@@ outh like the m@@ outh of a lion . the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , his th@@ r@@ one , and great authority .
they wor@@ shi@@ ped the dra@@ g@@ on , because he gave his authority to the be@@ ast , and they wor@@ shi@@ ped the be@@ ast , saying , " Wh@@ o is like the be@@ ast ? who is able to make war with him ? "
all who d@@ well on the ear@@ th will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lam@@ b who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the s@@ word , he must be killed . here is the en@@ dur@@ ance and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
he exercises all the authority of the first be@@ ast in his presence . he makes the ear@@ th and those who d@@ well in it to worship the first be@@ ast , whose fatal wo@@ und was he@@ aled .
it was given to him to give bre@@ ath to it , to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause as many as wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the be@@ ast to be killed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the sla@@ ve , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their fore@@ heads ;
here is wis@@ dom . he who has understanding , let him calc@@ ulate the number of the be@@ ast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six .
I saw , and be@@ hold , the lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his F@@ ather , written on their fore@@ heads .
I heard a sound from heav@@ en , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Th@@ under . the sound which I heard was like that of har@@ p@@ ists playing on their har@@ ps .
another , a second an@@ gel , followed , saying , " Bab@@ yl@@ on the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality . "
the smoke of their tor@@ ment goes up fore@@ ver and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and who@@ ever receives the mark of his name .
another an@@ gel came out from the temp@@ le , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice to him who sat on the cl@@ oud , " S@@ end forth your si@@ ck@@ le , and re@@ ap ; for the hour to re@@ ap has come ; for the har@@ v@@ est of the ear@@ th is ri@@ pe ! "
the win@@ e@@ press was tro@@ dden outside of the city , and blood came out from the win@@ e@@ press , even to the bri@@ d@@ les of the hor@@ ses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadi@@ a .
the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temp@@ le , until the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s would be finished .
the first went , and p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the ear@@ th , and it became a harmful and ev@@ il sor@@ e on the people who had the mark of the be@@ ast , and who wor@@ shi@@ ped his image .
the second an@@ gel p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
people were scor@@ ched with great heat , and people b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the name of God who has the power over these plagu@@ es . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent and give him gl@@ ory .
the fifth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the th@@ r@@ one of the be@@ ast , and his k@@ ing@@ dom was dar@@ ken@@ ed . they gn@@ a@@ wed their ton@@ gues because of the p@@ ain ,
and they b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the God of heav@@ en because of their pain@@ s and their so@@ res . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent of their works .
the sixth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the great river , the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates . its water was dri@@ ed up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sun@@ rise .
I saw coming out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t , three un@@ clean spir@@ its , something like fro@@ gs ;
for they are spir@@ its of dem@@ ons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited ear@@ th , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
" be@@ hold , I come like a th@@ i@@ ef . b@@ les@@ sed is he who wat@@ ches , and keeps his clo@@ th@@ es , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t walk nak@@ ed , and they see his sh@@ ame . "
the seventh p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the air . a l@@ oud voice came forth out of the temp@@ le of heav@@ en , from the th@@ r@@ one , saying , " It is done ! "
the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Bab@@ yl@@ on the great was remember@@ ed in the sight of God , to give to her the c@@ up of the wine of the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath .
with whom the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and those who d@@ well in the ear@@ th were made dr@@ un@@ ken with the wine of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality . "
the woman was d@@ ressed in pur@@ ple and scar@@ let , and dec@@ ked with gold and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones and pe@@ ar@@ ls , having in her hand a golden c@@ up full of ab@@ omin@@ ations and the imp@@ ur@@ ities of the sexual im@@ mor@@ ality of the ear@@ th .
and on her fore@@ head a name was written , " my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of the pro@@ stitu@@ tes and of the AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman dr@@ un@@ ken with the blood of the sa@@ ints , and with the blood of the m@@ art@@ yr@@ s of J@@ es@@ us . when I saw her , I won@@ dered with great amaz@@ ement .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the ten hor@@ ns that you saw are ten kings who have received no k@@ ing@@ dom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the be@@ ast , for one hour .
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
for God has put in their hear@@ ts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their k@@ ing@@ dom to the be@@ ast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
he cri@@ ed with a m@@ igh@@ ty voice , saying , " fallen , fallen is Bab@@ yl@@ on the great , and she has become a habi@@ tation of dem@@ ons , a prison of every un@@ clean spirit , and a prison of every un@@ clean and ha@@ te@@ ful bird !
for all the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th grew rich from the ab@@ und@@ ance of her luxury . "
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the c@@ up which she mixed , mi@@ x to her double .
the kings of the ear@@ th , who committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality and lived w@@ ant@@ only with her , will we@@ ep and wa@@ il over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
a m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Th@@ us with violence will Bab@@ yl@@ on , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lam@@ p will sh@@ ine no more at all in you . the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de will be heard no more at all in you ; for your mer@@ chan@@ ts were the pr@@ inces of the ear@@ th ; for with your sor@@ cer@@ y all the nations were dec@@ e@@ ived .
in her was found the blood of pro@@ ph@@ ets and of sa@@ ints , and of all who have been sla@@ in on the ear@@ th . "
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments . for he has jud@@ ged the great pro@@ stitute , who cor@@ rupted the ear@@ th with her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and he has av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us re@@ jo@@ ice and be exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , and let us give the gl@@ ory to him . for the marriage of the lam@@ b has come , and his wife has made her@@ self ready . "
it was given to her that she would array her@@ self in bright , p@@ ure , fine lin@@ en : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the sa@@ ints .
he has on his gar@@ ment and on his th@@ igh a name written , " King of K@@ ings , and Lord of lor@@ ds . "
I saw the be@@ ast , and the kings of the ear@@ th , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the hor@@ se , and against his army .
the rest were killed with the s@@ word of him who sat on the hor@@ se , the s@@ word which came forth out of his m@@ outh . all the birds were filled with their f@@ les@@ h .
he seized the dra@@ g@@ on , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , which is the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , who dec@@ e@@ ives the whole inhabited ear@@ th , and bound him for a thousand years ,
b@@ les@@ sed and hol@@ y is he who has part in the first resur@@ rec@@ tion . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be pri@@ ests of God and of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and will reign with him one thousand years .
and he will come out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
they went up over the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , and surrounded the camp of the sa@@ ints , and the bel@@ ov@@ ed city . fire came down out of heav@@ en from God , and dev@@ oured them .
the dev@@ il who dec@@ e@@ ived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sul@@ f@@ ur , where the be@@ ast and the false pro@@ phe@@ t are also . they will be tor@@ mented day and night fore@@ ver and ever .
I saw a great white th@@ r@@ one , and him who sat on it , from whose face the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the th@@ r@@ one , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were jud@@ ged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and H@@ ades gave up the dead who were in them . they were jud@@ ged , each one according to his works .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
he will wi@@ pe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor cr@@ ying , nor p@@ ain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he said to me , " It is done ! I am the Alpha and the O@@ me@@ ga , the Beg@@ in@@ ning and the En@@ d . I will give freely to him who is thir@@ st@@ y from the spring of the water of life .
one of the seven an@@ gel@@ s who had the seven bo@@ w@@ ls , who were loaded with the seven last plagu@@ es came , and he spoke with me , saying , " C@@ ome here . I will show you the wife , the lam@@ b 's bri@@ de . "
having a great and high wall ; having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve an@@ gel@@ s ; and names written on them , which are the names of the twelve tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
its wall is one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four cu@@ bi@@ ts , by the measure of a man , that is , of an an@@ gel .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to sh@@ ine , for the very gl@@ ory of God ill@@ umin@@ ated it , and its lam@@ p is the lam@@ b .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the ear@@ th bring the gl@@ ory and hon@@ or of the nations into it .
and they shall bring the gl@@ ory and the hon@@ or of the nations into it so that they may enter .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as cr@@ y@@ st@@ al , proce@@ eding out of the th@@ r@@ one of God and of the lam@@ b ,
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fru@@ its , yi@@ el@@ ding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the he@@ aling of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel who had shown me these things .
he who acts un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , let him act un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly still . he who is fil@@ thy , let him be fil@@ thy still . he who is righ@@ te@@ ous , let him do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness still . he who is hol@@ y , let him be hol@@ y still . "
b@@ les@@ sed are those who do his comman@@ d@@ ments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
the Spiri@@ t and the bri@@ de say , " C@@ ome ! " he who he@@ ars , let him say , " C@@ ome ! " he who is thir@@ st@@ y , let him come . he who desi@@ res , let him take the water of life freely .
if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , may God take away his part from the tree of life , and out of the hol@@ y city , which are written in this book .
