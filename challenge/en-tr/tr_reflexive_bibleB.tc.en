then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :

they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
the Lord also spake unto Joshua , saying ,
thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the Congregation of the Lord ,

but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
for there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
then came to him the mother of Zebedee 's children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
they say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
and when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
and greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
the Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
and when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
and Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
and if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
and should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
and he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
for David himself said by the Holy ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies THY footstool .
David therefore himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .
and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
the Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
and the second time the Cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the Cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
but go your way , tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
he shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
for he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in THY brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . and he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .

and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels .
and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
and when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I cannot dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
and he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
and shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
and they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
and he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
and many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
and they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
and they said one to another , did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
he was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
he came unto his own , and his own received him not .
the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold the lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
this is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
he first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
but he spake of the temple of his body .
and needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
for Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
so the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
the man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
if I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
when Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
it is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
( but this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
Jesus answered and said unto them , Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye cannot tell whence I come , and whither I go .
I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come .
they understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
and his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
but by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
he answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
if he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture cannot be broken ;
there they made him a Supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
for he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
and ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
for the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
and for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
that the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none .
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
the Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
and how hear we every man in our own tongue , wherein we were born ?
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
for David is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , The Lord said unto my Lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ?
and with many other words did he testify and exhort , saying , Save yourselves from this untoward generation .
and they continued stedfastly in the Apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
so Jacob went down into Egypt , and died , he , and our fathers ,
then Simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
and the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
but Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
and he fell to the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
a devout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God alway .
and when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
as they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy ghost said , separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them .
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
and when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the Apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
and Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and they spake unto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
that they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
and when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ .
and he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
then said Paul , John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on Christ Jesus .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
but when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
and after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
and there abode three months . and when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
and we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
and as they bound him with thongs , Paul said unto the centurion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and uncondemned ?
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
and he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
but rise , and stand upon THY feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
therefore thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoever thou art that judgest : for wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things .
but after THY hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest THY boast of God ,
Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
and not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the Atonement .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
and I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of Goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
salute one another with an holy kiss . the churches of Christ salute you .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius ;
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
the wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I.
but as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ordain I in all churches .
mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
and unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
but if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
and when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
and why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
all the brethren greet you . greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
for we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus ' sake .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
and his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ 's , even so are we Christ 's .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
for such are false Apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ .
and no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
and I will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly I love you , the less I be loved .
greet one another with an holy kiss .
and the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed .
they zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God for Christ 's sake hath forgiven you .
and walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity . Amen .
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
continue in prayer , and watch in the same with Thanksgiving ;
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour ;
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
Wherefore comfort one another with these words .
and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . the Lord be with you all .
the salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
but refuse profane and old wives ' fables , and exercise thyself rather unto godliness .
till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that THY profiting may appear to all .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men 's sins : keep thyself pure .
for the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
knowing that he that is such is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned of himself .
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they be not unfruitful .
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
if thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
there salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ;
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
but exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
and by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God cannot be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
but the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
while they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy ghost ,
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
and I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and I looked , and , lo , a lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
and the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
his eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
