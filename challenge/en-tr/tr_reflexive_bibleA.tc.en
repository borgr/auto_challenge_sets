he allowed no one to follow him , except Peter , James , and John the brother of James .
they ridiculed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .

they began to be sorrowful , and to ask him one by one , " surely not I ? " and another said , " surely not I ? "

therefore I didn 't even think myself worthy to come to you ; but say the word , and my servant will be healed .
now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
Simon answered , " He , I suppose , to whom he forgave the most . " he said to him , " You have judged correctly . "

they said one to another , " Weren 't our hearts burning within us , while he spoke to us along the way , and while he opened the Scriptures to us ? "
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb .
he was not the light , but was sent that he might testify about the light .
he came to his own , and those who were his own didn 't receive him .

but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers .

the man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .

" if I testify about myself , my witness is not valid .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "

for no one does anything in secret , and himself seeks to be known openly . if you do these things , reveal yourself to the world . "
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
but he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn 't yet glorified .
I am one who testifies about myself , and the Father who sent me testifies about me . "
the Jews therefore said , " Will he kill himself , that he says , ' Where I am going , you can 't come ? ' "
they didn 't understand that he spoke to them about the Father .

we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
he answered , " Who is he , Lord , that I may believe in him ? "
if he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can 't be broken ) ,
so they made him a Supper there . Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and was going to God ,
for he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . "
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
therefore you now have sorrow , but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , " Of those whom you have given me , I have lost none . "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
the Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
how do we hear , everyone in our own native language ?
therefore , being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the flesh , he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne ,
for David didn 't ascend into the heavens , but he says himself , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit by my right hand ,
now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles , " Brothers , what shall we do ? "
with many other words he testified , and exhorted them , saying , " Save yourselves from this crooked generation ! "
they continued steadfastly in the Apostles ' teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread , and prayer .
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and all that is in them ;
but we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word . "
Jacob went down into Egypt , and he died , himself and our fathers ,
Simon himself also believed . being baptized , he continued with Philip . seeing signs and great miracles occurring , he was amazed .
the eunuch answered Philip , " Who is the prophet talking about ? about himself , or about someone else ? "
but Philip was found at Azotus . passing through , he preached the Good News to all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
he fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? "
a devout man , and one who feared God with all his house , who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people , and always prayed to God .
having explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
as they served the Lord and fasted , the Holy Spirit said , " separate Barnabas and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses to the people .
yet he didn 't leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . "
even saying these things , they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them .
when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the Apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
all the multitude kept silence , and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them .
Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations , to take out of them a people for his name .
Judas and Silas , also being prophets themselves , encouraged the brothers with many words , and strengthened them .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes , and was immediately baptized , he and all his household .
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
but when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was compelled by the Spirit , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
he came to Ephesus , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
Paul said , " John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him , that is , in Jesus . "
having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
after the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , took leave of them , and departed to go into Macedonia .
when he had spent three months there , and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he determined to return through Macedonia .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , intending himself to go by land .
therefore watch , remembering that for a period of three years I didn 't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears .
when they had tied him up with thongs , Paul asked the centurion who stood by , " Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and not found guilty ? "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
desiring to know the cause why they accused him , I brought him down to their council .
so the soldiers , carrying out their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
therefore you are without excuse , O man , whoever you are who judge . for in that which you judge another , you condemn yourself . for you who judge practice the same things .
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
indeed you bear the name of a Jew , and rest on the law , and glory in God ,
you therefore who teach another , don 't you teach yourself ? you who preach that a man shouldn 't steal , do you steal ?
not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation .
neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God ;
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don 't know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can 't be uttered .
but indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
" it will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
in love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another ; in honor preferring one another ;
rejoicing in hope ; enduring in troubles ; continuing steadfastly in prayer ;
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
I myself am also persuaded about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of Goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish others .
yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
greet one another with a holy kiss . the assemblies of Christ greet you .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
I thank God that I baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius ,
let no one deceive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
the wife doesn 't have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband doesn 't have authority over his own body , but the wife .
Don 't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn 't tempt you because of your lack of self @-@ control .
but I say to the unmarried and to widows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am .
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
my defense to those who examine me is this .
to the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
every man who strives in the games exercises self @-@ control in all things . now they do it to receive a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible .
for if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn 't be judged .
he who speaks in another language edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
but if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant .
when all things have been subjected to him , then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour ?
all the brothers greet you . greet one another with a holy kiss .
are we beginning again to commend ourselves ? or do we need , as do some , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
for we don 't preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake ;
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sakes died and rose again .
his affection is more abundantly toward you , while he remembers all of your obedience , how with fear and trembling you received him .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ 's , so also we are Christ 's .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
for such men are false Apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as Christ 's Apostles .
and no wonder , for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light .
it is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their works .
I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . if I love you more abundantly , am I loved the less ?
greet one another with a holy kiss .
the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham , saying , " In you all the nations will be blessed . "
they zealously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to alienate you , that you may seek them .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
but let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches .
for even they who receive circumcision don 't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
who having become callous gave themselves up to lust , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
and be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , just as God also in Christ forgave you .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @-@ smelling fragrance .
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ .
husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the assembly , and gave himself up for it ;
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
stand therefore , having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love . Amen .
doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
I have sent him therefore the more diligently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do .
continue steadfastly in prayer , watching therein with Thanksgiving ;
I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts ,
as you know , we exhorted , comforted , and implored every one of you , as a father does his own children ,
now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
but concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
