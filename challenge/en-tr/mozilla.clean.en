A strong password uses a combination of upper and lowercase letters , special characters , and numbers . It doesn 't contain personal info like your address , birthday , or family names .
A strong PIN does not contain personal info , such as your date of birth or address . It should be a number only you know and can 't be easily guessed .

No more making up new passwords
No more " try again " while you 're trying to get somewhere . Log in to your Firefox Account on your phone , and your passwords come with you . Your login details will simply appear , just like that .
No one likes a computer hog ! Firefox is a lean , mean ( actually we 're pretty nice ) browsing machine . Since we use less RAM than Chrome , your other programs can keep running at top speed .
No strings attached
No thanks , I 'll just wait for the email
Not interested in our newsletters , but like those special announcements ? No problem .
Not only do trackers collect info , they can weigh down your browsing speeds . Only Firefox Private Browsing blocks ads with hidden trackers , so you can drop the baggage and browse freely .

No problem . Not sure how you want to help ? We can find the appropriate contribution activity for you .

Now 2x faster
No , we do not buy people 's data to target advertising .
Now Firefox creates and stores strong passwords for more of your online accounts - and stops more trackers than ever before .
Now Firefox Monitor not only informs you if you 've been involved in known online data breaches , it also lets you take action to resolve them and get closure .
Now get on the go .
Now you can see how we 're protecting your privacy .

Thunderbird is funded by users like you
Thunderbird is no longer funded by Mozilla . Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further . But to survive long term , the project needs funding .
Thunderbird is the leading open source , cross @-@ platform email and calendaring client , free for business and personal use . We want it to stay secure and become even better .
Thunderbird lives at the nonprofit < a href = " % ( foundation ) s " > Mozilla Foundation < / a > .
Thunderbird makes email better for you , bringing together speed , privacy and the latest technologies . Focus on what matters and forget about complexity .
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection . To ensure a user 's privacy , Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages .
