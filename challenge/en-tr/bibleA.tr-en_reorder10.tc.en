now the earth was formless and empty . darkness was on the surface of the deep . God 's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters .
God said , " Let the earth yield grass , herbs yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its seed in it , on the earth " ; and it was so .
the earth yielded grass , herbs yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its seed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God created the large sea creatures , and every living creature that moves , with which the waters swarmed , after their kind , and every winged bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the livestock , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . "
God blessed them . God said to them , " Be fruitful , multiply , fill the earth , and subdue it . have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the sky , and over every living thing that moves on the earth . "
God said , " behold , I have given you every herb yielding seed , which is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree , which bears fruit yielding seed . it will be your food .
to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that creeps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green herb for food " ; and it was so .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
no plant of the field was yet in the earth , and no herb of the field had yet sprung up ; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth . there was not a man to till the ground ,
out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden , and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from there it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is Pishon : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
the name of the second river is Gihon : the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush .
the name of the third river is Hiddekel : this is the one which flows in front of Assyria . the fourth river is the Euphrates .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
the man gave names to all livestock , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a delight to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
so he drove out the man ; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden , and the flame of a sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
but he didn 't respect Cain and his offering . Cain was very angry , and the expression on his face fell .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
Cain said to Abel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel , his brother , and killed him .
now you are Cursed because of the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Cain knew his wife . she conceived , and gave birth to Enoch . he built a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , Enoch .
to Enoch was born Irad . Irad became the father of Mehujael . Mehujael became the father of Methushael . Methushael became the father of Lamech .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's likeness .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own likeness , after his image , and named him Seth .
the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years , and he became the father of sons and daughters .
it happened , when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground , and daughters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's daughters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose .
Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him in his heart .
Yahweh said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
this is the history of the generations of Noah . Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time . Noah walked with God .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cubit upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this earth , to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the earth will die .
but I will establish my Covenant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wives with you .
of every living thing of all flesh , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
of the birds after their kind , of the livestock after their kind , of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
it happened after the seven days , that the waters of the flood came on the earth .
in the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
in the same day Noah , and Shem , ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
they , and every animal after its kind , all the livestock after their kind , every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground , including man , livestock , creeping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the earth . only Noah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
God remembered Noah , all the animals , and all the livestock that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the earth . the waters subsided .
the deep 's fountains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was restrained .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on Ararat 's mountains .
the waters receded continually until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from the earth . Noah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the surface of the ground was dried .
in the second month , on the twenty @-@ seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
Noah built an altar to Yahweh , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground teems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
I will establish my Covenant with you : all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood , neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth . "
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a Covenant between me and the earth .
and I will remember my Covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh , and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
the rainbow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "
God said to Noah , " This is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth . "
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem , ham , and Japheth . sons were born to them after the flood .
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands , everyone after his language , after their families , in their nations .
Canaan became the father of Sidon ( his firstborn ) , Heth ,
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to Shem , the father of all the children of Eber , the elder brother of Japheth , to him also were children born .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
it happened , as they traveled east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and they lived there .
they said , " Come , let 's build ourselves a city , and a tower whose top reaches to the sky , and let 's make ourselves a name , lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth . "
Yahweh said , " behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
this is the history of the generations of Shem . Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood .
now this is the history of the generations of Terah . Terah became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran . Haran became the father of lot .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
Terah took Abram his son , lot the son of Haran , his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter @-@ in @-@ law , his son Abram 's wife . they went from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan . they came to Haran and lived there .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will bless those who bless you , and I will curse him who curses you . all of the families of the earth will be blessed in you . "
Abram took Sarai his wife , lot his brother 's son , all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran , and they went to go into the land of Canaan . into the land of Canaan they came .
he left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and AI on the east . there he built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh .
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyptians will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their substance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Isn 't the whole land before you ? please separate yourself from me . if you go to the left hand , then I will go to the right . or if you go to the right hand , then I will go to the left . "
so lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself . lot traveled east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Yahweh said to Abram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , northward and southward and eastward and westward ,
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its breadth ; for I will give it to you . "
it happened in the days of Amraphel , king of Shinar , Arioch , king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer , king of Elam , and tidal , king of Goiim ,
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
they returned , and came to En Mishpat ( the same is Kadesh ) , and struck all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that lived in Hazazon Tamar .
now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hills .
one who had escaped came and told Abram , the Hebrew . now he lived by the oaks of Mamre , the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner ; and these were allies of Abram .
when Abram heard that his relative was taken captive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursued them to Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
the king of Sodom went out to meet him , after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , at the valley of Shaveh ( that is , the King 's Valley ) .
and blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand . " Abram gave him a tenth of all .
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . let them take their portion . "
Abram said , " behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
Yahweh brought him outside , and said , " Look now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Abram , " So shall your seed be . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he didn 't divide the birds .
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
now Sarai , Abram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " I will greatly multiply your seed , that they will not be numbered for multitude . "
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " behold , you are with child , and will bear a son . you shall call his name Ishmael , because Yahweh has heard your affliction .
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will establish my Covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God to you and to your seed after you .
this is my Covenant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your seed after you . every male among you shall be circumcised .
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin . it will be a token of the Covenant between me and you .
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circumcised . my Covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting Covenant .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my Covenant . "
I will bless her , and moreover I will give you a son by her . yes , I will bless her , and she will be a mother of nations . Kings of peoples will come from her . "
as for Ishmael , I have heard you . behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly . he will become the father of twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .
Abraham took Ishmael his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Abraham 's house , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day , as God had said to him .
he lifted up his eyes and looked , and saw that three men stood opposite him . when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself to the earth ,
the two angels came to Sodom at evening . lot sat in the gate of Sodom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bowed himself with his face to the earth ,
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
they called to lot , and said to him , " Where are the men who came in to you this night ? bring them out to us , that we may have sex with them . "
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
see now , your servant has found favor in your sight , and you have magnified your loving kindness , which you have shown to me in saving my life . I can 't escape to the mountain , lest evil overtake me , and I die .
see now , this city is near to flee to , and it is a little one . Oh let me escape there ( isn 't it a little one ? ) , and my soul will live . "
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived .
lot went up out of Zoar , and lived in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he was afraid to live in Zoar . he lived in a cave with his two daughters .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's seed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she arose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night , and said to him , " behold , you are a dead man , because of the woman whom you have taken . for she is a man 's wife . "
Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ear . the men were very scared .
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
it happened , when God caused me to wander from my father 's house , that I said to her , ' This is your kindness which you shall show to me . everywhere that we go , say of me , " He is my brother . " ' "
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
God said to Abraham , " Don 't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy , and because of your handmaid . in all that Sarah says to you , listen to her voice . for from Isaac will your seed be called .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bow shot away . for she said , " Don 't let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and wept .
God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hagar ? Don 't be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
so they made a Covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
he said , " Now take your son , your only son , whom you love , even Isaac , and go into the land of Moriah . offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of . "
Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
he said , " Don 't lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not withheld your son , your only son , from me . "
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
Abraham rose up from before his dead , and spoke to the children of Heth , saying ,
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying @-@ place . "
now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth . Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
" no , my lord , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bury your dead . "
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
I will make you swear by Yahweh , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I live .
if the woman isn 't willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
behold , I am standing by the spring of water . the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master . as for me , Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master 's relatives . "
the man came into the house , and he unloaded the camels . he gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
behold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the maiden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink , "
and she will tell me , " Drink , and I will also draw for your camels , " --let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master 's son . '
she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , ' Drink , and I will also give your camels a drink . ' so I drank , and she also gave the camels a drink .
I asked her , and said , ' whose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bore to him . ' I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her hands .
I bowed my head , and worshiped Yahweh , and blessed Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
they blessed Rebekah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them . "
Rebekah arose with her ladies . they rode on the camels , and followed the man . the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she dismounted from the Camel .
but to the sons of Abraham 's concubines , Abraham gave gifts . he sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , to the east country .
these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived : one hundred seventy @-@ five years .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bore to Abraham .
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
there was a famine in the land , besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines , to Gerar .
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father .
I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your seed all these lands . in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed ,
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was caressing Rebekah , his wife .
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
Isaac dug again the wells of water , which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father . for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham . he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
when Esau was forty years old , he took as wife Judith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
it happened , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his elder son , and said to him , " My son ? " he said to him , " Here I am . "
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau . "
he said , " Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
he came near , and kissed him . he smelled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him , and said , " behold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed .
let peoples serve you , and nations bow down to you . be lord over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bow down to you . Cursed be everyone who curses you . blessed be everyone who blesses you . "
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " bless me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac his father answered him , " behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
the words of Esau , her elder son , were told to Rebekah . she sent and called Jacob , her younger son , and said to him , " behold , your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep .
he dreamed . behold , a stairway set upon the earth , and its top reached to heaven . behold , the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
behold , Yahweh stood above it , and said , " I am Yahweh , the God of Abraham your father , and the God of Isaac . the land whereon you lie , to you will I give it , and to your seed .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
behold , I am with you , and will keep you , wherever you go , and will bring you again into this land . for I will not leave you , until I have done that which I have spoken of to you . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Bethel , but the name of the city was Luz at the first .
Jacob vowed a vow , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pillar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you . "
he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and , behold , three flocks of sheep lying there by it . for out of that well they watered the flocks . the stone on the well 's mouth was large .
there all the flocks were gathered . they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again on the well 's mouth in its place .
it happened , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Laban heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban all these things .
Jacob said to Laban , " Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
she conceived , bore a son , and said , " God has taken away my reproach . "
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
I will pass through all your flock today , removing from there every speckled and spotted one , and every black one among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats . this will be my hire .
that day , he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted , and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar , almond , plane tree , peeled white streaks in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban : and he put his own droves apart , and didn 't put them into Laban 's flock .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
Jacob saw the expression on Laban 's face , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
if he said this , ' The speckled will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore speckled . if he said this , ' The streaked will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore streaked .
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar , where you vowed a vow to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
and he took away all his livestock , and all his possessions which he had gathered , including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram , to go to Isaac his father , to the land of Canaan .
Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian , in that he didn 't tell him that he was running away .
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead .
why did you flee secretly , and deceive me , and didn 't tell me , that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs , with tambourine and with harp ;
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' Take heed to yourself that you don 't speak to Jacob either good or bad . '
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly longed for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my gods ? "
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the teraphim , put them in the Camel 's saddle , and sat on them . Laban felt about all the tent , but didn 't find them .
she said to her father , " Don 't let my lord be angry that I can 't rise up before you ; for I 'm having my period . " he searched , but didn 't find the teraphim .
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
that which was torn of animals , I didn 't bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
now come , let us make a Covenant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
if you afflict my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , no man is with us ; behold , God is witness between me and you . "
May this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jacob swore by the fear of his father , Isaac .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them . Laban departed and returned to his place .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
he commanded them , saying , " This is what you shall tell my lord , Esau : ' this is what your servant , Jacob , says . I have lived as a foreigner with Laban , and stayed until now .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your servant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
you said , ' I will surely do you good , and make your seed as the sand of the sea , which can 't be numbered because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded the foremost , saying , " When Esau , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your servant , Jacob 's . it is a present sent to my lord , Esau . behold , he also is behind us . ' "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
therefore the children of Israel don 't eat the sinew of the hip , which is on the hollow of the thigh , to this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew of the hip .
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Who are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has graciously given your servant . "
Leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Seir . "
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Dinah , the daughter of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the land , saw her . he took her , lay with her , and humbled her .
now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his livestock in the field . Jacob held his peace until they came .
and said to them , " We can 't do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised ; for that is a reproach to us .
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
Hamor and Shechem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circumcised , as they are circumcised .
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor , and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
they took their flocks , their herds , their donkeys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took captive all their little ones and their wives , and took as plunder everything that was in the house .
God said to Jacob , " arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands , and the rings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
so Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an altar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
the sons of Zilpah ( Leah 's handmaid ) : Gad and Asher . these are the sons of Jacob , who were born to him in Paddan Aram .
Isaac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . Esau and Jacob , his sons , buried him .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
Esau took his wives , his sons , his daughters , and all the members of his household , with his livestock , all his animals , and all his possessions , which he had gathered in the land of Canaan , and went into a land away from his brother Jacob .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together , and the land of their travels couldn 't bear them because of their livestock .
this is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir :
these are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah , the wife of Esau ; and Reuel , the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
chief Korah , chief Gatam , chief Amalek : these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Adah .
these are the sons of Reuel , Esau 's son : chief Nahath , chief Zerah , chief Shammah , chief Mizzah : these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Basemath , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
Dishon , Ezer , and Dishan . these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
these are the children of Zibeon : Aiah and Anah . this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness , as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father .
chief Dishon , chief Ezer , and chief Dishan : these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
Husham died , and Hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his place . the name of his city was Pau . his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Reuben said to them , " shed no blood . throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness , but lay no hand on him " --that he might deliver him out of their hand , to restore him to his father .
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
and they took him , and threw him into the pit . the pit was empty . there was no water in it .
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead , with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
Midianites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
Reuben returned to the pit ; and saw that Joseph wasn 't in the pit ; and he tore his clothes .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . he said , " For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning . " his father wept for him .
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
Onan knew that the seed wouldn 't be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
after many days , Shua 's daughter , the wife of Judah , died . Judah was comforted , and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah , he and his friend Hirah , the Adullamite .
it was told Tamar , saying , " behold , your father @-@ in @-@ law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . "
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
Joseph found favor in his sight . he ministered to him , and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he didn 't concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @-@ built and handsome .
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and had run outside ,
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yahweh was with Joseph , and showed kindness to him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dreamed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the cupbearer and the Baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , the way you did when you were his cupbearer .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you , and will hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief Baker among his servants .
behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , sleek and fat , and they fed in the marsh grass .
behold , seven other cattle came up after them out of the river , ugly and thin , and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sleek . they fed in the marsh grass ,
and behold , seven other cattle came up after them , poor and very ugly and thin , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness .
and when they had eaten them up , it couldn 't be known that they had eaten them , but they were still ugly , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain . I told it to the magicians , but there was no one who could explain it to me . "
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows ; for it will be very grievous .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plenteous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " behold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of plenty , that were in the land of Egypt , came to an end .
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
he said , " behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
but Jacob didn 't send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " Lest perhaps harm happen to him . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
by this you shall be tested . by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
Reuben answered them , saying , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' Don 't sin against the child , ' and you wouldn 't listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
he turned himself away from them , and wept . then he returned to them , and spoke to them , and took Simeon from among them , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
they came to Jacob their father , to the land of Canaan , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
" the man , the lord of the land , spoke roughly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
the man , the lord of the land , said to us , ' By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take grain for the famine of your houses , and go your way .
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not spies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
it happened as they emptied their sacks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
Jacob , their father , said to them , " You have bereaved me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Simeon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
Judah said to Israel , his father , " Send the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
I 'll be collateral for him . from my hand will you require him . if I don 't bring him to you , and set him before you , then let me bear the blame forever ,
and take double money in your hand , and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks . perhaps it was an oversight .
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
when we came to the lodging place , we opened our sacks , and behold , each man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet . he gave their donkeys fodder .
when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves down to him to the earth .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men marveled one with another .
he commanded the steward of his house , saying , " fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , with his grain money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their donkeys .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with whomever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondservants . "
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bondservant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Judah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don 't let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Pharaoh .
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don 't bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father forever . '
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy isn 't with me ? --lest I see the evil that will come on my father . "
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
so now it wasn 't you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , lord of all his house , and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall dwell in the land of Goshen , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your flocks , your herds , and all that you have .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
the report of it was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
now you are commanded : do this . take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they departed . he said to them , " See that you don 't quarrel on the way . "
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob , their father , revived .
Jacob rose up from Beersheba , and the sons of Israel carried Jacob , their father , their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
they took their livestock , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt--Jacob , and all his seed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to Rachel , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob : all the souls were seven .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
he sent Judah before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Goshen , and they came into the land of Goshen .
Joseph prepared his chariot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Goshen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Pharaoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Canaan , have come to me .
these men are shepherds , for they have been keepers of livestock , and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have . '
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians . "
then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their flocks , their herds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen . "
they said to Pharaoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants ' flocks . for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Give us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses , and for the flocks , and for the herds , and for the donkeys : and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
it will happen at the harvests , that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh , and four parts will be your own , for seed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
but when I sleep with my fathers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their burying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
and said to me , ' behold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh , even as Reuben and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath , and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it displeased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
boiling over as water , you shall not excel ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then defiled it . he went up to my couch .
my soul , don 't come into their council . my glory , don 't be united to their assembly ; for in their anger they killed men . in their self @-@ will they hamstrung cattle .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
Judah is a lion 's cub . from the prey , my son , you have gone up . he stooped down , he crouched as a lion , as a lioness . who will rouse him up ?
the scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obedience of the peoples be .
binding his foal to the vine , his donkey 's colt to the choice vine ; he has washed his garments in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
" Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea . he will be for a haven of ships . his border will be on Sidon .
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he bows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
but his bow remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob , ( from there is the shepherd , the stone of Israel ) ,
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors , above the boundaries of the ancient hills . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them . he blessed everyone according to his blessing .
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
when the days of weeping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
as for you , you meant evil against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
Joseph saw Ephraim 's children to the third generation . the children also of Machir , the son of Manasseh , were born on Joseph 's knees .
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and in brick , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ruthlessly made them serve .
the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew Midwives , of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah ,
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them on the birth stool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
she opened it , and saw the child , and behold , the baby cried . she had compassion on him , and said , " This is one of the Hebrews ' children . "
it happened in those days , when Moses had grown up , that he went out to his brothers , and looked at their burdens . he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew , one of his brothers .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
he went out the second day , and behold , two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other . he said to him who did the wrong , " Why do you strike your fellow ? "
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro , his father @-@ in @-@ law , the priest of Midian , and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness , and came to God 's mountain , to Horeb .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flowing with milk and honey ; to the place of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to Pharaoh , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Moses said to God , " Who am I , that I should go to Pharaoh , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
Moses said to God , " behold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
God said to Moses , " I AM WHO I AM , " and he said , " You shall tell the children of Israel this : ' I AM has sent me to you . ' "
God said moreover to Moses , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yahweh , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ' this is my name forever , and this is my memorial to all generations .
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , to a land flowing with milk and honey . " '
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @-@ handed .
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jewels of silver , jewels of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall plunder the Egyptians . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
Yahweh said furthermore to him , " Now put your hand inside your cloak . " he put his hand inside his cloak , and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous , as white as snow .
he said , " Put your hand inside your cloak again . " he put his hand inside his cloak again , and when he took it out of his cloak , behold , it had turned again as his other flesh .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and pour it on the dry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land . "
you shall speak to him , and put the words in his mouth . I will be with your mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what you shall do .
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
Yahweh said to Moses , " When you go back into Egypt , see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand , but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go .
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . behold , I will kill your son , your firstborn . ' "
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
let heavier work be laid on the men , that they may labor therein ; and don 't let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what Pharaoh says : ' I will not give you straw .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
no straw is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Make brick ! ' and behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks ! "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh , for by a strong hand he shall let them go , and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land . "
I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage , and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it to you for a heritage : I am Yahweh . ' "
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fathers ' houses . the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel : Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
" when Pharaoh speaks to you , saying , ' perform a miracle ! ' then you shall tell Aaron , ' Take your rod , and cast it down before Pharaoh , that it become a serpent . ' "
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and they did so , as Yahweh had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers . they also , the magicians of Egypt , did the same thing with their enchantments .
go to Pharaoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yahweh , " In this you shall know that I am Yahweh . behold , I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river . " ' "
Moses and Aaron did so , as Yahweh commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and he didn 't even take this to heart .
and the river shall swarm with frogs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bedroom , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ovens , and into your kneading troughs :
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , over the streams , and over the pools , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
the frogs shall depart from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite , he hardened his heart , and didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken .
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; behold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if you will not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth .
Yahweh did so ; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies .
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead . but the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , and he didn 't let the people go .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and tell him , ' This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for this time I will send all my plagues against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth ;
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens , and Yahweh sent Thunder , hail , and lightning flashed down to the earth . Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , there was no hail .
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh . the thunders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh 's .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yahweh . "
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and said to him , " This is what Yahweh , the God of the Hebrews , says : ' how long will you refuse to humble yourself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country ,
and they shall cover the surface of the earth , so that one won 't be able to see the earth . they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; as neither your fathers nor your fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were on the earth to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from Pharaoh .
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the locusts , and drove them into the Red Sea . there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
they didn 't see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will surely thrust you out altogether .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let them ask every man of his neighbor , and every woman of her neighbor , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold . "
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won 't even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
speak to all the Congregation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to their fathers ' houses , a lamb for a household ;
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old . you shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the flesh in that night , roasted with fire , and unleavened bread . they shall eat it with bitter herbs .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Yahweh .
" ' seven days you shall eat unleavened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leavened , that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the basin , and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two doorposts , Yahweh will pass over the door , and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yahweh 's Passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyptians , and spared our houses . ' " the people bowed their heads and worshiped .
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
it happened at midnight , that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing .
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it wasn 't leavened , because they were thrust out of Egypt , and couldn 't wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yahweh , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
but every man 's servant who is bought for money , when you have circumcised him , then shall he eat of it .
in one house shall it be eaten ; you shall not carry out anything of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall you break a bone of it .
Moses said to the people , " Remember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place . no leavened bread shall be eaten .
it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Amorite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite , which he swore to your fathers to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days ; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall yeast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt .
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons .
it shall be , when your son asks you in time to come , saying , ' What is this ? ' that you shall tell him , ' By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bondage ;
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
the pillar of cloud by day , and the pillar of fire by night , didn 't depart from before the people .
I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and he will follow after them ; and I will get honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies ; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh . " they did so .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cried out to Yahweh .
they said to Moses , " Because there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the wilderness ? why have you treated us this way , to bring us out of Egypt ?
Isn 't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Leave us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness . "
Moses said to the people , " Don 't be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Yahweh , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh , and over all his armies , over his chariots , and over his horsemen .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh , and said , " I will sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
with the blast of your nostrils , the waters were piled up . the floods stood upright as a heap . the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will overtake . I will divide the spoil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them . '
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed . Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab . all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away .
terror and dread falls on them . by the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over , Yahweh , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Yahweh , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
then he cried to Yahweh . Yahweh showed him a tree , and he threw it into the waters , and the waters were made sweet . there he made a statute and an ordinance for them , and there he tested them ;
they took their journey from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness ;
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
" I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel . speak to them , saying , ' At evening you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread : and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God . ' "
it happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the Frost on the ground .
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they didn 't know what it was . Moses said to them , " It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat . "
when they measured it with an Omer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they didn 't listen to Moses , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and became foul : and Moses was angry with them .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
all the Congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Walk on before the people , and take the elders of Israel with you , and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile , and go .
behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
so Joshua did as Moses had told him , and fought with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua : that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky . "
now Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the Mountain of God .
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro said , " blessed be Yahweh , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God . Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law before God .
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
you shall teach them the statutes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God : men of truth , hating unjust gain ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
when they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the wilderness of Sinai , they encamped in the wilderness ; and there Israel encamped before the mountain .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians , and how I bore you on eagles ' wings , and brought you to myself .
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my Covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don 't go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet ; and all the people who were in the camp trembled .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
Yahweh said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don 't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh , lest he break forth on them . "
" I am Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
" you shall not make for yourselves an idol , nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow yourself down to them , nor serve them , for I , Yahweh your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ,
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God . you shall not do any work in it , you , nor your son , nor your daughter , your male servant , nor your female servant , nor your livestock , nor your stranger who is within your gates ;
" you shall not covet your neighbor 's house . you shall not covet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his donkey , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
Yahweh said to Moses , " This is what you shall tell the children of Israel : ' you yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
you shall make an altar of earth for me , and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings , your sheep and your cattle . in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you .
if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have polluted it .
if he comes in by himself , he shall go out by himself . if he is married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
if she doesn 't please her master , who has married her to himself , then he shall let her be redeemed . he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people , since he has dealt deceitfully with her .
if he rises again and walks around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed .
" if a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod , and he dies under his hand , he shall surely be punished .
" if a man strikes his servant 's eye , or his maid 's eye , and destroys it , he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if he strikes out his male servant 's tooth , or his female servant 's tooth , he shall let him go free for his tooth 's sake .
" if a bull gores a man or a woman to death , the bull shall surely be stoned , and its flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible .
but if the bull had a habit of goring in the past , and it has been testified to its owner , and he has not kept it in , but it has killed a man or a woman , the bull shall be stoned , and its owner shall also be put to death .
" if one man 's bull injures another 's , so that it dies , then they shall sell the live bull , and divide its price ; and they shall also divide the dead animal .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
" if a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten , and lets his animal loose , and it grazes in another man 's field , he shall make restitution from the best of his own field , and from the best of his own vineyard .
" if fire breaks out , and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain , or the standing grain , or the field are consumed ; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both , whether he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods ; and its owner shall accept it , and he shall not make restitution .
" if a man borrows anything of his neighbor 's , and it is injured , or dies , its owner not being with it , he shall surely make restitution .
" if a man entices a virgin who isn 't pledged to be married , and lies with her , he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife .
if you take advantage of them at all , and they cry at all to me , I will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath will grow hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
" if you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor , you shall not be to him as a creditor ; neither shall you charge him interest .
if you take your neighbor 's garment as collateral , you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down ,
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the firstborn of your sons to me .
you shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep . seven days it shall be with its mother , then on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
" you shall not follow a crowd to do evil ; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice ;
" six days you shall do your work , and on the seventh day you shall rest , that your ox and your donkey may have rest , and the son of your handmaid , and the alien may be refreshed .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don 't invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ( for in it you came out from Egypt ) , and no one shall appear before me empty .
the first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk .
" behold , I send an angel before you , to keep you by the way , and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
pay attention to him , and listen to his voice . Don 't provoke him , for he will not pardon your disobedience , for my name is in him .
but if you indeed listen to his voice , and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and an adversary to your adversaries .
for my angel shall go before you , and bring you in to the Amorite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I will cut them off .
you shall serve Yahweh your God , and he will bless your bread and your water , and I will take sickness away from your midst .
I will send my terror before you , and will confuse all the people to whom you come , and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you .
I will send the hornet before you , which will drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before you .
I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines , and from the wilderness to the River ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and you shall drive them out before you .
they shall not dwell in your land , lest they make you sin against me , for if you serve their gods , it will surely be a snare to you . "
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins , and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
he took the book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yahweh has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Moses took the blood , and sprinkled it on the people , and said , " Look , this is the blood of the Covenant , which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words . "
he didn 't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel . they saw God , and ate and drank .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Come up to me on the mountain , and stay here , and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written , that you may teach them . "
the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .
" speak to the children of Israel , that they take an offering for me . from everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall take my offering .
according to all that I show you , the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all of its furniture , even so you shall make it .
" they shall make an Ark of acacia wood . its length shall be two and a half cubits , its breadth a cubit and a half , and a cubit and a half its height .
you shall overlay it with pure gold . you shall overlay it inside and outside , and you shall make a gold molding around it .
you shall cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in its four feet . two rings shall be on the one side of it , and two rings on the other side of it .
the poles shall be in the rings of the Ark . they shall not be taken from it .
make one cherub at the one end , and one cherub at the other end . you shall make the cherubim on its two ends of one piece with the mercy seat .
the cherubim shall spread out their wings upward , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat .
you shall put the mercy seat on top of the Ark , and in the Ark you shall put the testimony that I will give you .
" you shall make a table of acacia wood . two cubits shall be its length , and a cubit its breadth , and one and a half cubits its height .
you shall make a rim of a handbreadth around it . you shall make a golden molding on its rim around it .
you shall make four rings of gold for it , and put the rings in the four corners that are on its four feet .
you shall make the poles of acacia wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be carried with them .
you shall make its dishes , its spoons , its ladles , and its bowls to pour out offerings with . you shall make them of pure gold .
" you shall make a lampstand of pure gold . of hammered work shall the lampstand be made , even its base , its Shaft , its cups , its buds , and its flowers , shall be of one piece with it .

Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
all the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them to Aaron .
he received what they handed him , and fashioned it with an engraving tool , and made it a molten calf ; and they said , " These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they rose up early on the next day , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " Go , get down ; for your people , who you brought up out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves !
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them . they have made themselves a molten calf , and have worshiped it , and have sacrificed to it , and said , ' These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
Moses begged Yahweh his God , and said , " Yahweh , why does your wrath burn hot against your people , that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand ?
why should the Egyptians speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for evil , to kill them in the mountains , and to consume them from the surface of the earth ? ' turn from your fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against your people .
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , engraved on the tables .
he said , " It isn 't the voice of those who shout for victory , neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome ; but the noise of those who sing that I hear . "
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the calf and the dancing : and Moses ' anger grew hot , and he threw the tablets out of his hands , and broke them beneath the mountain .
he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it with fire , ground it to powder , and scattered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' Whoever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this calf . "
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , " Whoever is on Yahweh 's side , come to me ! " all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him .
he said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his sword on his thigh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbor . ' "
it happened on the next day , that Moses said to the people , " You have sinned a great sin . now I will go up to Yahweh . perhaps I shall make Atonement for your sin . "
yet now , if you will , forgive their sin--and if not , please blot me out of your book which you have written . "
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , " depart , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . '
now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meeting . " it happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of Meeting , which was outside the camp .
it happened that when Moses went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the tent .
it happened , when Moses entered into the tent , that the pillar of cloud descended , stood at the door of the tent , and spoke with Moses .
all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and worshiped , everyone at their tent door .
Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his servant Joshua , the son of nun , a young man , didn 't depart out of the tent .
now therefore , if I have found favor in your sight , please show me now your ways , that I may know you , so that I may find favor in your sight : and consider that this nation is your people . "
he said , " I will make all my Goodness pass before you , and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you . I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy . "
it will happen , while my glory passes by , that I will put you in a cleft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back ; but my face shall not be seen . "
be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain .
he chiseled two tablets of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount Sinai , as Yahweh had commanded him , and took in his hand two stone tablets .
keeping loving kindness for thousands , forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the children 's children , on the third and on the fourth generation . "
observe that which I command you this day . behold , I drive out before you the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
be careful , lest you make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a snare in the midst of you :
but you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and you shall cut down their Asherim ;
" Don 't make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land , lest they play the prostitute after their gods , and sacrifice to their gods , and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice ;
and you take of their daughters to your sons , and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods , and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods .
" you shall keep the feast of unleavened bread . seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the time appointed in the month Abib ; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt .
the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb : and if you will not redeem it , then you shall break its neck . all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem . no one shall appear before me empty .
" you shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of harvest at the year 's end .
for I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning .
" you shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk . "
it happened , when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Moses didn 't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
afterward all the children of Israel came near , and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai .
but when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
the children of Israel saw Moses ' face , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
Moses assembled all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and said to them , " These are the words which Yahweh has commanded , that you should do them .
'Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you , a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh : whoever does any work in it shall be put to death .
Moses spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh commanded , saying ,
and the altar of incense with its poles , the anointing oil , the sweet incense , the screen for the door , at the door of the tabernacle ;
the finely worked garments , for ministering in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office . ' "
they came , everyone whose heart stirred him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Yahweh 's offering , for the work of the tent of Meeting , and for all of its service , and for the holy garments .
everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought Yahweh 's offering ; and everyone , with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service , brought it .
all the women who were wise @-@ hearted spun with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , the blue , the purple , the scarlet , and the fine linen .
the rulers brought the onyx stones , and the stones to be set , for the ephod and for the breastplate ;
the children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses .
he has put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab , and every wise @-@ hearted man , in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom , even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it :
they spoke to Moses , saying , " The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make . "

a Beka a head , that is , half a shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered , from twenty years old and upward , for six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men .
the one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the veil ; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
of the one thousand seven hundred seventy @-@ five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , overlaid their capitals , and made fillets for them .
they beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , in the purple , in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , the work of the skillful workman .
they made shoulder straps for it , joined together . at the two ends it was joined together .
the skillfully woven band that was on it , with which to fasten it on , was of the same piece , like its work ; of gold , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
they worked the onyx stones , enclosed in settings of gold , engraved with the engravings of a signet , according to the names of the children of Israel .
he put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod , to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he made the breastplate , the work of a skillful workman , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen .
the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names ; like the engravings of a signet , everyone according to his name , for the twelve tribes .
the other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the two settings , and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod , in its front .
they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , on its edge , which was toward the side of the ephod inward .
they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod underneath , in its front , close by its coupling , above the skillfully woven band of the ephod .
they bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the opening of the robe in its midst was like the opening of a coat of mail , with a binding around its opening , that it should not be torn .
they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote on it a writing , like the engravings of a signet : " Holy TO YAHWEH . "
thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of Meeting was finished . the children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses ; so they did .
Moses saw all the work , and behold , they had done it as Yahweh had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .

it happened in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was raised up .
Moses raised up the tabernacle , and laid its sockets , and set up its boards , and put in its bars , and raised up its pillars .
he took and put the testimony into the Ark , and set the poles on the Ark , and put the mercy seat above on the Ark .
he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the veil of the screen , and screened the Ark of the testimony , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he put the table in the tent of Meeting , on the side of the tabernacle northward , outside of the veil .
he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of Meeting , and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
when they went into the tent of Meeting , and when they came near to the altar , they washed , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the screen of the gate of the court . so Moses finished the work .
Moses wasn 't able to enter into the tent of Meeting , because the cloud stayed on it , and Yahweh 's glory filled the tabernacle .
when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward , throughout all their journeys ;
but if the cloud wasn 't taken up , then they didn 't travel until the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day , and there was fire in the cloud by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .

the children of Israel did so , and put them out outside of the camp ; as Yahweh spoke to Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then he shall confess his sin which he has done , and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full , and add to it the fifth part of it , and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty .
every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present to the priest , shall be his .
and a man lies with her carnally , and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband , and is kept close , and she is defiled , and there is no witness against her , and she isn 't taken in the act ;
and the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is Jealous of his wife , and she is defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him , and he is Jealous of his wife , and she isn 't defiled :
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest , and shall bring her offering for her : the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal . he shall pour no oil on it , nor put frankincense on it , for it is a meal offering of jealousy , a meal offering of memorial , bringing iniquity to memory .
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water .
the priest shall set the woman before Yahweh , and let the hair of the woman 's head go loose , and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands , which is the meal offering of jealousy . the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse .
but if you have gone astray , being under your husband , and if you are defiled , and some man has lain with you besides your husband : "
and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels , and make your body swell , and your thigh fall away . " the woman shall say , " Amen , Amen . "
" ' the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness .
he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse ; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter .
the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh , and bring it to the altar .
the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering , as its memorial , and burn it on the altar , and afterward shall make the woman drink the water .
or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man , and he is Jealous of his wife ; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh , and the priest shall execute on her all this law .
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink . he shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of fermented drink , neither shall he drink any juice of grapes , nor eat fresh grapes or dried .
all the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine , from the seeds even to the skins .
" ' all the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head , until the days are fulfilled , in which he separates himself to Yahweh . he shall be holy . he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long .
he shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die ; because his separation to God is on his head .
" ' if any man dies very suddenly beside him , and he defiles the head of his separation ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing . on the seventh day he shall shave it .
on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest , to the door of the tent of Meeting .
the priest shall offer one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make Atonement for him , because he sinned by reason of the dead , and shall make his head holy that same day .
he shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation , and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering ; but the former days shall be void , because his separation was defiled .
" ' this is the law of the Nazirite : when the days of his separation are fulfilled , he shall be brought to the door of the tent of Meeting ,
and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh , one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh , with the basket of unleavened bread . the priest shall offer also its meal offering , and its drink offering .
the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of Meeting , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings .
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh . this is holy for the priest , together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered . after that the Nazirite may drink wine .
" speak to Aaron and to his sons , saying , ' This is how you shall bless the children of Israel . ' you shall tell them ,
it happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle , and had anointed it and sanctified it , with all its furniture , and the altar with all its vessels , and had anointed and sanctified them ;
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but to the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them ; they carried it on their shoulders .
the princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes gave their offerings before the altar .
he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah ,

the twelve golden ladles , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; all the gold of the ladles weighed one hundred twenty shekels ;
and all the cattle for the sacrifice of peace offerings twenty @-@ four bulls , the rams sixty , the male goats sixty , the male lambs a year old sixty . this was the dedication of the altar , after it was anointed .
" speak to Aaron , and tell him , ' When you light the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand . ' "
this was the workmanship of the lampstand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh .
" the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls , and you shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh , to make Atonement for the Levites .
you shall set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh .
" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the womb , even the firstborn of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
Moses , and Aaron , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the children of Israel did to them .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made Atonement for them to cleanse them .
after that , the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of Meeting before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
" this is that which belongs to the Levites : from twenty @-@ five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meeting ;
but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
on the fourteenth day of this month , at evening , you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes , and according to all its ordinances , you shall keep it . "
they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the wilderness of Sinai . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
those men said to him , " We are unclean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "
in the second month , on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it ; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
but the man who is clean , and is not on a journey , and fails to keep the Passover , that soul shall be cut off from his people . because he didn 't offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
on the day that the tabernacle was raised up , the cloud covered the tabernacle , even the tent of the testimony : and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until morning .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
at the commandment of Yahweh , the children of Israel traveled , and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped . as long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped .
when the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept Yahweh 's command , and didn 't travel .
" make two trumpets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Congregation , and for the journeying of the camps .
but when the assembly is to be gathered together , you shall blow , but you shall not sound an alarm .
when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you , then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets . then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God , and you will be saved from your enemies .
it happened in the second year , in the second month , on the twentieth day of the month , that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies . Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army .
the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari , who bore the tabernacle , went forward .
the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies . Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the rear guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army .
Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yahweh does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the Ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in mortars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it . its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly ; and Moses was displeased .
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they weep to me , saying , ' Give us meat , that we may eat . '
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the tent of Meeting , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spirit which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yourself alone .
but a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it is loathsome to you ; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you , and have wept before him , saying , " Why did we come out of Egypt ? " ' "
shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Moses went out , and told the people the words of Yahweh ; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them around the tent .
Yahweh came down in the cloud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spirit that was on him , and put it on the seventy elders : and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them , they prophesied , but they did so no more .
but two men remained in the camp . the name of one was Eldad , and the name of the other Medad : and the Spirit rested on them ; and they were of those who were written , but had not gone out to the tent ; and they prophesied in the camp .
a wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cubits above the surface of the earth .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the quails . he who gathered least gathered ten homers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a Cushite woman .
now the man Moses was very humble , above all the men who were on the surface of the earth .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
he said , " Hear now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in riddles ; and he shall see Yahweh 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
Aaron said to Moses , " Oh , my lord , please don 't count this sin against us , in which we have done foolishly , and in which we have sinned .
let her not , I pray , be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother 's womb . "
Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they dwell in , whether in camps , or in strongholds ;
they went up by the South , and came to Hebron ; and Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were there . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
that place was called the valley of Eshcol , because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there .
they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word to them , and to all the Congregation , and showed them the fruit of the land .
Amalek dwells in the land of the South : and the Hittite , and the Jebusite , and the Amorite , dwell in the hill country ; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea , and along by the side of the Jordan . "
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
and they spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " The land , which we passed through to spy it out , is an exceeding good land .
if Yahweh delights in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it to us ; a land which flows with milk and honey .
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the Congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
'Yahweh is slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , forgiving iniquity and disobedience ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation . '
please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness , and according as you have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . "
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers , neither shall any of those who despised me see it :
but my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and has followed me fully , him will I bring into the land into which he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley : tomorrow turn , and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness ; and all who were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , who have murmured against me ,
surely you shall not come into the land , concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
but your little ones , that you said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which you have rejected .
after the number of the days in which you spied out the land , even forty days , for every day a year , you will bear your iniquities , even forty years , and you will know my alienation . '
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil Congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land .
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " behold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised : for we have sinned . "
for there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you , and you shall fall by the sword : because you are turned back from following Yahweh , therefore Yahweh will not be with you . "
but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and Moses , didn 't depart out of the camp .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or as a freewill offering , or in your set feasts , to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh , of the herd , or of the flock ;
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil :
and wine for the drink offering , the fourth part of a hin , you shall prepare with the burnt offering , or for the sacrifice , for each lamb .
" ' or for a ram , you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil :
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vow , or for peace offerings to Yahweh ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil :
thus shall it be done for each bull , or for each ram , or for each of the male lambs , or of the young goats .
" ' all who are native @-@ born shall do these things in this way , in offering an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh .
if a stranger lives as a foreigner with you , or whoever may be among you throughout your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh ; as you do , so he shall do .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land where I bring you ,
then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land , you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh .
of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering : as the wave offering of the threshing floor , so you shall heave it .
then it shall be , if it be done unwittingly , without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering , for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh , with the meal offering of it , and the drink offering of it , according to the ordinance , and one male goat for a sin offering .
the priest shall make Atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and they shall be forgiven ; for it was an error , and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire to Yahweh , and their sin offering before Yahweh , for their error :
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven , and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them ; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly .
the priest shall make Atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make Atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
you shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly , for him who is native @-@ born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them .
" ' but the soul who does anything with a high hand , whether he is native @-@ born or a foreigner , the same blasphemes Yahweh ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
they put him in custody , because it had not been declared what should be done to him .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
and it shall be to you for a fringe , that you may look on it , and remember all the commandments of Yahweh , and do them ; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes , after which you use to play the prostitute ;
and he spoke to Korah and to all his company , saying , " In the morning Yahweh will show who are his , and who is holy , and will cause him to come near to him : even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him .
and put fire in them , and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Levi ! "
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
moreover you haven 't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : will you put out the eyes of these men ? we won 't come up . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
so they went away from the tent of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood at the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
but if Yahweh make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain to them , and they go down alive into Sheol ; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh . "
it happened , as he made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground split apart that was under them ;
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
" speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter the fire yonder ; for they are holy ,
but on the next day all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , " You have killed Yahweh 's people ! "
it happened , when the Congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made Atonement for the people .
now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , besides those who died about the matter of Korah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Levi ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
it shall happen , that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against you . "
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
it happened on the next day , that Moses went into the tent of the testimony ; and behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded , and put forth buds , and produced blossoms , and bore ripe almonds .
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the tent of Meeting , for all the service of the tent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
" you shall perform the duty of the sanctuary , and the duty of the altar ; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yahweh , to do the service of the tent of Meeting .
Yahweh spoke to Aaron , " I , behold , I have given you the command of my wave offerings , even all the holy things of the children of Israel ; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to your sons , as a portion forever .
this shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire : every offering of theirs , even every meal offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render to me , shall be most holy for you and for your sons .
" all the best of the oil , and all the best of the vintage , and of the grain , the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh , to you have I given them .
the first @-@ ripe fruits of all that is in their land , which they bring to Yahweh , shall be yours ; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it .
you shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five shekels of money , after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty gerahs ) .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
" to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the tent of Meeting .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
for the tithe of the children of Israel , which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh , I have given to the Levites for an inheritance : therefore I have said to them , ' Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance . ' "
" moreover you shall speak to the Levites , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh , a tithe of the tithe .
your wave offering shall be reckoned to you , as though it were the grain of the threshing floor , and as the fullness of the winepress .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Yahweh 's wave offering to Aaron the priest .
out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh , of all its best , even the holy part of it out of it . '
" therefore you shall tell them , ' When you heave its best from it , then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor , and as the increase of the winepress .
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of Meeting .
you shall bear no sin by reason of it , when you have heaved from it its best : and you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , that you not die . ' "
" this is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red heifer without spot , in which is no blemish , and which was never yoked .
you shall give her to Eleazar the priest , and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp , and one shall kill her before his face :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her Dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the evening .
he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the evening : and it shall be to the children of Israel , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them , for a statute forever .
the same shall purify himself with water on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he doesn 't purify himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
" this is the law when a man dies in a tent : everyone who comes into the tent , and everyone who is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify him ; and he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at evening .
but the man who shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly , because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh : the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him ; he is unclean .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month : and the people stayed in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
why have you made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in to this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink . "
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .
Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron , " Because you didn 't believe in me , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them . "
how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we lived in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us , and our fathers :
and when we cried to Yahweh , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt : and behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of your border .
they traveled from Kadesh : and the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , came to Mount Hor .
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah .
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them on Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
they traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
the people came to Moses , and said , " We have sinned , because we have spoken against Yahweh , and against you . pray to Yahweh , that he take away the Serpents from us . " Moses prayed for the people .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Make a fiery serpent , and set it on a standard : and it shall happen , that everyone who is bitten , when he sees it , shall live . "
Moses made a serpent of brass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he looked to the serpent of brass , he lived .
from there they traveled , and encamped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness , that comes out of the border of the Amorites : for the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
the well , which the princes dug , which the nobles of the people dug , with the scepter , and with their poles . " from the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah ;
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks down on the desert .
" let me pass through your land : we will not turn aside into field , or into vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's highway , until we have passed your border . "
Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , even to the children of Ammon ; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
Israel took all these cities : and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all its towns .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Arnon .
for a fire has gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon . it has devoured Ar of Moab , The lords of the high places of the Arnon .
they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
Moab was very afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
the princes of Moab rose up , and they went to Balak , and said , " Balaam refuses to come with us . "
God came to Balaam at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
God 's anger was kindled because he went ; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the donkey turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the way .
then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the angel of Yahweh went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh , and she lay down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
and the donkey saw me , and turned aside before me these three times . unless she had turned aside from me , surely now I would have killed you , and saved her alive . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
when Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is in the utmost part of the border .
Balak said to Balaam , " Didn 't I earnestly send to you to call you ? why didn 't you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
Balaam said to Balak , " behold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "
it happened in the morning , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal ; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people .
for from the top of the rocks I see him . from the hills I see him . behold , it is a people that dwells alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
God is not a man , that he should lie , nor the son of man , that he should repent . has he said , and will he not do it ? or has he spoken , and will he not make it good ?
behold , the people rises up as a lioness , As a lion he lifts himself up . he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drinks the blood of the slain . "
when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel , he didn 't go , as at the other times , to meet with enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
water shall flow from his buckets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Agag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brings him out of Egypt . he has as it were the strength of the wild ox . he shall eat up the nations his adversaries , shall break their bones in pieces , and Pierce them with his arrows .
Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he struck his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , " I called you to curse my enemies , and , behold , you have altogether blessed them these three times .
now , behold , I go to my people : come , I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days . "
he says , who hears the words of God , knows the knowledge of the Most High , and who sees the vision of the Almighty , Falling down , and having his eyes open :
I see him , but not now . I see him , but not near . a star will come out of Jacob . a scepter will rise out of Israel , and shall strike through the corners of Moab , and break down all the sons of Sheth .
he looked at Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , " Amalek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
he looked at the Kenite , and took up his parable , and said , " Your dwelling place is strong . your nest is set in the rock .
but ships shall come from the coast of Kittim . they shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber . he also shall come to destruction . "
behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , while they were weeping at the door of the tent of Meeting .
when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from the midst of the Congregation , and took a spear in his hand ;
and it shall be to him , and to his seed after him , the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was Jealous for his God , and made Atonement for the children of Israel . ' "
now the name of the man of Israel that was slain , who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a fathers ' house among the Simeonites .
the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head of the people of a fathers ' house in Midian .
Reuben , the firstborn of Israel ; the sons of Reuben : of Hanoch , the family of the Hanochites ; of Pallu , the family of the Palluites ;
these are the families of the Reubenites ; and those who were numbered of them were forty @-@ three thousand seven hundred thirty .
the sons of Eliab : Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . these are that Dathan and Abiram , who were called of the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against Yahweh ,
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died ; what time the fire devoured two hundred fifty men , and they became a sign .

the sons of Manasseh : of Machir , the family of the Machirites ; and Machir became the father of Gilead ; of Gilead , the family of the Gileadites .
Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these are the families of Manasseh ; and those who were numbered of them were fifty @-@ two thousand seven hundred .
these are the sons of Ephraim after their families : of Shuthelah , the family of the Shuthelahites ; of Becher , the family of the Becherites ; of Tahan , the family of the Tahanites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those who were numbered of them , thirty @-@ two thousand five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .

these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
these are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites ; of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites ; of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
these are the families of Levi : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korahites . Kohath became the father of Amram .
the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , who was born to Levi in Egypt : and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
those who were numbered of them were twenty @-@ three thousand , every male from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
" the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
if he has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his father 's brothers .
because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes . " ( these are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . )
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the Congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the Congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation . "
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' My offering , my food for my offerings made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to me , you shall observe to offer to me in their due season . '
you shall tell them , ' This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh : male lambs a year old without blemish , two day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
you shall offer the one lamb in the morning , and you shall offer the other lamb at evening ;
its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb . you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place .
" ' on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish , and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , and the drink offering of it :
and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull , and the third part of a hin for the ram , and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
but you shall offer an offering made by fire , a burnt offering to Yahweh : two young bulls , and one ram , and seven male lambs a year old ; they shall be to you without blemish ;
in this way you shall offer daily , for seven days , the food of the offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
" ' also in the day of the first fruits , when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work ;
besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , you shall offer them ( they shall be to you without blemish ) , and their drink offerings .
" ' in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you .
" ' on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation ; and you shall afflict your souls : you shall do no kind of work ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls , for the rams , and for the lambs , according to their number , after the ordinance ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering , an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh : one bull , one ram , seven male lambs a year old without blemish ;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull , for the ram , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the ordinance :
" ' you shall offer these to Yahweh in your set feasts , besides your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meal offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings . ' "
Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded .
when a man vows a vow to Yahweh , or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond , he shall not break his word ; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth .
" also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh , and binds herself by a bond , being in her father 's house , in her youth ,
and her father hears her vow , and her bond with which she has bound her soul , and her father holds his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her father disallow her in the day that he hears , none of her vows , or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul , shall stand : and Yahweh will forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
" if she has a husband , while her vows are on her , or the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul ,
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it , then he shall make void her vow which is on her , and the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul : and Yahweh will forgive her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and didn 't disallow her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them , then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband has made them void ; and Yahweh will forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day , then he establishes all her vows , or all her bonds , which are on her : he has established them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
these are the statutes , which Yahweh commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain : Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , the five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their flocks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the Congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan at Jericho .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the Congregation of Yahweh .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
as to every garment , and all that is made of skin , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood , you shall purify yourselves . "
you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and afterward you shall come into the camp . "
" take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Eleazar the priest , and the heads of the fathers ' households of the Congregation ;
and divide the prey into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Congregation .
levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys , and of the flocks .
now the prey , over and above the booty which the men of war took , was six hundred seventy @-@ five thousand sheep ,
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the Levites , who performed the duty of the tabernacle of Yahweh ; as Yahweh commanded Moses .
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands , and the captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
and they said to Moses , " Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that behold , the place was a place for livestock ;
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , " shall your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
so Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fathers ' households of the tribes of the children of Israel .
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
Moses gave to them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .
the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
they traveled from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians ,
they traveled from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
they traveled from before Hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and encamped in Marah .
they traveled from Marah , and came to Elim : and in Elim were twelve springs of water , and seventy palm trees ; and they encamped there .
they traveled from Kadesh , and encamped in Mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides , and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Canaan ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders ) ,
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass along to Zin ; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar , and pass along to Azmon ;
and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
" ' this shall be your north border : from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor ;
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad ;
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers ' houses , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers ' houses , have received , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have received , their inheritance :
" these are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun .
of the children of Joseph : of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty @-@ eight cities together with their suburbs .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
or in enmity struck him with his hand , so that he died ; he who struck him shall surely be put to death ; he is a murderer : the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meets him .
or with any stone , by which a man may die , not seeing him , and cast it on him , so that he died , and he was not his enemy , neither sought his harm ;
and the Congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
" ' but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge , where he flees ,
and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
" ' moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death ; but he shall surely be put to death .
" ' you shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge , that he may come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
" ' so you shall not pollute the land in which you are : for blood , it pollutes the land ; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him who shed it .
the heads of the fathers ' households of the family of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Moses , and before the princes , the heads of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel :
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance . "
the daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses :
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
it happened in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them ;
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give to them and to their seed after them . "
Yahweh your God has multiplied you , and behold , you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude .
Yahweh , the God of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and bless you , as he has promised you !
you answered me , and said , " The thing which you have spoken is good to do . "
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
behold , Yahweh your God has set the land before you : go up , take possession , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has spoken to you ; don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the valley of Eshcol , and spied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
and you murmured in your tents , and said , " Because Yahweh hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cloud by day .
Joshua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a prey , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or evil , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
so I spoke to you , and you didn 't listen ; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh , and were presumptuous , and went up into the hill country .
the Amorites , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and beat you down in Seir , even to Hormah .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
Yahweh spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
Don 't contend with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on ; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Arnon : behold , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of you . "
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was not a city too high for us ; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us :
only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn 't come near ; all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country , and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
Yahweh said to me , " Don 't fear him ; for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into your hand ; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . "
we took all his cities at that time ; there was not a city which we didn 't take from them ; sixty cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
but all the livestock , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
( for only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; isn 't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was its length , and four cubits its breadth , after the cubit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , gave I to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , even all Bashan . ( the same is called the land of Rephaim .
to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon , the middle of the valley , and its border , even to the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
the Arabah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
I commanded you at that time , saying , " Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it : you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel , all the men of valor .
I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , " Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over .
" Lord Yahweh , you have begun to show your servant your greatness , and your strong hand : for what god is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to your works , and according to your mighty acts ?
go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up your eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
behold , I have taught you statutes and ordinances , even as Yahweh my God commanded me , that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it .
only take heed to yourself , and keep your soul diligently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it .
take therefore good heed to yourselves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire .
but Yahweh has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inheritance , as at this day .
furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance :
take heed to yourselves , lest you forget the Covenant of Yahweh your God , which he made with you , and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you .
Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples , and you shall be left few in number among the nations , where Yahweh shall lead you away .
but from there you shall seek Yahweh your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul .
when you are in oppression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yahweh your God is a merciful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the Covenant of your fathers which he swore to them .
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
because he loved your fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought you out with his presence , with his great power , out of Egypt ;
that the manslayer might flee there , who kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Moses spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
Yahweh didn 't make this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an engraved image for yourself , any likeness of what is in heaven above , or what is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
you shall not bow down yourself to them , nor serve them ; for I , Yahweh , your God , am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me ;
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm : therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
" honor your father and your mother , as Yahweh your God commanded you ; that your days may be long , and that it may go well with you , in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
" neither shall you covet your neighbor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neighbor 's house , his field , or his male servant , or his female servant , his ox , or his donkey , or anything that is your neighbor 's . "
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and you said , " behold , Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all flesh , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
go near , and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say : and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
Yahweh heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yahweh said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
Oh that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children forever !
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
now this is the commandment , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it ;
that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with you , and that you may increase mightily , as Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has promised to you , in a land flowing with milk and honey .
and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your might .
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimonies , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were Pharaoh 's bondservants in Egypt : and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand ;
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore to our fathers .
and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you , and you shall strike them ; then you shall utterly destroy them : you shall make no Covenant with them , nor show mercy to them ;
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
but because Yahweh loves you , and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers , has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
know therefore that Yahweh your God , he is God , the faithful God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ,
and repays those who hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him who hates him , he will repay him to his face .
it shall happen , because you listen to these ordinances , and keep and do them , that Yahweh your God will keep with you the Covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers :
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a snare to you .
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , perish from before you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consume them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers .
a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills you may dig copper .
beware lest you forget Yahweh your God , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have eaten and are full , and have built goodly houses , and lived therein ;
and when your herds and your flocks multiply , and your silver and your gold is multiplied , and all that you have is multiplied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery Serpents and Scorpions , and thirsty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna , which your fathers didn 't know ; that he might humble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his Covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
as the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you , so you shall perish ; because you wouldn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Who can stand before the sons of Anak ? "
remember , don 't forget , how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebellious against Yahweh .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which Yahweh made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
Yahweh said to me , " arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image . "
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you . but Yahweh listened to me that time also .
when Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea , saying , " Go up and possess the land which I have given you " ; then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God , and you didn 't believe him , nor listen to his voice .
I prayed to Yahweh , and said , " Lord Yahweh , don 't destroy your people and your inheritance , that you have redeemed through your greatness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
remember your servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; don 't look to the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
lest the land you brought us out from say , ' Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them , and because he hated them , he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness . '
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ark . "
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yahweh gave them to me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
he is your praise , and he is your God , who has done for you these great and awesome things , which your eyes have seen .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day ;
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
for the land , where you go in to possess it , isn 't as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you sowed your seed , and watered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
but the land , where you go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your grain , and your new wine , and your oil .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and you turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you .
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul ; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on , as he has spoken to you .
the blessing , if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day ;
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
it shall happen , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it , that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim , and the curse on Mount Ebal .
Aren 't they beyond the Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun , in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah , over against Gilgal , beside the oaks of Moreh ?
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and you shall possess it , and dwell therein .
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Asherim with fire ; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but when you go over the Jordan , and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you , so that you dwell in safety ;
then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh .
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
you may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vow , nor your freewill offerings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
take heed to yourself that you don 't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land .
when Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
if the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock , which Yahweh has given you , as I have commanded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your soul .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so you shall eat of it : the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only be sure that you don 't eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
you shall not eat it ; that it may go well with you , and with your children after you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
only your holy things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose :
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dispossess them , and you dispossess them , and dwell in their land ;
take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them , after that they are destroyed from before you ; and that you not inquire after their gods , saying , " How do these nations serve their gods ? I will do likewise . "
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other gods " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye pity him , neither shall you spare , neither shall you conceal him :
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the ibex , and the antelope , and the chamois .
every animal that parts the hoof , and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pig , because it has a split hoof but doesn 't chew the cud , is unclean to you : of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
and the red kite , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
for Yahweh your God will bless you , as he promised you : and you shall lend to many nations , but you shall not borrow ; and you shall rule over many nations , but they shall not rule over you .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall surely open your hand to him , and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
you shall surely give him , and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
it shall be , if he tells you , " I will not go out from you " ; because he loves you and your house , because he is well with you ;
all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God : you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd , nor shear the firstborn of your flock .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God ; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
no yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days ; neither shall any of the flesh , which you sacrifice the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
you shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your tents .
you shall count for yourselves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Levite , and the foreigner , and the fatherless , and the widow , who are within your gates .
you shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh shall choose ; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase , and in all the work of your hands , and you shall be altogether joyful .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
you shall not wrest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
you shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox , or a sheep , in which is a blemish , or anything evil ; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and has gone and served other gods , and worshiped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire diligently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in Israel ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this evil thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose ;
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
when you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and shall possess it , and shall dwell therein , and shall say , " I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are around me " ;
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Yahweh has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
it shall be , when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book , out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he and his children , in the midst of Israel .
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
the first fruits of your grain , of your new wine , and of your oil , and the first of the Fleece of your sheep , you shall give him .
if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreigner , and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God , as all his brothers the Levites do , who stand there before Yahweh .
when you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices sorcery , or an enchanter , or a sorcerer ,
you shall be perfect with Yahweh your God .
for these nations , that you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice sorcery , and to diviners ; but as for you , Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
this is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers , like you ; and I will put my words in his mouth , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yahweh your God gives you , and you succeed them , and dwell in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
your eye shall not pity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sins : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yahweh , before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified falsely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , chariots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yahweh your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak to the people ,
and shall tell them , " Hear , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don 't let your heart faint ; don 't be afraid , nor tremble , neither be scared of them ;
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart melt as his heart . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword :
but the women , and the little ones , and the livestock , and all that is in the city , even all its spoil , you shall take for a prey to yourself ; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies , which Yahweh your God has given you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but you shall utterly destroy them : the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; as Yahweh your God has commanded you ;
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it , lying in the field , and it isn 't known who has struck him ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and it shall be , that the city which is nearest to the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd , which hasn 't been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yoke ;
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him , and to bless in the name of Yahweh ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
forgive , Yahweh , your people Israel , whom you have redeemed , and don 't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel . " the blood shall be forgiven them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands , and you carry them away captive ,
and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
it shall be , if you have no delight in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a slave , because you have humbled her .
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they chasten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
his body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall surely bury him the same day ; for he who is hanged is accursed of God ; that you don 't defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
so you shall do with his donkey ; and so you shall do with his garment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yourself .
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
you shall surely let the hen go , but the young you may take to yourself ; that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a battlement for your roof , that you don 't bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
and accuses her of shameful things , and brings up an evil name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I didn 't find in her the tokens of virginity " ;
then shall the father of the young lady , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady 's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
if there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
for he found her in the field , the pledged to be married lady cried , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a lady who is a virgin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they didn 't meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall bathe himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
and you shall have a paddle among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall dig therewith , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp , to deliver you , and to give up your enemies before you ; therefore your camp shall be holy , that he may not see an unclean thing in you , and turn away from you .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleases him best : you shall not oppress him .
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be Slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
when you come into your neighbor 's standing grain , then you may pluck the ears with your hand ; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor 's standing grain .
when a man takes a wife , and marries her , then it shall be , if she find no favor in his eyes , because he has found some unseemly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before Yahweh : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance .
when a man takes a new wife , he shall not go out in the army , neither shall he be assigned any business : he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken .
if a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a slave , or sell him ; then that thief shall die : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that you observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so you shall observe to do .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
in his day you shall give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down on it ; for he is poor , and sets his heart on it : lest he cry against you to Yahweh , and it be sin to you .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a basket , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I profess this day to Yahweh your God , that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us . "
the priest shall take the basket out of your hand , and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God .
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with wonders ;
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yahweh , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yahweh your God , and worship before Yahweh your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you swore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his commandments ;
and to make you high above all nations that he has made , in praise , and in name , and in honor ; and that you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God , as he has spoken .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
and all these blessings shall come on you , and overtake you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh ; and they shall be afraid of you .
Yahweh will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock shall be Cursed .
Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with blight , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
your sky that is over your head shall be brass , and the earth that is under you shall be iron .
Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies ; you shall go out one way against them , and shall flee seven ways before them : and you shall be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth ; and there shall be none to frighten them away .
Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt , and with the tumors , and with the scurvy , and with the itch , of which you can not be healed .
and you shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropes in darkness , and you shall not prosper in your ways : and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your ox shall be slain before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your sheep shall be given to your enemies , and you shall have none to save you .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
Yahweh will bring you , and your king whom you shall set over you , to a nation that you have not known , you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods , wood and stone .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
all these curses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and overtake you , until you are destroyed ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you :
because you didn 't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
they shall besiege you in all your gates , until your high and fortified walls come down , in which you trusted , throughout all your land ; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yahweh your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , YAHWEH your God ;
then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful , and the plagues of your seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and severe sicknesses , and of long continuance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
it shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
and your life shall hang in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assurance of your life .
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
when you came to this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of the Manassites .
that you may enter into the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and into his oath , which Yahweh your God makes with you this day ;
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that is written in this book of the law .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick ;
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart , and the heart of your seed , to love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , that you may live .
if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul .
it is not in heaven , that you should say , " Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
neither is it beyond the sea , that you should say , " Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce to you this day , that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
Yahweh will deliver them up before you , and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you .
be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Yahweh your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor forsake you . "
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
Moses commanded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of tents ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yahweh your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers , flowing with milk and honey , and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and grown fat ; then will they turn to other gods , and serve them , and despise me , and break my Covenant .
it happened , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
" take this book of the law , and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh your God , that it may be there for a witness against you .
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yahweh 's portion is his people . Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to suck honey out of the rock , oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
they sacrificed to demons , not God , to gods that they didn 't know , to new gods that came up recently , which your fathers didn 't dread .
of the Rock who became your father , you are unmindful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God . they have provoked me to anger with their vanities . I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people . I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the teeth of animals on them , With the poison of crawling things of the dust .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
vengeance is mine , and recompense , at the time when their foot slides ; for the day of their calamity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make haste . "
for Yahweh will judge his people , and have compassion on his servants , when he sees that their power is gone , There is none remaining , shut up or left at large .
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood . my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he and Joshua the son of nun .
for it is no vain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
" go up into this mountain of Abarim , to Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and see the land of Canaan , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor , and was gathered to his people :
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
this is the blessing , with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
who said of his father , and of his mother , ' I have not seen him ; ' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers , Nor did he know his own children : for they have observed your word , and keep your Covenant .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness , for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the sand . "
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
Yahweh said to him , " This is the land which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands on him : and the children of Israel listened to him , and did as Yahweh commanded Moses .
in all the signs and the wonders , which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' servant , saying ,
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth , but you shall meditate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
whoever rebels against your commandment , and doesn 't listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof .
the men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords : and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said to the men , " I know that Yahweh has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
behold , when we come into the land , you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yourself into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but didn 't find them .
then the two men returned , descended from the mountain , passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
Joshua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Shittim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lodged there before they passed over .
and they commanded the people , saying , " When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then you shall move from your place , and follow it .
Joshua spoke to the priests , saying , " Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . " they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
you shall command the priests who bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying , ' When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan , you shall stand still in the Jordan . ' "
Joshua said , " Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Hivite , and the Perizzite , and the Girgashite , and the Amorite , and the Jebusite out from before you .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant being before the people ,
and when those who bore the Ark had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the Ark had dipped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest ) ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ark of Yahweh passed over , with the priests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke to them .
it happened , when the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up to the dry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
for Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
the manna ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel didn 't have manna any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh followed them .
so he caused the Ark of Yahweh to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the dawning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yahweh . only Rahab the prostitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
but as for you , only keep yourselves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy to Yahweh . they shall come into Yahweh 's treasury . "
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land , " Go into the prostitute 's house , and bring out from there the woman and all that she has , as you swore to her . "
the young men who were spies went in , and brought out Rahab with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
but Rahab the prostitute , her father 's household , and all that she had , Joshua saved alive . she lived in the midst of Israel to this day , because she hid the messengers , whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things ; for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yahweh 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
Joshua sent men from Jericho to AI , which is beside Beth Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spoke to them , saying , " Go up and spy out the land . " the men went up and spied out AI .
the men of AI struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Joshua said , " Alas , Lord Yahweh , why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to cause us to perish ? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan !
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he has , because he has transgressed the Covenant of Yahweh , and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel . ' "
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
so Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent . behold , it was hidden in his tent , with the silver under it .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yahweh .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to AI . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
he commanded them , saying , " behold , you shall lie in ambush against the city , behind the city . Don 't go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and encamped on the north side of AI . now there was a valley between him and AI .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursued Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in AI or Beth El who didn 't go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursued Israel .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward AI , for I will give it into your hand . " Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of AI .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness in which they pursued them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all Israel returned to AI , and struck it with the edge of the sword .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the lowland , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard of it
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a Covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be on us , because of the oath which we swore to them . "
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now , behold , we are in your hand . do to us as it seems good and right to you to do . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and encamped against Gibeon , and made war against it .
so Joshua went up from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
Yahweh confused them before Israel , and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon , and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah .
but don 't stay . pursue your enemies , and them from the rear . Don 't allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed , and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
Joshua took Makkedah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king . he utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with its king and all its cities , and all the souls who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but he utterly destroyed it , and all the souls who were in it .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Arabah south of Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights of Dor on the west ,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with very many horses and chariots .
Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and chased them to great Sidon , and to Misrephoth Maim , and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
the children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities , with the livestock , as spoils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them . they didn 't leave any who breathed .
for it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might utterly destroy them , that they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the hill country of Judah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon , and all the Arabah eastward :
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and ruled in Mount Hermon , and in Salecah , and in all Bashan , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .

and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . the offerings of Yahweh , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inheritance , as he spoke to him .
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;
the children of Israel alse killed Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , with the sword , among the rest of their slain .
the border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , the cities and its villages .
Moses gave an inheritance to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh . it was for the half @-@ tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families .
these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers ' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed to them ,
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
" now , behold , Yahweh has kept me alive , as he spoke , these forty @-@ five years , from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses , while Israel walked in the wilderness . now , behold , I am eighty @-@ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;

the west border was to the shore of the great sea . this is the border of the children of Judah according to their families .
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua , even Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) .
from Ekron even to the sea , all that were by the side of Ashdod , with their villages .
Ashdod , its towns and its villages ; Gaza , its towns and its villages ; to the Brook of Egypt , and the great sea with its coastline .
as for the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah couldn 't drive them out ; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho , at the waters of Jericho on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel .

together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh , for he was the firstborn of Joseph . as for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
so this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families : for the children of Abiezer , for the children of Helek , for the children of Asriel , for the children of Shechem , for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
the border went down to the Brook of Kanah , southward of the Brook . these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh . the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the Brook , and ended at the sea .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea was his border . they reached to Asher on the north , and to Issachar on the east .
Manasseh had three heights in Issachar , in Asher Beth Shean and its towns , and Ibleam and its towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh , and set up the tent of Meeting there . the land was subdued before them .
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward . it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven .
the border passed along from there to Luz , to the side of Luz ( the same is Bethel ) , southward . the border went down to Ataroth Addar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter southward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward ; and ended at Kiriath Baal ( the same is Kiriath Jearim ) , a city of the children of Judah . this was the west quarter .
the south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim . the border went out westward , and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .

the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . this was the south border .
Zelah , Eleph , the Jebusite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gibeath , and Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
the second lot came out for Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families . their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah .
out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
their border went up westward , even to Maralah , and reached to Dabbesheth . it reached to the Brook that is before Jokneam .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities with their villages .
it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon , and reached to Zebulun , and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek and Neiel . it went out to Cabul on the left hand ,

this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
so they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders . the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun in their midst .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . the children of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah , out of the tribe of the Simeonites , and out of the tribe of Benjamin .
the rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh .

they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for theirs was the first lot .
they gave them Kiriath Arba , named after the father of Anak ( the same is Hebron ) , in the hill country of Judah , with its suburbs around it .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Libnah with its suburbs ,

to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
all these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families , even the rest of the families of the Levites . their lot was twelve cities .
all the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty @-@ eight cities with their suburbs .
Yahweh gave them rest all around , according to all that he swore to their fathers . not a man of all their enemies stood before them . Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand .
now to the one half @-@ tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan ; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward . moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , a great altar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that pertains to the children of Israel . "
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , one prince of a fathers ' house for each of the tribes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
they came to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" thus says the whole Congregation of Yahweh , ' What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Yahweh , in that you have built yourselves an altar , to rebel this day against Yahweh ?
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the Congregation of Yahweh ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yahweh , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Congregation of Israel .
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh answered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh ; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering , or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings , let Yahweh himself require it .
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yahweh , the God of Israel ?
for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Reuben and children of Gad . you have no portion in Yahweh . " ' so your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh .
when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it pleased them well .
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall possess their land , as Yahweh your God spoke to you .
" therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ;
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" for Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
when they cried out to Yahweh , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea on them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt : and you lived in the wilderness many days .
" ' I brought you into the land of the Amorites , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you possessed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jericho . the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorite , the Perizzite , the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Girgashite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
Joshua said to all the people , " behold , this stone shall be a witness against us ; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us . it shall be therefore a witness against you , lest you deny your God . "
it happened after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , and had known all the work of Yahweh , that he had worked for Israel .
it happened after the death of Joshua , the children of Israel asked of Yahweh , saying , " Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? "
the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron ( now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba ) ; and they struck Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
the children of the Kenite , Moses ' brother @-@ in @-@ law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which is in the south of Arad ; and they went and lived with the people .
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns , nor Taanach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
Asher didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Acco , nor the inhabitants of Sidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob ;
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
Naphtali didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath ; but he lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor .
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley ;
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
the angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers ; and I said , ' I will never break my Covenant with you :
and you shall make no Covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
it happened , when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , who didn 't know Yahweh , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
and they forsook Yahweh , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yahweh to anger .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
wherever they went out , the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil , as Yahweh had spoken , and as Yahweh had sworn to them : and they were very distressed .
yet they didn 't listen to their judges ; for they played the prostitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obeying the commandments of Yahweh . they didn 't do so .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel ; and he said , " Because this nation have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not listened to my voice ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
the five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath .
the children of Israel lived among the Canaanites , the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a Savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
but when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised them up a Savior , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a man left @-@ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
now when he was gone out , his servants came ; and they saw , and behold , the doors of the upper room were locked ; and they said , " surely he is covering his feet in the upper room . "
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
it happened , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites , even from the children of Hobab the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim , which is by Kedesh .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
Yahweh confused Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the army , to Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; there was not a man left .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don 't be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inquires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
" hear , you kings ! give ear , you princes ! I , even I , will sing to Yahweh . I will sing praise to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
the mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh , even Sinai , at the presence of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied . the travelers walked through byways .
" speak , you who ride on white donkeys , you who sit on rich carpets , and you who walk by the way .
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water , there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh , the righteous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates .
those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Machir . those who handle the marshal 's staff came out of Zebulun .
the princes of Issachar were with Deborah . as was Issachar , so was Barak . they rushed into the valley at his feet . by the watercourses of Reuben , there were great resolves of heart .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
she put her hand to the tent peg , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer . with the hammer she struck Sisera . she struck through his head . yes , she pierced and struck through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cried : Sisera 's mother looked through the lattice . ' why is his chariot so long in coming ? why do the wheels of his chariots wait ? '
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , until you come to Gaza , and left no sustenance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor donkey .
for they came up with their livestock and their tents ; they came in as locusts for multitude ; both they and their camels were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel : and he said to them , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said to you , " I am Yahweh your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
Gideon went in , and prepared a young goat , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal . he put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out to him under the oak , and presented it .
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as Yahweh had spoken to him : and it happened , because he feared his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah was cut down that was by it , and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built .
then the men of the city said to Joash , " Bring out your son , that he may die , because he has broken down the altar of Baal , and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it . "
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool on the threshing floor ; if there is dew on the Fleece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the Fleece together , and wrung the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and encamped beside the spring of Harod : and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
the number of those who lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , was three hundred men ; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water .
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and its interpretation , that he worshiped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand ! "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
when I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and shout , ' For Yahweh and for Gideon ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after Midian .
the men of Ephraim said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you didn 't call us , when you went to fight with Midian ? " they rebuked him sharply .
God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
Gideon came to the Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men who were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
it happened , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the prostitute after the Baals , and made Baal Berith their god .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
he went to his father 's house at Ophrah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ) ;
if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech . "
Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and lived there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
they went out into the field , and harvested their vineyards , and trod the grapes , and held festival , and went into the house of their god , and ate and drank , and Cursed Abimelech .
he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , " behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
all the people likewise each cut down his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them at the base of the stronghold , and set the stronghold on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the roof of the tower .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man to his place .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and served the Baals , and the Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Sidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; and they forsook Yahweh , and didn 't serve him .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
Yahweh said to the children of Israel , " Didn 't I save you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
the people , the princes of Gilead , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a prostitute : and Gilead became the father of Jephthah .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob ;
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Therefore we have turned again to you now , that you may go with us , and fight with the children of Ammon ; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kadesh ;
Yahweh , the God of Israel , delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they struck them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
while Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns , and in Aroer and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon , three hundred years ; why didn 't you recover them within that time ?
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , it shall be Yahweh 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering . "
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
the men of Ephraim were gathered together , and passed northward ; and they said to Jephthah , " Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didn 't call us to go with you ? we will burn your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you didn 't save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Yahweh delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman , and said to her , " See now , you are barren , and don 't bear ; but you shall conceive , and bear a son .
for , behold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines . "
then Manoah entreated Yahweh , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah , her husband , wasn 't with her .
the woman made haste , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " behold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " Please , let us detain you , that we may make a young goat ready for you . "
the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah , " Though you detain me , I won 't eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Yahweh . " for Manoah didn 't know that he was the angel of Yahweh .
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
for it happened , when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar , that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar : and Manoah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
but his father and his mother didn 't know that it was of Yahweh ; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines . now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel .
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and behold , a young lion roared against him .
the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him , and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he didn 't tell his father or his mother what he had done .
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion : and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain , and also the olive groves .
he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam .
they said to him , " We have come down to bind you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines . " Samson said to them , " swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves . "
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ramath Lehi .
he was very thirsty , and called on Yahweh , and said , " You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? "
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was troubled to death .
she said , " The Philistines are upon you , Samson ! " he awoke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he didn 't know that Yahweh had departed from him .
the Philistines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hearts were merry , that they said , " Call for Samson , that he may entertain us . " they called for Samson out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests , that I may lean on them . "
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Samson performed .
Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested , and leaned on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engraved image and a molten image : and it was in the house of Micah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
Micah consecrated the Levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in ; for to that day , their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel .
they said , " arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good . do you stand still ? Don 't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land .
there set forth from there of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , even to the house of Micah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the engraved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image , the priest said to them , " What are you doing ? "
the priest 's heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the engraved image , and went in the midst of the people .
when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men who were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan said to him , " Don 't let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they took that which Micah had made , and the priest whom he had , and came to Laish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the sword ; and they burnt the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
it happened in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah .
his father @-@ in @-@ law , the young lady 's father , retained him ; and he stayed with him three days : so they ate and drink , and lodged there .
it happened on the fourth day , that they arose early in the morning , and he rose up to depart : and the young lady 's father said to his son @-@ in @-@ law , " Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
but the man wouldn 't stay that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus ( the same is Jerusalem ) : and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled ; his concubine also was with him .
when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , " Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it . "
his master said to him , " We won 't turn aside into the city of a foreigner , that is not of the children of Israel ; but we will pass over to Gibeah . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " Where are you going ? where did you come from ? "
yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your handmaid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the donkey ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
when he had come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered , " I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
the men of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have slain me , and they forced my concubine , and she is dead .
I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fellows , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
the children of Israel arose , and went up to Bethel , and asked counsel of God ; and they said , " Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? " Yahweh said , " Judah first . "
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty @-@ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came to Bethel , and wept , and sat there before Yahweh , and fasted that day until evening ; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they didn 't know that evil was close on them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
the ambushers hurried , and rushed on Gibeah ; and the ambushers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the whole Congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they said , " behold , there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah . "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
then she arose with her daughters @-@ in @-@ law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
Naomi said to her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Yahweh deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
go back , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband tonight , and should also bear sons ;
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
May Yahweh repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yahweh , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
Naomi said to Ruth her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , " It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his maidens , and that they not meet you in any other field . "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she went down to the threshing floor , and did according to all that her mother @-@ in @-@ law told her .
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
he said to the near kinsman , " Naomi , who has come back out of the country of Moab , is selling the parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's .
Boaz said to the elders , and to all the people , " You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , from the hand of Naomi .
he shall be to you a restorer of life , and sustain you in your old age , for your daughter @-@ in @-@ law , who loves you , who is better to you than seven sons , has borne him . "
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim , of the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
she said , " Let your handmaid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression wasn 't sad any more .
they rose up in the morning early , and worshiped before Yahweh , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and Yahweh remembered her .
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hungry are satisfied . yes , the barren has borne seven . she who has many children languishes .
he will keep the feet of his holy ones , but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness ; for no man shall prevail by strength .
those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces . he will Thunder against them in the sky . " Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth . he will give strength to his king , and exalt the Horn of his anointed . "
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith . so they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meeting .
a man of God came to Eli , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the affliction of my habitation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
it happened at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
and the lamp of God hadn 't yet gone out , and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh 's temple , where the Ark of God was ;
therefore Eli said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Speak , Yahweh ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house , from the beginning even to the end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
so the people sent to Shiloh ; and they brought from there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh of Armies , who sits above the cherubim : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , " What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? " they understood that the Ark of Yahweh had come into the camp .
the Philistines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Woe to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
the Philistines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day , with his clothes torn , and with earth on his head .
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the Ark of God has been captured . "
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " Don 't be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she didn 't answer , neither did she regard it .
the Philistines took the Ark of God , and brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , " The Ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us ; for his hand is severe on us , and on Dagon our god . "
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
the men who didn 't die were struck with the tumors ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the Ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
why then do you harden your hearts , as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts ? when he had worked wonderfully among them , didn 't they let the people go , and they departed ?
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
and they put the Ark of Yahweh on the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors .
the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh ; they went along the highway , lowing as they went , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh .
they of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the cart , and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
the Levites took down the Ark of Yahweh , and the coffer that was with it , in which the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh .
these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh : for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
the men of Kiriath Jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of Yahweh , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of Yahweh .
it happened , from the day that the Ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh .
they gathered together to Mizpah , and drew water , and poured it out before Yahweh , and fasted on that day , and said there , " We have sinned against Yahweh . " Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah .
when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great Thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even to Gath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines . there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and they shall run before his chariots ;
he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive groves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Becorath , the son of Aphiah , the son of a Benjamite , a mighty man of valor .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
the servant answered Saul again , and said , " behold , I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver . I will give that to the man of God , to tell us our way . "
( in earlier times in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he said , " Come , and let us go to the seer " ; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer . )
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , behold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
as for your donkeys who were lost three days ago , don 't set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the guest room , and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited , who were about thirty persons .
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took the vial of oil , and poured it on his head , and kissed him , and said , " Isn 't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance ?
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the donkeys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he didn 't tell him .
he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families ; and the family of the Matrites was taken ; and Saul the son of Kish was taken : but when they sought him , he could not be found .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul , and spoke these words in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
they said to the messengers who came , " Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead , ' Tomorrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have deliverance . ' " the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh ; and they were glad .
now , behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and gray @-@ headed ; and behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
Samuel said to the people , " It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
" when Jacob had come into Egypt , and your fathers cried to Yahweh , then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron , who brought your fathers out of Egypt , and made them to dwell in this place .
" but they forgot Yahweh their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab ; and they fought against them .
they cried to Yahweh , and said , ' We have sinned , because we have forsaken Yahweh , and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve you . '
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yahweh , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude : and they came up , and encamped in Michmash , eastward of Beth Aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
but now your kingdom shall not continue . Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you . "
Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people who were present with them , stayed in Geba of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor , " Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . " but he didn 't tell his father .
and Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , Ichabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . the people didn 't know that Jonathan was gone .
between the passes , by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines ' garrison , there was a rocky crag on the one side , and a rocky crag on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
the one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash , and the other on the south in front of Geba .
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armor bearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a furrow 's length in an acre of land .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " Withdraw your hand ! "
Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jonathan didn 't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and wherever he turned himself , he defeated them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
there was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to him .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
" it grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king ; for he is turned back from following me , and has not performed my commandments . " Samuel was angry ; and he cried to Yahweh all night .
Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to Gilgal . "
Samuel said to him , " Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you .
Samuel said , " As your sword has made women childless , so your mother will be childless among women ! " Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal .
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and encamped in the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said , " Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Yahweh shall be with you . "
Saul dressed David with his clothing . he put a helmet of brass on his head , and he clad him with a coat of mail .
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in the shepherd 's bag which he had , even in his wallet . his sling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Philistine .
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
the Philistine said to David , " Come to me , and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the field . "
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn 't save with sword and spear : for the battle is Yahweh 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hurried , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him , and cut off his head therewith . when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until you come to Gai , and to the gates of Ekron . the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even to Gath , and to Ekron .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
it happened on the next day , that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house . David played with his hand , as he did day by day . Saul had his spear in his hand ;
David said to Saul , " Who am I , and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son @-@ in @-@ law to the king ? "
Saul commanded his servants , " talk with David secretly , and say , ' behold , the king has delight in you , and all his servants love you : now therefore be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
Saul 's servants spoke those words in the ears of David . David said , " Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law , since I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ? "
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . the days were not expired ;
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it happened , as often as they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was highly esteemed .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Michal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don 't save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
Michal took the teraphim , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair at its head , and covered it with the clothes .
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
he went there to Naioth in Ramah . then the Spirit of God came on him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
David said to Jonathan , " behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
therefore deal kindly with your servant ; for you have brought your servant into a Covenant of Yahweh with you : but if there is iniquity in me , kill me yourself ; for why should you bring me to your father ? "
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone Ezel .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , you shall not be established , nor your kingdom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall surely die ! "
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
it happened in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " Isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kissed one another , and wept one with another , and David wept the most .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Yahweh ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
David arose , and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
the servants of Achish said to him , " Isn 't this David the king of the land ? Didn 't they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was discontented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Saul was sitting in Gibeah , under the tamarisk tree in Ramah , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
he struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and donkeys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their livestock , and killed them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went wherever they could go . it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he gave up going there .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
he said to him , " Don 't be afraid ; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you ; and you shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you ; and that also Saul my father knows . "
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
now therefore , O king , come down , according to all the desire of your soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king 's hand . "
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
Saul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them .
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
he came to the sheep pens by the way , where there was a cave ; and Saul went in to relieve himself . now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave .
so David checked his men with these words , and didn 't allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , " My lord the king ! " when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the earth , and showed respect .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand , you didn 't kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away unharmed ? therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' Long life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
now I have heard that you have shearers . your shepherds have now been with us , and we didn 't hurt them , neither was there anything missing from them , all the while they were in Carmel .
ask your young men , and they will tell you . therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes ; for we come in a good day . please give whatever comes to your hand , to your servants , and to your son David . ' "
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my shearers , and give it to men who I don 't know where they come from ? "
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
but the men were very good to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we anything , as long as we went with them , when we were in the fields .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
it was so , as she rode on her donkey , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
God do so to the enemies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall . "
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
now this present which your servant has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men who follow my lord .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your soul , yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God . he will sling out the souls of your enemies , as from the hollow of a sling .
it shall come to pass , when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you prince over Israel ,
that this shall be no grief to you , nor offense of heart to my lord , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . when Yahweh has dealt well with my lord , then remember your handmaid . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the wagons , and the people were encamped around him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons , with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay around him .
Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh 's anointed ; but now please take the spear that is at his head , and the jar of water , and let us go . "
he said , " Why does my lord pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in my hand ?
now therefore , don 't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains . "
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
the woman said to him , " behold , you know what Saul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land . why then do you lay a snare for my life , to cause me to die ? "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines . "
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman came to Saul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " behold , your handmaid has listened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have listened to your words which you spoke to me .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , constrained him ; and he listened to their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat on the bed .
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands ; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
we made a raid on the South of the Cherethites , and on that which belongs to Judah , and on the South of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire . "
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
and to those who were in Racal , and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites ,
and to those who were in Hormah , and to those who were in Borashan , and to those who were in Athach ,
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth ; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan .
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan ; and they came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
it happened after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag ;
it happened on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul , with his clothes torn , and earth on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and showed respect .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
( and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jashar ) :
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , Jonathan 's bow didn 't turn back . Saul 's sword didn 't return empty .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of Hebron .
the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he didn 't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
Abner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
it happened , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul .
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
now then do it ; for Yahweh has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my servant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies . ' "
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
behold , the servants of David and Joab came from a foray , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Abner was not with David in Hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Joab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Abner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into fetters . as a man falls before the children of iniquity , so you fell . " all the people wept again over him .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner .
the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
in times past , when Saul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over Israel . ' "
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
they set the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah ; and God struck him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
so David would not move the Ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
it was so , that , when those who bore the Ark of Yahweh had gone six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf .
it was so , as the Ark of Yahweh came into the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies .
he gave to all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , both to men and women , to everyone a portion of bread , dates , and raisins . so all the people departed everyone to his house .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore you shall tell my servant David this , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people , over Israel .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men ;
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before you .
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
therefore you are great , Yahweh God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Lord Yahweh , have spoken it . let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing . "
after this it happened that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines .
he struck Moab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
then Ziba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so Mephibosheth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
it happened after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his place .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David , the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob , and the Syrians of Zobah , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah with one thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob , and the men of Tob and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
it happened at evening , that David arose from off his bed , and walked on the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her uncleanness ) ; and she returned to her house .
when Uriah had come to him , David asked of him how Joab did , and how the people fared , and how the war prospered .
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
when they had told David , saying , " Uriah didn 't go down to his house , " David said to Uriah , " haven 't you come from a journey ? why didn 't you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but didn 't go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
it happened , when Joab kept watch on the city , that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bosom , and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
why have you despised the word of Yahweh , to do that which is evil in his sight ? you have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
" this is what Yahweh says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
the elders of his house arose beside him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
but when David saw that his servants were whispering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David 's brother ; and Jonadab was a very subtle man .
so Amnon lay down and faked being sick . when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , " Please let my sister Tamar come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . "
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . she took dough , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Amnon said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Amnon said to Tamar , " Bring the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother .
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
Tamar put ashes on her head , and tore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
but Absalom fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
your handmaid had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your handmaid said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant . '
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then your handmaid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . May Yahweh , your God , be with you . ' "
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
Joab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Joab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
when he cut the hair of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels , after the king 's weight .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and kissed him .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem , who were invited , and went in their simplicity ; and they didn 't know anything .
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
the king went forth , and all the people after him ; and they stayed in Beth Merhak .
all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men who came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God ; and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
but if he say thus , ' I have no delight in you ; ' behold , here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
David went up by the ascent of the Mount of olives , and wept as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went barefoot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn , and earth on his head .
Don 't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when king David came to Bahurim , behold , a man of the family of the house of Saul came out , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera . he came out , and Cursed still as he came .
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him , and Cursed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw dust .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
again , whom should I serve ? Shouldn 't I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
so they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house ; and Absalom went in to his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
the counsel of Ahithophel , which he gave in those days , was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
but I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
Absalom and all the men of Israel said , " The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . " for Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom .
then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his donkey , and arose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and hanged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
Joab said to the man who told him , " behold , you saw it , and why didn 't you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a sash . "
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
then Joab said , " I 'm not going to wait like this with you . " he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
they took Absalom , and cast him into the great pit in the forest , and raised over him a very great heap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king grieves for his son . "
Joab came into the house to the king , and said , " You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have saved your life , and the lives of your sons and of your daughters , and the lives of your wives , and the lives of your concubines ;
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king ; and he had neither groomed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace .
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
the king answered , " Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you . whatever you require of me , that I will do for you . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
so Amasa went to call the men of Judah together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall surely ask counsel at Abel ; ' and so they settled it .
now Joab was over all the army of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bore to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son : and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . after that God was entreated for the land .
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Philistines at Gob ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
these four were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my Savior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from my enemies .
in my distress I called on Yahweh . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry came into his ears .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh , At the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
you will save the afflicted people , But your eyes are on the haughty , that you may bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
I have consumed them , and struck them through , so that they can 't arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth . I crushed them as the mire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
now these are the last words of David . David the son of Jesse says , the man who was raised on high says , the anointed of the God of Jacob , the sweet psalmist of Israel :
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without clouds , when the tender grass springs out of the earth , through clear shining after rain . '
but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away , because they can 't be taken with the hand ,
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Wasn 't he most honorable of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spear .
the king said to Joab the captain of the army , who was with him , " Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beersheba , and number the people , that I may know the sum of the people . "
notwithstanding , the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the army . Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the stronghold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites , and of the Canaanites ; and they went out to the south of Judah , at Beersheba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he couldn 't keep warm .
therefore his servants said to him , " Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin . let her stand before the king , and cherish him ; and let her lie in your bosom , that my lord the king may keep warm . "
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' Didn 't you , my lord , king , swear to your handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does Adonijah reign ? '
behold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
he has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the army ; but he hasn 't called Solomon your servant .
you , my lord the king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
they told the king , saying , " behold , Nathan the prophet ! " when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but he hasn 't called me , even me your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon .
most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh , the God of Israel , saying , ' Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah . "
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mule .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
Adonijah feared because of Solomon ; and he arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
now therefore don 't hold him guiltless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood . "
the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
the news came to Joab ; for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he didn 't turn after Absalom . Joab fled to the tent of Yahweh , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
it was told king Solomon , " Joab has fled to the tent of Yahweh , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
so shall their blood return on the head of Joab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Yahweh . "
then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath . they told Shimei , saying , " behold , your servants are in Gath . "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place . Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
now , Yahweh my God , you have made your servant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don 't know how to go out or come in .
your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can 't be numbered nor counted for multitude .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
Solomon awoke ; and behold , it was a dream . then he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and offered up burnt offerings , offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no stranger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while your handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
Baana the son of Ahilud , in Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan , beneath Jezreel , from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah , as far as beyond Jokmeam ;
Ben Geber , in Ramoth Gilead ( to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him belonged the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tribute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
for he had dominion over all on this side the River , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all the nations all around .
he spoke of trees , from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall ; he spoke also of animals , and of birds , and of creeping things , and of fish .
Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet .
Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil . Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Ziv , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yahweh .
the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was its length , according to the breadth of the house . ten cubits was its breadth before the house .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the nethermost story was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad ; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around , that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my statutes , and execute my ordinances , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
he set the cherubim within the inner house ; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
so he made two doors of olive wood ; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold ; and he spread the gold on the cherubim , and on the palm trees .
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
he made the porch of pillars ; its length was fifty cubits , and its breadth thirty cubits ; and a porch before them ; and pillars and a threshold before them .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
he made two capitals of molten brass , to set on the tops of the pillars : the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
there were nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
it was a handbreadth thick : and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it held two thousand baths .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
every base had four bronze wheels , and axles of brass ; and the four feet of it had supports : beneath the basin were the supports molten , with wreaths at the side of each .
the four wheels were underneath the panels ; and the axles of the wheels were in the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axles , and their rims , and their spokes , and their naves , were all molten .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
and the lampstands , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , of pure gold ; and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold ;
and the cups , and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , of the temple , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
they brought up the Ark of Yahweh , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; even these the priests and the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
it came to pass , when the priests had come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh ,
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
he said , " blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
Yahweh has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
there I have set a place for the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" now therefore , God of Israel , please let your word be verified , which you spoke to your servant David my father .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when your people Israel are struck down before the enemy , because they have sinned against you ; if they turn again to you , and confess your name , and pray and make supplication to you in this house :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
" if there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence , if there is blight , mildew , locust or caterpillar ; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities ; whatever plague , whatever sickness there is ;
whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sinned , and have done perversely ; we have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies , who carried them captive , and pray to you toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and forgive your people who have sinned against you , and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you ; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
( for they are your people , and your inheritance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
" blessed be Yahweh , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Moses his servant .
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
let these my words , with which I have made supplication before Yahweh , be near to Yahweh our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Yahweh , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh .
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they didn 't please him .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fifty , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bore spices , and very much gold , and precious stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she talked with him of all that was in her heart .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . behold , the half was not told me ! your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , and armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty ; and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
for it happened , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
therefore Yahweh said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
however I will not tear away all the kingdom ; but I will give one tribe to your son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran ; and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's house among the sons of Pharaoh .
when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the army was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and lived therein , and reigned in Damascus .
Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breach of the city of David his father .
the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him , and tore it in twelve pieces .
( but he shall have one tribe , for my servant David 's sake and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tribes .
to his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , aren 't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
" your father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make you the grievous service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a servant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh , that he might establish his word , which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned , that they sent and called him to the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . "
behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El : and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense .
the altar also was split apart , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh .
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
now there lived an old prophet in Bethel ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh , and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you ,
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
behold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
it happened , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , " When I am dead , then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried . lay my bones beside his bones .
for the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , will surely happen . "
this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth .
take with you ten loaves , and cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . now Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he has sinned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh , the guard bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and lived in Tirzah .
then king ASA made a proclamation to all Judah ; none was exempted : and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and king ASA built therewith Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
" because I exalted you out of the dust , and made you prince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam , and have made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
behold , I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he struck all the house of Baasha : he didn 't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
the people who were encamped heard say , Zimri has conspired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
it happened , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he committed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the thirty @-@ eighth year of ASA king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty @-@ two years .
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshiped him .
Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
it shall be , that you shall drink of the Brook . I have commanded the ravens to feed you there . "
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
Elijah said to her , " Don 't be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little cake first , and bring it out to me , and afterward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
it happened after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so severe , that there was no breath left in him .
he said to her , " Give me your son . " he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into the room where he stayed , and laid him on his own bed .
Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " behold , your son lives . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah , in the third year , saying , " Go , show yourself to Ahab ; and I will send rain on the earth . "
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lord Elijah ? "
Wasn 't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh , how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh 's prophets with fifty to a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of Yahweh came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
he put the wood in order , and cut the bull in pieces , and laid it on the wood . he said , " fill four jars with water , and pour it on the burnt offering , and on the wood . "
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
Elijah said to them , " seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and killed them there .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
he came there to a cave , and lodged there ; and behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill ; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed to Baal , and every mouth which has not kissed him . "
Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @-@ two kings with him , and horses and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and fought against it .
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben Hadad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleasant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @-@ two . after them , he mustered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty @-@ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samaria . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the princes of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
the servants of the king of Syria said to him , " Their god is a god of the hills ; therefore they were stronger than we . but let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
they encamped one over against the other seven days . so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined ; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day .
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @-@ seven thousand men who were left . Ben Hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city , who lived with Naboth .
set two men , base fellows , before him , and let them testify against him , saying , ' You Cursed God and the king ! ' then carry him out , and stone him to death . "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
behold , I will bring evil on you , and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " surely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Jehoshaphat cried out .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of his chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the battle ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
he walked in all the way of ASA his father ; He didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , in which he made Israel to sin .
but the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite , " arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and tell them , ' Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub , the god of Ekron ?
then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him . he went up to him ; and behold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down ! ' "
behold , fire came down from the sky , and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties . but now let my life be precious in your sight . "
so he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken . Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
he said , " You have asked a hard thing . if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
Elisha saw it , and he cried , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and tore them in two pieces .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and struck the waters , and said , " Where is Yahweh , the God of Elijah ? " when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and Elisha went over .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
the men of the city said to Elisha , " behold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land miscarries . "
he went out to the spring of the waters , and threw salt into it , and said , " Thus says Yahweh , ' I have healed these waters . there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying . ' "
he went up from there to Bethel . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mocked him , and said to him , " Go up , you baldy ! go up , you baldhead ! "
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cursed them in the name of Yahweh . two female bears came out of the woods , and mauled forty @-@ two of those youths .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
you shall strike every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
it happened in the morning , about the time of offering the offering , that behold , water came by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on armor , and upward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place , and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . there was great wrath against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and pour out into all those containers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
it fell on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where there was a prominent woman ; and she persuaded him to eat bread . so it was , that as often as he passed by , he turned in there to eat bread .
please let us make a little room on the wall . let us set for him there a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp stand . it shall be , when he comes to us , that he shall turn in there . "
she called to her husband , and said , " Please send me one of the servants , and one of the donkeys , that I may run to the man of God , and come again . "
then she saddled a donkey , and said to her servant , " Drive , and go forward ! Don 't slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
so she went , and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel . it happened , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , " behold , there is the Shunammite .
when Elisha had come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
Elisha came again to Gilgal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . "
one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of stew ; for they didn 't recognize them .
so they poured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were eating of the stew , that they cried out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the pot ! " they could not eat of it .
now Naaman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of valor , but he was a leper .
the Syrians had gone out in bands , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
Aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water . then he cried , and said , " Alas , my master ! for it was borrowed . "
now the king of Syria was warring against Israel ; and he took counsel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " won 't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
he said , " Go and see where he is , that I may send and get him . " it was told him , saying , " behold , he is in Dothan . "
it happened , when they had come into Samaria , that Elisha said , " Yahweh , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yahweh opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
so we boiled my son , and ate him : and I said to her on the next day , ' Give your son , that we may eat him ; ' and she has hidden her son . "
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he tore his clothes ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh .
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and plundered the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of Yahweh .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
it happened at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines . then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Hazael reigned in his place .
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife . he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of the house of Ahab .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
then take the vial of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I have anointed you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don 't wait . "
he arose , and went into the house . then he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish . I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses . then he trampled her under foot .
they went to bury her ; but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the body of Jezebel shall be as Dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel , so that they shall not say , " This is Jezebel . " ' "
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fortified city also , and armor .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
so Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that didn 't come . they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
you shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be slain . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath , with those who were to go out on the Sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yahweh .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the house of Yahweh :
Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Bring her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don 't let her be slain in the house of Yahweh . "
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the horses ' entry to the king 's house . she was slain there .
all the people of the land went to the house of Baal , and broke it down ; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . the priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh .
he took the captains over hundreds , and the Carites , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Yahweh , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . he sat on the throne of the kings .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king 's house .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
but Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and bored a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh : and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh : and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders , who worked on the house of Yahweh ,
and to the masons and the stone cutters , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and struck Joash at the house of Millo , on the way that goes down to Silla .
for Jozacar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , struck him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael , continually .
( Yahweh gave Israel a Savior , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh ; he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over him , and said , " My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! "
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
Elisha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
it happened , as they were burying a man , that behold , they spied a band ; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha : and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth Shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
Yahweh didn 't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus , and Hamath , which had belonged to Judah , for Israel , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
Yahweh struck the king , so that he was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house . Jotham the king 's son was over the household , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Jotham his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as his fathers had done : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zechariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and killed him , and reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
there came against the land Pul the king of Assyria ; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
now the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
now the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh ; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath , and lived there , to this day .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria , saying , " I am your servant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria listened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried its people captive to Kir , and killed Rezin .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
when the king had come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king drew near to the altar , and offered on it .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
the bronze altar , which was before Yahweh , he brought from the forefront of the house , from between his altar and the house of Yahweh , and put it on the north side of his altar .
King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases , and removed the basin from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it , and put it on a pavement of stone .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they didn 't depart from them ;
until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day .
the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Avva , and from Hamath and Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria , and lived in the cities of it .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they didn 't fear Yahweh : therefore Yahweh sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , " Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
so one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear Yahweh .
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom Yahweh had made a Covenant , and commanded them , saying , " You shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
but you shall fear Yahweh , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm , and you shall bow yourselves to him , and you shall sacrifice to him .
the statutes and the ordinances , and the law and the commandment , which he wrote for you , you shall observe to do forevermore . you shall not fear other gods .
you shall not forget the Covenant that I have made with you ; neither shall you fear other gods .
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Asherah : and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it ; and he called it Nehushtan .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
because they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh their God , but transgressed his Covenant , even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem . they went up and came to Jerusalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now , behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised Reed , even in Egypt . if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , came with Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
they said to him , " Thus says Hezekiah , ' This day is a day of trouble , of rebuke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the point of birth , and there is no strength to deliver them .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " behold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent messengers again to Hezekiah , saying ,
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Telassar ?
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it . then Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh , and spread it before Yahweh .
Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh , and said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , who sit above the cherubim , you are the God , even you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . you have made heaven and earth .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yahweh our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you , Yahweh , are God alone . "
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like grain blasted before it has grown up .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose , and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
" ' this shall be the sign to you : you shall eat this year that which grows of itself , and in the second year that which springs of the same ; and in the third year sow , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat its fruit .
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place .
in those days was Hezekiah sick to death . Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order ; for you shall die , and not live . ' "
" remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
Hezekiah answered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . Nay , but let the shadow return backward ten steps . "
at that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
'Behold , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Babylon . nothing shall be left , ' says Yahweh .
'Of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the conduit , and brought water into the city , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made an Asherah , as did Ahab king of Israel , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he made his son to pass through the fire , and practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his place .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshiped them :
and he forsook Yahweh , the God of his fathers , and didn 't walk in the way of Yahweh .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt faithfully . "
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh . "
Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , " Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me . " Shaphan read it before the king .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' "
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : ' concerning the words which you have heard ,
'Therefore behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh , outside of Jerusalem , to the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the priests of the high places didn 't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem , but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers .
he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
he broke in pieces the pillars , and cut down the Asherim , and filled their places with the bones of men .
moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that altar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust , and burned the Asherah .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
he killed all the priests of the high places that were there , on the altars , and burned men 's bones on them ; and he returned to Jerusalem .
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yahweh with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father , and changed his name to Jehoiakim : but he took Jehoahaz away ; and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
the king of Egypt didn 't come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Babylon had taken , from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates , all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh 's temple , as Yahweh had said .
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it around it .
on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans , the basins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pillars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh , the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
as for the people who were left in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , governor .
now when all the captains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
Gedaliah swore to them and to their men , and said to them , " Don 't be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans . dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you . "
but it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck Gedaliah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .
it happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison ;
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .
Canaan became the father of Sidon his firstborn , and Heth ,
Joktan became the father of Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
the sons of Keturah , Abraham 's concubine : she bore Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah . the sons of Jokshan : Sheba , and Dedan .
now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel : Bela the son of Beor ; and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place ; and the name of his city was Avith .

ram became the father of Amminadab , and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon , prince of the children of Judah ;
afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead , whom he took as wife when he was sixty years old ; and she bore him Segub .
the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were Mesha his firstborn , who was the father of Ziph ; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron .
now these were the sons of David , who were born to him in Hebron : the firstborn , Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; the second , Daniel , of Abigail the Carmelitess ;
Reaiah the son of Shobal became the father of Jahath ; and Jahath became the father of Ahumai and Lahad . these are the families of the Zorathites .

and Jokim , and the men of Cozeba , and Joash , and Saraph , who had dominion in Moab , and Jashubilehem . the records are ancient .
these were the potters , and the inhabitants of Netaim and Gederah : there they lived with the king for his work .

and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of ASA , the son of Elkanah , who lived in the villages of the Netophathites .
all these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh , even the house of the tent , by wards .
for the four chief porters , who were Levites , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God 's house .
some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanctuary , and over the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans .
some of their brothers , of the sons of the Kohathites , were over the show bread , to prepare it every Sabbath .
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .

the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
in times past , even when Saul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh your God said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over my people Israel . ' "
David and all Israel went to Jerusalem ( the same is Jebus ) ; and the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel .
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time .
he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
the three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh ,
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow : they were of Saul 's brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Jozabad the Gederathite ,
these of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zillethai , captains of thousands who were of Manasseh .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of Yahweh .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father 's house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul .
of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous men in their fathers ' houses .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
of the Danites who could set the battle in array , twenty @-@ eight thousand six hundred .
of Asher , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , forty thousand .
on the other side of the Jordan , of the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand .
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
they carried the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ark ; and there he died before God .
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of Yahweh to its place , which he had prepared for it .
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fathers ' households of the Levites . Sanctify yourselves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
for because you didn 't carry it at first , Yahweh our God made broke out against us , because we didn 't seek him according to the ordinance . "
the children of the Levites bore the Ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud ;
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed Lyre , to lead .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps .
it happened , as the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ;
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians twenty @-@ two thousand men .
King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
it happened after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his place .
then there went certain persons , and told David how the men were served . he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly ashamed . the king said , " Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . "
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the gate of the city : and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @-@ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
David said to God , " I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . "
David said to Gad , " I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
at that time , when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
but the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , ' You have shed blood abundantly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight .
May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
now , behold , in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold , one million talents of silver , and brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance . I have also prepared timber and stone ; and you may add to them .
there are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work :
the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @-@ eight thousand .
David said , " Of these , twenty @-@ four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
the sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
these were the sons of Levi after their fathers ' houses , even the heads of the fathers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh , from twenty years old and upward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the purifying of all holy things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
and that they should keep the duty of the tent of Meeting , and the duty of the holy place , and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers , for the service of the house of Yahweh .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen , heads of fathers ' houses ; and of the sons of Ithamar , according to their fathers ' houses , eight .
thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots ; for there were princes of the sanctuary , and princes of God , both of the sons of Eleazar , and of the sons of Ithamar .
this was their ordering in their service , to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yahweh , the God of Israel , had commanded him .
of the Izharites , Shelomoth ; of the sons of Shelomoth , Jahath .
the sons of Mushi : Mahli , and Eder , and Jerimoth . these were the sons of the Levites after their fathers ' houses .
moreover , David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with stringed instruments , and with cymbals : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :
of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asharelah , the sons of Asaph , under the hand of Asaph , who prophesied after the order of the king .
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yahweh , with cymbals , stringed instruments , and harps , for the service of God 's house ; Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman being under the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
for the divisions of the doorkeepers : of the Korahites , Meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of Asaph .
also to Shemaiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of valor .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fathers ' houses , for every gate .
these were the divisions of the doorkeepers ; of the sons of the Korahites , and of the sons of Merari .
of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Ladan , the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan , the heads of the fathers ' households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite : Jehieli .
this Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fathers ' households , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the army , had dedicated .
all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated , whoever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of Shelomoth , and of his brothers .
of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brothers , men of valor , one thousand seven hundred , had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward , for all the business of Yahweh , and for the service of the king .
of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief , even of the Hebronites , according to their generations by fathers ' households . in the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
this is that Benaiah , who was the mighty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Ammizabad his son .

of the children of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Azaziah : of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , Joel the son of Pedaiah :
but David didn 't take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :
over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub :
and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite : and over the cellars of oil was Joash :

also Jonathan , David 's uncle , was a counselor , a man of understanding , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
of all my sons ( for Yahweh has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh 's kingdom over Israel .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple , and of its houses , and of its treasuries , and of the upper rooms of it , and of the inner rooms of it , and of the place of the mercy seat ;
and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit , for the courts of the house of Yahweh , and for all the surrounding rooms , for the treasuries of God 's house , and for the treasuries of the dedicated things ;
also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh , and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh ;
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
by weight also for the lampstands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps ; and for the lampstands of silver , by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lampstand ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
in addition , because I have set my affection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans . who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh ? "
then the princes of the fathers ' households , and the princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers over the king 's work , offered willingly ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh , under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
for we are strangers before you , and foreigners , as all our fathers were . our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
Yahweh , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ;
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Samuel the seer , and in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the history of Gad the seer ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
but David had brought the Ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
now , Yahweh God , let your promise to David my father be established ; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a horse for one hundred fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , " As you dealt with David my father , and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell , so deal with me .
" send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon : and behold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
behold , I will give to your servants , the cutters who cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil . "
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and its breadth twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under it was the likeness of oxen , which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea . the oxen were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it stood on twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
it was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it received and held three thousand baths .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid their doors with brass .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
the two pillars , and the bowls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars , and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ,
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
and the snuffers , and the basins , and the spoons , and the fire pans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treasuries of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh to its place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubim .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
it happened , when the priests had come out of the holy place , ( for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves , and didn 't keep their divisions ;
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
" Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Yahweh promised , and have built the house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
there I have set the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with the children of Israel . "
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the petitions of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : yes , hear from your dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing retribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" if your people Israel be struck down before the enemy , because they have sinned against you , and shall turn again and confess your name , and pray and make supplication before you in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
" if there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence , if there is blight or mildew , locust or caterpillar ; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities ; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is ;
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear from heaven , your dwelling place and forgive , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of the children of men ; )
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your outstretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who doesn 't sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity , saying , ' We have sinned , we have done perversely , and have dealt wickedly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , where they have carried them captive , and pray toward their land , which you gave to their fathers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their petitions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
" now , my God , let , I beg you , your eyes be open , and let your ears be attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
" now therefore arise , Yahweh God , into your resting place , you , and the Ark of your strength : let your priests , Yahweh God , be clothed with salvation , and let your saints rejoice in Goodness .
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
the priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh , because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh 's house .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the Goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yahweh , and in his own house .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
if my people , who are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I covenanted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
but if you turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Baalath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his chariots , and the cities for his horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the set feasts , three times in the year , in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh , and until it was finished . so the house of Yahweh was completed .
Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , aren 't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
they sent and called him ; and Jeroboam and all Israel came , and they spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
" your father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make you the grievous service of your father , and his heavy yoke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Your father made our yoke heavy , but make it lighter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist .
so the king didn 't listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Yahweh might establish his word , which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
and he appointed him priests for the high places , and for the male goats , and for the calves which he had made .
after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
so they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years ; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon .
he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin , to every fortified city : and he gave them food in abundance . he sought for them many wives .
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , aren 't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer , after the way of genealogies ? there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
" now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multitude , and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods .
" but as for us , Yahweh is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and we have priests ministering to Yahweh , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites in their work :
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don 't fight against Yahweh , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with its towns , and Jeshanah with its towns , and Ephron with its towns .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
ASA and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar : and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yahweh , and before his army ; and they carried away very much booty .
but when in their distress they turned to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
they sacrificed to Yahweh in that day , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep .
they entered into the Covenant to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
and that whoever would not seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
also Maacah , the mother of ASA the king , he removed from being queen , because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah ; and ASA cut down her image , and made dust of it , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA , Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Yahweh your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
for the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein you have done foolishly ; for from henceforth you shall have wars . "
then ASA was angry with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . ASA oppressed some of the people at the same time .
behold , the acts of ASA , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
and with them the Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tobadonijah , the Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , the priests .
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead .
now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
Yahweh said , ' Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
" he said , ' I will go forth , and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . ' " he said , ' You will entice him , and will prevail also . go forth , and do so . '
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
and say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Jehoshaphat cried out , and Yahweh helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bow at random , and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor . therefore he said to the driver of the chariot , " Turn your hand , and carry me out of the army ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , " Should you help the wicked , and love those who hate Yahweh ? because of this , wrath is on you from before Yahweh .
Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem : and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim , and brought them back to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you . take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of bribes . "
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them some of the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries , when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel .
Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
he walked in the way of ASA his father , and didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani , which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day : then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , " Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , ' Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father , nor in the ways of ASA king of Judah ,
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute , like the house of Ahab did , and also have slain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
and they came up against Judah , and broke into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , except Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
thirty @-@ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
all the assembly made a Covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
this is the thing that you shall do . a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the thresholds .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sabbath ; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest didn 't dismiss the shift .
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh : and they came through the upper gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the throne of the kingdom .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals .
so the king commanded , and they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh .
all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh ; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh , and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king listened to them .
they forsook the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherim and the idols : and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syrians came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus .
Amaziah was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan , of Jerusalem .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense to them .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
you say to yourself that you have struck Edom ; and your heart lifts you up to boast . now stay at home . why should you meddle with trouble , that you should fall , even you , and Judah with you ? ' "
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth Shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in God 's house with Obed @-@ Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , aren 't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the heads of fathers ' households , even the mighty men of valor , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked on him , and behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out quickly from there ; yes , himself hurried also to go out , because Yahweh had struck him .
Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a leper . " Jotham his son reigned in his place .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the ruler of the house , and Elkanah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . Aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against those who came from the war ,
the Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland , and of the South of Judah , and had taken Beth Shemesh , and Aijalon , and Gederoth , and Soco with its towns , and Timnah with its towns , Gimzo also and its towns : and they lived there .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh ; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh 's temple into the court of the house of Yahweh . the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad to the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh ; and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days : and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
so they killed the bulls , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : and they killed the rams , and sprinkled the blood on the altar : they killed also the lambs , and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar . when the burnt offering began , the song of Yahweh began also , and the trumpets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
Don 't be like your fathers , and like your brothers , who trespassed against Yahweh , the God of their fathers , so that he gave them up to desolation , as you see .
they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day , singing with loud instruments to Yahweh .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of Yahweh .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
the children of Israel and Judah , who lived in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep , and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God , and laid them by heaps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the Brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
" be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude who is with him ; for there is a greater with us than with him .
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us , and to fight our battles . " the people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
after this , Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem , ( now he was before Lachish , and all his power with him ) , to Hezekiah king of Judah , and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem , saying ,
Doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jerusalem , as of the gods of the peoples of the earth , which are the work of men 's hands .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all kinds of goodly vessels ;
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . Manasseh his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down ; and he reared up altars for the Baals , and made Asheroth , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ; and he practiced sorcery , and used enchantments , and practiced sorcery , and dealt with those who had familiar spirits , and with wizards : he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
he prayed to him ; and he was entreated by him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God .
he took away the foreign gods , and the idol out of the house of Yahweh , and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer to his God , and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel , behold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his prayer also , and how God was entreated of him , and all his sin and his trespass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Asherim and the engraved images , before he humbled himself : behold , they are written in the history of Hozai .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he didn 't humble himself before Yahweh , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but this same Amon trespassed more and more .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and into the hand of the workmen . "
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
so Hilkiah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place , and it shall not be quenched . ' " '
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
Josiah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lambs and young goats , all of them for the Passover offerings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bulls : these were of the king 's substance .
Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethanel , his brothers , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , the chiefs of the Levites , gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock , and five hundred head of cattle .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yahweh , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
so his servants took him out of the chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had , and brought him to Jerusalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tombs of his fathers . all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds , according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh ,
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and scoffed at his prophets , until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people , until there was no remedy .
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
" thus says Cyrus king of Persia , ' Yahweh , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
whoever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of Yahweh , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jerusalem .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon , and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah , everyone to his city ;
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Hassophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty @-@ two .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of tents , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the ordinance , as the duty of every day required ;
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to have the oversight of the workmen in God 's house : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brothers the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard far away .
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh , the God of Israel ;
and hired counselors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of his companions , to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian , and set forth in the Syrian language .
then Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over , and set in the city of Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria , and in the rest of the country beyond the River : peace , and so forth .
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tribute , custom , and toll , was paid to them .
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
then we told them in this way , what the names of the men were who were making this building .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought into the temple of Babylon , those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a scroll , and therein was thus written for a record :
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
also I have made a decree , that whoever shall alter this word , let a beam be pulled out from his house , and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this :
this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
for the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh , and of his statutes to Israel :
Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls , rams , lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
to one hundred talents of silver , and to one hundred measures of wheat , and to one hundred baths of wine , and to one hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , the singers , porters , Nethinim , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , custom , or toll , on them .
whoever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all diligence , whether it be to death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be Yahweh , the God of our fathers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem ;
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom . of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel . of the sons of David , Hattush .
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah ; and with him one hundred sixty males .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava ; and there we encamped three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , who were teachers .
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his counselors , and his princes , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered Ezra , " We have trespassed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
then Ezra rose up from before God 's house , and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came there , he ate no bread , nor drank water ; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
and that whoever didn 't come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity .
now therefore make confession to Yahweh , the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
the children of the captivity did so . Ezra the priest , with certain heads of fathers ' households , after their fathers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and his brothers , Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , " I beg you , Yahweh , the God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
but if you return to me , and keep my commandments and do them , though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to dwell there . '
it happened in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
moreover I said to the king , " If it pleases the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I rode on .
I went out by night by the valley gate , even toward the Jackal 's well , and to the Dung gate , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were broken down , and its gates were consumed with fire .
then went I up in the night by the Brook , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the valley gate , and so returned .
the rulers didn 't know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they ridiculed us , and despised us , and said , " What is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? "
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it , to the tower of Hananel .
next to them , Meremoth the son of Uriah , the son of Hakkoz made repairs . next to them , Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabel made repairs . next to them , Zadok the son of Baana made repairs .
next to them , the Tekoites made repairs ; but their nobles didn 't put their necks to the work of their lord .
Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the old gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its bolts , and its bars .
next to them , Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , repaired the residence of the governor beyond the River .
next to him , Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , goldsmiths , made repairs . next to him , Hananiah one of the perfumers made repairs , and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall .
next to them , Rephaiah the son of Hur , the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem , made repairs .
next to him , Shallum the son of Hallohesh , the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem , he and his daughters , made repairs .
Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the valley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars , and one thousand cubits of the wall to the Dung gate .
Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the Dung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
after him , Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur , made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the mighty men .
next to him , Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , repaired another portion , across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another portion , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king , which is by the court of the guard . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs .
after them , Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah , the keeper of the east gate made repairs .
after him , Hananiah the son of Shelemiah , and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph , repaired another portion . after him , Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs across from his room .
after him , Malchijah one of the goldsmiths to the house of the Nethinim , and of the merchants , made repairs over against the gate of Hammiphkad , and to the ascent of the corner .
but it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
but it happened that when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabians , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the coats of mail ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trumpet was by me .
so we worked in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clothes . everyone took his weapon to the water .
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
moreover there were at my table , of the Jews and the rulers , one hundred fifty men , besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us .
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Judah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
I said , " Should such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in . "
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and Tobiah 's letters came to them .
for there were many in Judah sworn to him , because he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of Shecaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah , everyone to his city ;
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , one hundred thirty @-@ eight .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty @-@ two .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred minas of silver .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinim , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
also Jeshua , and Bani , and Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stayed in their place .
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers ' households of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , to Ezra the scribe , even to give attention to the words of the law .
they found written in the law , how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month ;
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves booths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths , and lived in the booths ; for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gladness .
also day by day , from the first day to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according to the ordinance .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they confessed , and worshiped Yahweh their God .
and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them , and made a name for yourself , as it is this day .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them .
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and didn 't withhold your manna from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" yes , forty years you sustained them in the wilderness . they lacked nothing . their clothes didn 't grow old , and their feet didn 't swell .
moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples , which you allotted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins : also they have power over our bodies , and over our livestock , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
now those who sealed were : Nehemiah the governor , the son of Hacaliah , and Zedekiah ,
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
also the firstborn of our sons , and of our livestock , as it is written in the law , and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , to the priests who minister in the house of our God ;
the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts in the other cities .
in Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Judah : Athaiah the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalalel , of the children of Perez ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
all the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty @-@ eight valiant men .
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jeshaiah .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @-@ two ; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashhur , the son of Malchijah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @-@ two ; and Amashsai the son of Azarel , the son of Ahzai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chiefs of the Levites , who had the oversight of the outward business of God 's house ;
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns , and in Dibon and its towns , and in Jekabzeel and its villages ,
Jeshua became the father of Joiakim , and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib , and Eliashib became the father of Joiada ,
as for the Levites , in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , there were recorded the heads of fathers ' households ; also the priests , in the reign of Darius the Persian .
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
the chiefs of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brothers over against them , to praise and give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , watch next to watch .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest the scribe .
then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the Dung gate ;
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
and his brothers , Shemaiah , and Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and Ezra the scribe was before them .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
and above the gate of Ephraim , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the tower of Hananel , and the tower of Hammeah , even to the sheep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the purification , and so did the singers and the porters , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don 't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observances .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they didn 't come on the Sabbath .
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
I contended with them , and Cursed them , and struck certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , " You shall not give your daughters to their sons , nor take their daughters for your sons , or for yourselves .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
thus I cleansed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites , everyone in his work ;
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment ;
Memucan answered before the king and the princes , " Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
for he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to its writing , and to every people in their language , that every man should rule his own house , speaking in the language of his own people .
after these things , when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Esther was doing , and what would become of her .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
so Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
the king loved Esther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
when this matter was investigated , and it was found to be so , they were both hanged on a tree ; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king 's presence .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bowed down , and paid Homage to Haman ; for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai didn 't bow down or pay him Homage .
but he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone , for they had made known to him Mordecai 's people . therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even Mordecai 's people .
if it pleases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treasuries . "
the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
in every province , wherever the king 's commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
Esther 's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly grieved . she sent clothing to Mordecai , to replace his sackcloth ; but he didn 't receive it .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , she obtained favor in his sight ; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand . so Esther came near , and touched the top of the scepter .
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Haman had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition , queen Esther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
on that day , King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman , the Jews ' enemy , to Esther the queen . Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was to her .
Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , " See , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged on the gallows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out , hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa .
all the princes of the provinces , the satraps , the governors , and those who did the king 's business helped the Jews , because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
then Esther said , " If it pleases the king , let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged on the gallows . "
the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and killed three hundred men in Shushan ; but they didn 't lay their hand on the spoil .
but the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month ; and on the fifteenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the unwalled towns , make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plotted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he had devised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews , nor their memory perish from their seed .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . that man was blameless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
and the Sabeans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
he said , " naked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . blessed be the name of Yahweh . "
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn 't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his grief was very great .
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
because it didn 't shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why didn 't I die from the womb ? why didn 't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me ?
for now should I have lain down and been quiet . I should have slept , then I would have been at rest ,
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .

so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mourn are exalted to safety .
you shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall know also that your seed shall be great , Your offspring as the grass of the earth .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
" to him who is ready to faint , kindness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
if I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
why do you not pardon my disobedience , and take away my iniquity ? for now shall I lie down in the dust . you will seek me diligently , but I shall not be . "
if it is a matter of strength , behold , he is mighty ! if of justice , ' Who , ' says he , ' will summon me ? '
though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . though I am blameless , it shall prove me perverse .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and cheer up ; '
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
although you know that I am not wicked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! for true wisdom has two sides . know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves .
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Yes , you shall be steadfast , and shall not fear :
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . yes , who doesn 't know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
who doesn 't know that in all these , the hand of Yahweh has done this ,
behold , he breaks down , and it can 't be built again . he imprisons a man , and there can be no release .
behold , he Withholds the waters , and they dry up . again , he sends them out , and they overturn the earth .
he removes the speech of those who are trusted , and takes away the understanding of the elders .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can 't pass ;
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the waters wear the stones . the torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth . so you destroy the hope of man .
his sons come to honor , and he doesn 't know it . they are brought low , but he doesn 't perceive it of them .
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor .
he doesn 't believe that he shall return out of darkness . he is waited for by the sword .
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
he has lived in desolate cities , in houses which no one inhabited , which were ready to become heaps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness . the flame shall dry up his branches . by the breath of God 's mouth shall he go away .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree .
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,

they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his archers surround me . he splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he pours out my gall on the ground .

he has swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again . God will cast them out of his belly .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
for he has oppressed and forsaken the poor . he has violently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him .

he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
my foot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I haven 't gone back from the commandment of his lips . I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
behold , as wild donkeys in the desert , they go forth to their work , seeking diligently for food . the wilderness yields them bread for their children .

for it hurls at him , and does not spare , as he flees away from his hand .
he breaks open a Shaft away from where people live . they are forgotten by the foot . they hang far from men , they swing back and forth .
he binds the streams that they don 't trickle . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
he establishes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
the voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth .
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commended me :
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me , and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any defilement has stuck to my hands ,
then let me sow , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
for that would be a heinous crime . yes , it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges :
" if I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant , when they contended with me ;
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , because I saw my help in the gate ,
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade , and my arm be broken from the bone .
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
" behold , I waited for your words , and I listened for your reasoning , while you searched out what to say .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed . I will open my lips and answer .
please don 't let me respect any man 's person , neither will I give flattering titles to any man .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
" surely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , in slumbering on the bed ;
for the work of a man he will render to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the afflicted .
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righteousness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? '
if you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
" by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out . they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty .
how much less when you say you don 't see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
he doesn 't preserve the life of the wicked , but gives to the afflicted their right .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
after it a voice roars . he thunders with the voice of his majesty . he doesn 't hold back anything when his voice is heard .
for he says to the snow , ' Fall on the earth ; ' likewise to the shower of rain , and to the showers of his mighty rain .
now men don 't see the light which is bright in the skies , but the wind passes , and clears them .
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the wilderness , in which there is no man ;
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray Frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don 't return again .
will you confide in him , that he will bring home your seed , and gather the grain of your threshing floor ?
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
he eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet .
on the cliff he dwells , and makes his home , on the point of the cliff , and the stronghold .
pour out the fury of your anger . look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low .
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can 't be pulled apart .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can 't be moved .
you asked , ' Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand , things too wonderful for me , which I didn 't know .
it was so , that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job , Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite , " My wrath is kindled against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job has .
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . whatever he does shall prosper .
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take counsel together , against Yahweh , and against his Anointed , saying ,
give sincere Homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . > > Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side .
arise , Yahweh ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments . a Psalm by David . > > answer me when I call , God of my righteousness . give me relief from my distress . have mercy on me , and hear my prayer .
< < For the Chief Musician , with the flutes . a Psalm by David . > > Give ear to my words , Yahweh . consider my meditation .
Yahweh , in the morning you shall hear my voice . in the morning I will lay my requests before you , and will watch expectantly .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments , upon the eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your anger , neither discipline me in your wrath .
< < A meditation by David , which he sang to Yahweh , concerning the words of Cush , the Benjamite . > > Yahweh , my God , I take refuge in you . save me from all those who pursue me , and deliver me ,
if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me ( yes , if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary ) ,
let the enemy pursue my soul , and overtake it ; yes , let him tread my life down to the earth , and lay my glory in the dust . Selah .
the trouble he causes shall return to his own head . his violence shall come down on the crown of his own head .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , our Lord , how majestic is your name in all the earth , who has set your glory above the heavens !
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Death of the Son . " a Psalm by David . > > I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart . I will tell of all your marvelous works .
the nations have sunk down in the pit that they made . in the net which they hid , their own foot is taken .
his ways are prosperous at all times . he is haughty , and your laws are far from his sight . as for all his adversaries , he sneers at them .
he lies in wait near the villages . from ambushes , he murders the innocent . his eyes are secretly set against the helpless .
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
Yahweh , you have heard the desire of the humble . you will prepare their heart . you will cause your ear to hear ,
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
for , behold , the wicked bend their bows . they set their arrows on the strings , that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart .
Yahweh is in his holy temple . Yahweh is on his throne in heaven . his eyes observe . his eyes examine the children of men .
< < For the Chief Musician ; upon an eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm of David . > > Help , Yahweh ; for the godly man ceases . for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
" because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy , I will now arise , " says Yahweh ; " I will set him in safety from those who malign him . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > The fool has said in his heart , " There is no God . " they are corrupt . they have done abominable works . there is none who does good .
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on Yahweh ?
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who doesn 't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ;
in whose eyes a vile man is despised , but who honors those who fear Yahweh ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts , and doesn 't change ;
he who doesn 't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
< < A Poem by David . > > Preserve me , God , for in you do I take refuge .
as for the saints who are in the earth , they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight .
their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god . their drink offerings of blood I will not offer , nor take their names on my lips .
I have set Yahweh always before me . because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , my righteous plea ; Give ear to my prayer , that doesn 't go out of deceitful lips .
you have proved my heart . you have visited me in the night . you have tried me , and found nothing . I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey .
as for the works of men , by the word of your lips , I have kept myself from the ways of the violent .
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower .
in my distress I called on Yahweh , and cried to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry before him came into his ears .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tried . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your right hand sustains me . your gentleness has made me great .
I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . they shall fall under my feet .
you have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me . the foreigners shall submit themselves to me .
he rescues me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The heavens declare the glory of God . the expanse shows his handiwork .
their voice has gone out through all the earth , their words to the end of the world . in them he has set a tent for the sun ,
his going forth is from the end of the heavens , his circuit to its ends ; There is nothing hidden from its heat .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble . May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high ,
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The king rejoices in your strength , Yahweh ! how greatly he rejoices in your salvation !
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall devour them .
< < For the Chief Musician ; set to " The Doe of the Morning . " a Psalm by David . > > My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? why are you so far from helping me , and from the words of my groaning ?
I am poured out like water . all my bones are out of joint . my heart is like wax ; it is melted within me .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd . my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . you have brought me into the dust of death .
for he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted , Neither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cried to him , he heard .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for you are with me . your rod and your staff , they comfort me .
you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . you anoint my head with oil . my cup runs over .
< < A Psalm by David . > > The earth is Yahweh 's , with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
my God , I have trusted in you . Don 't let me be shamed . Don 't let my enemies triumph over me .
Don 't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your Goodness ' sake , Yahweh .
< < By David . > > Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering .
< < By David . > > Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
though an army should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear . though war should rise against me , even then I will be confident .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me . I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to Yahweh .
Don 't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , for false witnesses have risen up against me , such as breathe out cruelty .
I am still confident of this : I will see the Goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living .
< < By David . > > To you , Yahweh , I call . my rock , don 't be deaf to me ; lest , if you are silent to me , I would become like those who go down into the pit .
hear the voice of my petitions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place .
give them according to their work , and according to the wickedness of their doings . give them according to the operation of their hands . bring back on them what they deserve .
Yahweh is my strength and my shield . my heart has trusted in him , and I am helped . therefore my heart greatly rejoices . with my song I will thank him .
< < A Psalm . a Song for the Dedication of the Temple . by David . > > I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me .
Yahweh , you have brought up my soul from Sheol . you have kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
you have turned my mourning into dancing for me . you have removed my sackcloth , and clothed me with gladness ,
to the end that my heart may sing praise to you , and not be silent . Yahweh my God , I will give thanks to you forever !
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . you have known my soul in adversities .
you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy . you have set my feet in a large place .
have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am in distress . my eye , my soul , and my body waste away with grief .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me .
Oh how great is your Goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
as for me , I said in my haste , " I am cut off from before your eyes . " nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you .
I acknowledged my sin to you . I didn 't hide my iniquity . I said , I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh , and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go . I will counsel you with my eye on you .
Don 't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you .
Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing . he makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect .
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart , and saves those who have a crushed spirit .
< < By David . > > contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . fight against those who fight against me .
let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor . let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
let destruction come on him unawares . let his net that he has hidden catch himself . let him fall into that destruction .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
but in my adversity , they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together . the attackers gathered themselves together against me , and I didn 't know it . they tore at me , and didn 't cease .
Don 't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me ; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes .
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
< < For the Chief Musician . by David , the servant of Yahweh . > > An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : " there is no fear of God before his eyes . "
he plots iniquity on his bed . he sets himself in a way that is not good . he doesn 't abhor evil .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house . you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures .
Don 't let the foot of pride come against me . Don 't let the hand of the wicked drive me away .
there the workers of iniquity are fallen . they are thrust down , and shall not be able to rise .
< < By David . > > Don 't fret because of evildoers , neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness .
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
they shall not be disappointed in the time of evil . in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are Cursed by him shall be cut off .
wait for Yahweh , and keep his way , and he will exalt you to inherit the land . when the wicked are cut off , you shall see it .
but he passed away , and behold , he was not . yes , I sought him , but he could not be found .
< < A Psalm by David , for a memorial . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
my heart throbs . my strength fails me . as for the light of my eyes , it has also left me .
but I , as a deaf man , don 't hear . I am as a mute man who doesn 't open his mouth .
< < For the Chief Musician . for Jeduthun . a Psalm by David . > > I said , " I will watch my ways , so that I don 't sin with my tongue . I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > I waited patiently for Yahweh . he turned to me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . he set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh .
blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn 't respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it . let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil .
Yahweh will preserve him , and keep him alive . he shall be blessed on the earth , and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies .
yes , my own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , who ate bread with me , has lifted up his heel against me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a contemplation by the sons of Korah . > > As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God .
Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime . in the night his song shall be with me : a prayer to the God of my life .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . a contemplative psalm . > > We have heard with our ears , God ; our fathers have told us , what work you did in their days , in the days of old .
for they didn 't get the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favorable to them .
through you , will we push down our adversaries . through your name , will we tread them under who rise up against us .
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Lilies . " a contemplation by the sons of Korah . a wedding song . > > My heart overflows with a noble theme . I recite my verses for the king . my tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . according to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term . > > God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore we won 't be afraid , though the earth changes , though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas ;
there is a river , the streams of which make the city of God glad , the holy place of the tents of the Most High .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . he burns the chariots in the fire .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Oh clap your hands , all you nations . shout to God with the voice of triumph !
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , is Mount Zion , on the north sides , the city of the great King .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Hear this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
they are appointed as a flock for Sheol . death shall be their shepherd . the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning . their beauty shall decay in Sheol , far from their mansion .
Don 't be afraid when a man is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased .
he calls to the heavens above , to the earth , that he may judge his people :
if I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world is mine , and all that is in it .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
whoever offers the sacrifice of Thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David , when Nathan the prophet came to him , after he had gone in to Bathsheba . > > Have mercy on me , God , according to your loving kindness . according to the multitude of your tender mercies , blot out my transgressions .
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
but as for me , I am like a green olive tree in God 's house . I trust in God 's loving kindness forever and ever .
I will give you thanks forever , because you have done it . I will hope in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your saints .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Mahalath . " a contemplation by David . > > The fool has said in his heart , " There is no God . " they are corrupt , and have done abominable iniquity . there is no one who does good .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on God ?
there they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you . you have put them to shame , because God has rejected them .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David , when the Ziphites came and said to Saul , " Isn 't David hiding himself among us ? " > > Save me , God , by your name . vindicate me in your might .
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven 't set God before them . Selah .
with a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Yahweh , for it is good .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David . > > listen to my prayer , God . Don 't hide yourself from my supplication .
because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . for they bring suffering on me . in anger they hold a grudge against me .
behold , then I would wander far off . I would lodge in the wilderness . " Selah .
for it was not an enemy who insulted me , then I could have endured it . neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me , then I would have hidden myself from him .
but you , God , will bring them down into the pit of destruction . bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days , but I will trust in you .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Silent Dove in distant Lands . " a poem by David , when the Philistines seized him in Gath . > > Be merciful to me , God , for man wants to swallow me up . all day long , he attacks and oppresses me .
in God , I praise his word . in God , I put my trust . I will not be afraid . what can flesh do to me ?
for you have delivered my soul from death , and prevented my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David , when he fled from Saul , in the cave . > > Be merciful to me , God , be merciful to me , for my soul takes refuge in you . yes , in the shadow of your wings , I will take refuge , until disaster has passed .
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
my soul is among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David . > > Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ?
let them be like a snail which melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David , when Saul sent , and they watched the house to kill him . > > Deliver me from my enemies , my God . set me on high from those who rise up against me .
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter .
but I will sing of your strength . yes , I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning . for you have been my high tower , a refuge in the day of my distress .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The Lily of the Covenant . " a teaching poem by David , when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah , and Joab returned , and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt . > > God , you have rejected us . you have broken us down . you have been angry . restore us , again .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . for a stringed instrument . by David . > > Hear my cry , God . listen to my prayer .
from the end of the earth , I will call to you , when my heart is overwhelmed . lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthan . a Psalm by David . > > My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
with God is my salvation and my honor . the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
< < A Psalm by David , when he was in the desert of Judah . > > God , you are my God . I will earnestly seek you . my soul thirsts for you . my flesh longs for you , in a dry and weary land , where there is no water .
but those who seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the Goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
< < For the Chief Musician . a song . a Psalm . > > Make a joyful shout to God , all the earth !
you allowed men to ride over our heads . we went through fire and through water , but you brought us to the place of abundance .
< < For the Chief Musician . with stringed instruments . a Psalm . a song . > > May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . a song . > > Let God arise ! let his enemies be scattered ! let them who hate him also flee before him .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away . as wax melts before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
the earth trembled . the sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai-- at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
the chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands . the Lord is among them , from Sinai , into the sanctuary .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
to him who rides on the heaven of heavens , which are of old ; behold , he utters his voice , a mighty voice .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Lilies . " by David . > > Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head . those who want to cut me off , being my enemies wrongfully , are mighty . I have to restore what I didn 't take away .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
Don 't let the flood waters overwhelm me , neither let the deep swallow me up . Don 't let the pit shut its mouth on me .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
they also gave me gall for my food . in my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink .
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . a reminder . > > hurry , God , to deliver me . come quickly to help me , Yahweh .
be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go . give the command to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress .
I have relied on you from the womb . you are he who took me out of my mother 's womb . I will always praise you .
my mouth will tell about your righteousness , and of your salvation all day , though I don 't know its full measure .
I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh . I will make mention of your righteousness , even of yours alone .
yes , even when I am old and gray @-@ haired , God , don 't forsake me , until I have declared your strength to the next generation , your might to everyone who is to come .
you , who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . you will bring us up again from the depths of the earth .
my tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long , for they are disappointed , and they are confounded , who want to harm me .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
they shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . men shall pray for him continually . they shall bless him all day long .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > God , why have you rejected us forever ? why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ?
remember your Congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
you divided the sea by your strength . you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters .
Don 't forget the voice of your adversaries . the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > We give thanks to you , God . we give thanks , for your Name is near . men tell about your wondrous works .
for in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup , full of foaming wine mixed with spices . he pours it out . indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah .
you , even you , are to be feared . who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthun . a Psalm by Asaph . > > My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and didn 't get tired . my soul refused to be comforted .
the voice of your Thunder was in the whirlwind . the lightnings lit up the world . the earth trembled and shook .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
we will not hide them from their children , telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh , his strength , and his wondrous works that he has done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
he made a path for his anger . he didn 't spare their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ,
he also drove out the nations before them , allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images .
from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > God , the nations have come into your inheritance . they have defiled your holy temple . they have laid Jerusalem in heaps .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
we have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and derision to those who are around us .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you ; on the kingdoms that don 't call on your name ;
Don 't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us . let your tender mercies speedily meet us , for we are in desperate need .
why should the nations say , " Where is their God ? " let it be known among the nations , before our eyes , that vengeance for your servants ' blood is being poured out .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The Lilies of the Covenant . " a Psalm by Asaph . > > Hear us , shepherd of Israel , you who lead Joseph like a flock , you who sit above the cherubim , shine forth .
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . by Asaph . > > sing aloud to God , our strength ! make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob !
he appointed it in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out over the land of Egypt , I heard a language that I didn 't know .
I am Yahweh , your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . open your mouth wide , and I will fill it .
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
< < A song . a Psalm by Asaph . > > God , don 't keep silent . Don 't keep silent , and don 't be still , God .
do to them as you did to Midian , as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the river Kishon ;
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies !
yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
bring joy to the soul of your servant , for to you , Lord , do I lift up my soul .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
< < A Psalm by the sons of Korah ; a Song . > > His foundation is in the holy mountains .
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . for the Chief Musician . to the tune of " The suffering of affliction . " a contemplation by Heman , the Ezrahite . > > Yahweh , the God of my salvation , I have cried day and night before you .
I am counted among those who go down into the pit . I am like a man who has no help ,
set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can 't escape .
< < A contemplation by Ethan , the Ezrahite . > > I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .
a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones , to be feared above all those who are around him ?
< < A Prayer by Moses , the man of GodThe Hebrew word rendered " God " is " Elohim .. " > > Lord , you have been our dwelling place for all generations .
before the mountains were brought forth , before you had formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , you are God .
for all our days have passed away in your wrath . we bring our years to an end as a sigh .
satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness , that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
let the favor of the Lord our God be on us ; establish the work of our hands for us ; yes , establish the work of our hands .
he will call on me , and I will answer him . I will be with him in trouble . I will deliver him , and honor him .
he has brought on them their own iniquity , and will cut them off in their own wickedness . Yahweh , our God , will cut them off .
for he is our God . we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep in his care . today , oh that you would hear his voice !
< < A Psalm . > > sing to Yahweh a new song , for he has done marvelous things ! his right hand , and his holy arm , have worked salvation for him .
he has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel . all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
know that Yahweh , he is God . it is he who has made us , and we are his . we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
< < A Psalm by David . > > I will sing of loving kindness and justice . to you , Yahweh , I will sing praises .
I will be careful to live a blameless life . when will you come to me ? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart .
I will set no vile thing before my eyes . I hate the deeds of Faithless men . they will not cling to me .
my eyes will be on the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me . he who walks in a perfect way , he will serve me .
he who practices deceit won 't dwell within my house . he who speaks falsehood won 't be established before my eyes .
morning by morning , I will destroy all the wicked of the land ; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh 's city .
< < A Prayer of the afflicted , when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh . > > Hear my prayer , Yahweh ! let my cry come to you .
Don 't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
I am like a pelican of the wilderness . I have become as an owl of the waste places .
you will arise and have mercy on Zion ; for it is time to have pity on her . yes , the set time has come .
they will perish , but you will endure . yes , all of them will wear out like a garment . you will change them like a cloak , and they will be changed .
he makes his messengers winds ; his servants flames of fire .
he causes the grass to grow for the livestock , and plants for man to cultivate , that he may bring forth food out of the earth :
you hide your face : they are troubled ; you take away their breath : they die , and return to the dust .
I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live . I will sing praise to my God while I have any being .
and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute ; to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
our fathers didn 't understand your wonders in Egypt . they didn 't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses , but were rebellious at the sea , even at the Red Sea .
he rebuked the Red Sea also , and it was dried up ; so he led them through the depths , as through a desert .
he saved them from the hand of him who hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Moses , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , so that he wouldn 't destroy them .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . the land was polluted with blood .
and gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .
they mount up to the sky ; they go down again to the depths . their soul melts away because of trouble .
they reel back and forth , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people , and praise him in the seat of the elders .
he blesses them also , so that they are multiplied greatly . he doesn 't allow their livestock to decrease .
< < A Song . a Psalm by David . > > My heart is steadfast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > God of my praise , don 't remain silent ,
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh . Don 't let the sin of his mother be blotted out .
yes , he loved cursing , and it came to him . he didn 't delight in blessing , and it was far from him .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
he will judge among the nations . he will heap up dead bodies . he will crush the ruler of the whole earth .
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same , Yahweh 's name is to be praised .
not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .
they have hands , but they don 't feel . they have feet , but they don 't walk , neither do they speak through their throat .
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
because he has turned his ear to me , therefore I will call on him as long as I live .
open to me the gates of righteousness . I will enter into them . I will give thanks to Yah .
blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh ! we have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh .
you are my God , and I will give thanks to you . you are my God , I will exalt you .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > I will lift up my eyes to the hills . where does my help come from ?
< < A Song of Ascents . > > To you I do lift up my eyes , you who sit in the heavens .
behold , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes look to Yahweh , our God , until he has mercy on us .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , with the contempt of the proud .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , let Israel now say ,
our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler 's snare . the snare is broken , and we have escaped .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion , which can 't be moved , but remains forever .
for the scepter of wickedness won 't remain over the allotment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won 't use their hands to do evil .
< < A Song of Ascents . by Solomon . > > Unless Yahweh builds the house , they labor in vain who build it . unless Yahweh watches over the city , the watchman guards it in vain .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to stay up late , eating the bread of toil ; for he gives sleep to his loved ones .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh , who walks in his ways .
for you will eat the labor of your hands . you will be happy , and it will be well with you .
your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the innermost parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up . let Israel now say ,
with which the reaper doesn 't fill his hand , nor he who binds sheaves , his bosom .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Out of the depths I have cried to you , Yahweh .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > Yahweh , my heart isn 't haughty , nor my eyes lofty ; nor do I concern myself with great matters , or things too wonderful for me .
" surely I will not come into the structure of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity !
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
praise Yah ! praise the name of Yahweh ! praise him , you servants of Yahweh ,
who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth ; who makes lightnings with the rain ; who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries ;
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down . yes , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
< < By David . > > I will give you thanks with my whole heart . before the gods , I will sing praises to you .
I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth ; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , you will revive me . you will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies . your right hand will save me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , you have searched me , and you know me .
if I ascend up into heaven , you are there . if I make my bed in Sheol , behold , you are there !
my frame wasn 't hidden from you , when I was made in secret , woven together in the depths of the earth .
your eyes saw my body . in your book they were all written , the days that were ordained for me , when as yet there were none of them .
if I would count them , they are more in number than the sand . when I wake up , I am still with you .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Deliver me , Yahweh , from the evil man . preserve me from the violent man ;
the proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Selah .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
Don 't incline my heart to any evil thing , to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity . Don 't let me eat of their delicacies .
let the righteous strike me , it is kindness ; let him reprove me , it is like oil on the head ; don 't let my head refuse it ; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds .
their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock . they will hear my words , for they are well spoken .
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me , from the traps of the workers of iniquity .
< < A contemplation by David , when he was in the cave . a Prayer . > > I cry with my voice to Yahweh . with my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , you knew my path . in the way in which I walk , they have hidden a snare for me .
look on my right , and see ; for there is no one who is concerned for me . refuge has fled from me . no one cares for my soul .
bring my soul out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name . the righteous will surround me , for you will be good to me .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
hurry to answer me , Yahweh . my spirit fails . Don 't hide your face from me , so that I don 't become like those who go down into the pit .
cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you .

if a wise man goes to court with a foolish man , the fool rages or scoffs , and there is no peace .
whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul . he takes an oath , but dares not testify .
the fear of man proves to be a snare , but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe .
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Who is Yahweh ? ' or lest I be poor , and steal , and so dishonor the name of my God .
there is a generation whose teeth are like swords , and their jaws like knives , to devour the poor from the earth , and the needy from among men .
" the eye that mocks at his father , and scorns obedience to his mother : the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , the young eagles shall eat it .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maiden .
for as the churning of milk brings forth butter , and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
it is not for kings , Lemuel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes to say , ' Where is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and behold , all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
I also gathered silver and gold for myself , and the treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got myself male and female singers , and the delights of the sons of men--musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked , and at the labor that I had labored to do ; and behold , all was vanity and a chasing after wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
for of the wise man , even as of the fool , there is no memory for ever , since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten . indeed , the wise man must die just like the fool !
who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool ? yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is vanity .
therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun .
for all his days are sorrows , and his travail is grief ; yes , even in the night his heart takes no rest . this also is vanity .
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set eternity in their hearts , yet so that man can 't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that wickedness was there .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
there was no end of all the people , even of all them over whom he was--yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him . surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools , for they don 't know that they do evil .
Don 't be rash with your mouth , and don 't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
when you vow a vow to God , don 't defer to pay it ; for he has no pleasure in fools . pay that which you vow .
Don 't allow your mouth to lead you into sin . Don 't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
he who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he who loves abundance , with increase : this also is vanity .
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eats little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep .
as he came forth from his mother 's womb , naked shall he go again as he came , and shall take nothing for his labor , which he may carry away in his hand .
for what advantage has the wise more than the fool ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
better is the end of a thing than its beginning . the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , and in the day of adversity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of vanity : there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
for he doesn 't know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the wicked buried . indeed they came also from holiness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow ; because he doesn 't fear God .
there is a vanity which is done on the earth , that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked . again , there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
when I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes ) ,
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don 't know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their envy has perished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in Sheol , where you are going .
for man also doesn 't know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .
dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor ; so does a little Folly outweigh wisdom and honor .
yes also , when the fool walks by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fool .
he who digs a pit may fall into it ; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of nobles , and your princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
Don 't curse the king , no , not in your thoughts ; and don 't curse the rich in your bedroom : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has wings may tell the matter .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
as you don 't know what is the way of the wind , nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child ; even so you don 't know the work of God who does all .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don 't withhold your hand ; for you don 't know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him rejoice in them all ; but let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . all that comes is vanity .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the grinding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the daughters of music shall be brought low ;
before the silver cord is severed , or the golden bowl is broken , or the pitcher is broken at the spring , or the wheel broken at the cistern ,
Don 't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven 't kept my own vineyard .
tell me , you whom my soul loves , where you graze your flock , where you rest them at noon ; For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions ? Lover
if you don 't know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the sheep . Graze your young goats beside the shepherds ' tents .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he glances through the lattice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the flowers appear on the earth . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land .
the fig tree ripens her green figs . the vines are in blossom . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " Lover
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I had scarcely passed from them , when I found him whom my soul loves . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , into the room of her who conceived me .
they all handle the sword , and are expert in war . every man has his sword on his thigh , because of fear in the night .
he made its pillars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of purple , its midst being paved with love , from the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . Lover
your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is bereaved among them .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense .
come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
you have ravished my heart , my sister , my bride . you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your neck .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices !
your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
I have taken off my robe . indeed , must I put it on ? I have washed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
I rose up to open for my beloved . my hands dripped with myrrh , my fingers with liquid myrrh , on the handles of the lock .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved left ; and had gone away . my heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I didn 't find him . I called him , but he didn 't answer .
the watchmen who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bruised me . the keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me .
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower .
how beautiful are your feet in sandals , prince 's daughter ! your rounded thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a skillful workman .
your body is like a round goblet , no mixed wine is wanting . your waist is like a heap of wheat , set about with lilies .
your neck is like an Ivory tower . your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim . your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus .
I said , " I will climb up into the palm tree . I will take hold of its fruit . " let your breasts be like clusters of the vine , the smell of your breath like apples , beloved
let 's go early up to the vineyards . let 's see whether the vine has budded , its blossom is open , and the pomegranates are in flower . there I will give you my love .
Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruct me . I would have you drink spiced wine , of the juice of my pomegranate .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
many waters can 't quench love , neither can floods drown it . if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be utterly scorned . friends
we have a little sister . she has no breasts . what shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ?
if she is a wall , we will build on her a turret of silver. if she is a door , we will enclose her with boards of cedar . beloved
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
your country is desolate . your cities are burned with fire . Strangers devour your land in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , like a hut in a field of melons , like a besieged city .
unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant , we would have been as Sodom ; we would have been like Gomorrah .
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
when you spread forth your hands , I will hide my eyes from you . yes , when you make many prayers , I will not hear . your hands are full of blood .
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
your princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don 't judge the fatherless , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yahweh 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hills ; and all nations shall flow to it .
he will judge between the nations , and will decide concerning many peoples ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
for you have forsaken your people , the house of Jacob , because they are filled from the east , with those who practice divination like the Philistines , and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
enter into the rock , and hide in the dust , from before the terror of Yahweh , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man will be brought low , the haughtiness of men will be bowed down , and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clothing , you be our ruler , and let this ruin be under your hand . "
in that day he will cry out , saying , " I will not be a healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing . you shall not make me ruler of the people . "
Woe to the wicked ! disaster is upon them ; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him .
moreover Yahweh said , " Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes , walking to trip as they go , jingling ornaments on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion , and Yahweh will make their scalps bald . "
it shall happen that instead of sweet spices , there shall be rottenness ; instead of a belt , a rope ; instead of well set hair , baldness ; instead of a robe , a wearing of sackcloth ; and branding instead of beauty .
it will happen , that he who is left in Zion , and he who remains in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem ;
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
I will lay it a wasteland . it won 't be pruned nor hoed , but it will grow briers and thorns . I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it . "
for the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
Woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
Woe to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inflames them !
the harp , Lyre , tambourine , and flute , with wine , are at their feasts ; but they don 't respect the work of Yahweh , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire , and opened its mouth without measure ; and their glory , their multitude , their pomp , and he who rejoices among them , descend into it .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come speedily and swiftly .
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
their roaring will be like a lioness . they will roar like young lions . yes , they shall roar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea . if one looks to the land behold , darkness and distress . the light is darkened in its clouds .
in the year that king Uzziah died , I saw the Lord sitting on a throne , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temple .
then one of the seraphim flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
make the heart of this people fat . make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn again , and be healed . "
and Yahweh has removed men far away , and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
if there is a tenth left in it , that also will in turn be consumed : as a terebinth , and as an oak , whose stock remains when they are felled ; so the holy seed is its stock . "
it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is allied with Ephraim . " his heart trembled , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind .
then Yahweh said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet Ahaz , you , and Shearjashub your son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field .
" let 's go up against Judah , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its midst , even the son of Tabeel . "
for the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within sixty @-@ five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces , so that it shall not be a people ;
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the desolate valleys , in the clefts of the rocks , on all Thorn hedges , and on all pastures .
in that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of Assyria , the head and the hair of the feet ; and it shall also consume the beard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall happen , that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter : for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land .
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels , shall be for briers and thorns .
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
for before the child knows how to say , ' My father , ' and , ' My mother , ' the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria . "
now therefore , behold , the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River : the king of Assyria and all his glory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
take counsel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" Don 't say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terrorized .
Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dread .
I will wait for Yahweh , who hides his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
when they tell you , " consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards , who chirp and who mutter : " shouldn 't a people consult with their God ? should they consult the dead on behalf of the living ?
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don 't speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
they will pass through it , very distressed and hungry ; and it will happen that when they are hungry , they will worry , and curse by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces upward ,
the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has shined .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Wonderful , counselor , mighty God , Everlasting Father , Prince of Peace .
for wickedness burns like a fire . it devours the briers and thorns ; yes , it kindles in the thickets of the forest , and they roll upward in a column of smoke .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
one will devour on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers who write oppressive decrees ;
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
however he doesn 't mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria , and the insolence of his haughty looks .
should an axe brag against him who chops with it ? should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it ? as if a rod should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
it will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
this very day he will halt at Nob . he shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
the Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him : the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
but with righteousness he will judge the poor , and decide with equity for the humble of the earth . he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth ; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked .
the wolf will live with the lamb , and the Leopard will lie down with the young goat ; The calf , the young lion , and the fattened calf together ; and a little child will lead them .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse , who stands as a banner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be glorious .
he will set up a banner for the nations , and will assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
they will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west . together they will plunder the children of the east . they will extend their power over Edom and Moab , and the children of Ammon will obey them .
behold , God is my salvation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Yah , Yahweh , is my strength and song ; and he has become my salvation . "
set up a banner on the bare mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
the noise of a multitude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together ! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
they will be dismayed . pangs and sorrows will seize them . they will be in pain like a woman in labor . they will look in amazement one at another . their faces will be faces of flame .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light . the sun will be darkened in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to shine .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .
therefore I will make the heavens tremble , and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , and in the day of his fierce anger .
it will happen that like a hunted gazelle , and like sheep that no one gathers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be ransacked , and their wives raped .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not delight in it .
their bows will dash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb . their eyes will not spare children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
for Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreigner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jacob .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh 's land for servants and for handmaids . they will take as captives those whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . Maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will ascend into heaven ! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers , that they not rise up and possess the earth , and fill the surface of the world with cities .
" I will also make it a possession for the porcupine , and pools of water . I will sweep it with the Broom of destruction , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn , saying , " surely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and tread him under foot on my mountains . then his yoke will leave them , and his burden leave their shoulders .
Don 't rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the serpent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent .
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
they have gone up to Bayith , and to Dibon , to the high places , to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba . Baldness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
Heshbon cries out with Elealeh . their voice is heard even to Jahaz . therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud . their souls tremble within them .
my heart cries out for Moab ! her nobles flee to Zoar , to Eglath Shelishiyah ; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping ; for in the way of Horonaim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of Nimrim will be desolate ; for the grass has withered away , the tender grass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Brook of the willows .
for the waters of Dimon are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dimon , a lion on those of Moab who escape , and on the remnant of the land .
for it will be that as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon .
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
for the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jazer , which wandered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah . I will water you with my tears , Heshbon , and Elealeh : for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken . they will be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" it will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh will become lean .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
in that day , people will look to their Maker , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the altars , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made , either the Asherim , or the incense altars .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were forsaken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a desolation .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebuke them , and they will flee far off , and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whirling dust before the storm .
at evening , behold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who plunder us , and the lot of those who rob us .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for before the harvest , when the blossom is over , and the flower becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
they will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains , and for the animals of the earth . the ravenous birds will summer on them , and all the animals of the earth will winter on them .
the burden of Egypt : " behold , Yahweh rides on a swift cloud , and comes to Egypt . the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
the rivers will become foul . the streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up . the reeds and flags will wither away .
the meadows by the Nile , by the brink of the Nile , and all the sown fields of the Nile , will become dry , be driven away , and be no more .
the pillars will be broken in pieces . all those who work for hire will be grieved in soul .
the princes of Zoan have become fools . the princes of Memphis are deceived . they have caused Egypt to go astray , who are the cornerstone of her tribes .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies , which he determines against it .
in that day , there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to Yahweh at its border .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors , and he will send them a Savior and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Yahweh will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vow a vow to Yahweh , and will perform it .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria ; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
therefore my thighs are filled with anguish . pains have taken hold on me , like the pains of a woman in labor . I am in so much pain that I can 't hear . I so am dismayed that I can 't see .
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " Within a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the glory of Kedar will fail ,
and the residue of the number of the archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , will be few ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
he took away the covering of Judah ; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
you also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool . but you didn 't look to him who had done this , neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago .
'What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have dug out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock ! "
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the chariots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
the burden of Tyre . Howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the merchants of Sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
it will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king . after the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
for it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples , as the shaking of an olive tree , as the gleanings when the vintage is done .
it will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit ; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare ; for the windows on high are opened , and the foundations of the earth tremble .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the earth on the earth .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
as the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers ; as the heat by the shade of a cloud , the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth , for Yahweh has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " behold , this is our God ! we have waited for him , and he will save us ! this is Yahweh ! we have waited for him . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation ! "
for in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest . Moab will be trodden down in his place , even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill .
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
for he has brought down those who dwell on high , the lofty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the dust .
yes , in the way of your judgments , Yahweh , have we waited for you . your name and your renown are the desire of our soul .
with my soul have I desired you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly ; for when your judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in pain and cries out in her pangs ; so we have been before you , Yahweh .
we have been with child . we have been in pain . we gave birth , it seems , only to wind . we have not worked any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yourself for a little moment , until the indignation is past .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity . the earth also will disclose her blood , and will no longer cover her slain .
wrath is not in me , but if I should find briers and thorns , I would do battle ! I would march on them and I would burn them together .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in days to come , Jacob will take root . Israel will blossom and bud . they will fill the surface of the world with fruit .
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
when its boughs are withered , they will be broken off . the women will come and set them on fire , for they are a people of no understanding . therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them , and he who formed them will show them no favor .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim , and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine !
behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one . like a storm of hail , a destroying storm , and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing , he will cast them down to the earth with his hand .
they also reel with wine , and stagger with strong drink . the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink . they are swallowed up by wine . they stagger with strong drink . they err in vision . they stumble in judgment .
I will make justice the measuring line , and righteousness the Plumb line . the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters will overflow the hiding place .
your Covenant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand . when the overflowing scourge passes through , then you will be trampled down by it .
as often as it passes through , it will seize you ; for morning by morning it will pass through , by day and by night ; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message . "
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in .
when he has leveled its surface , doesn 't he plant the dill , and scatter the cumin seed , and put in the wheat in rows , the barley in the appointed place , and the spelt in its place ?
for the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin ; but the dill is beaten out with a stick , and the cumin with a rod .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
I will encamp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
you will be brought down , and will speak out of the ground . your speech will mumble out of the dust . your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and your speech will whisper out of the dust .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
for Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep , and has closed your eyes , the prophets ; and he has covered your heads , the seers .
the Lord said , " Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me , but they have removed their heart far from me , and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught ;
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people , even a marvelous work and a wonder ; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish , and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden . "
Isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the deaf will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh , and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
but when he sees his children , the work of my hands , in the midst of him , they will sanctify my name . yes , they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and will stand in awe of the God of Israel .
who set out to go down into Egypt , and have not asked my advice ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt !
therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant .
he will break it as a Potter 's vessel is broken , breaking it in pieces without sparing , so that there won 't be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the Hearth , or to dip up water out of the cistern . "
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain , and like a banner on a hill .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your ears will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
he will give the rain for your seed , with which you will sow the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful . in that day , your livestock will feed in large pastures .
the oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender , which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
there shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard , and will show the descent of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and the flame of a devouring fire , with a blast , storm , and hailstones .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help , and rely on horses , and trust in chariots because they are many , and in horsemen because they are very strong , but they don 't look to the Holy One of Israel , and they don 't seek Yahweh !
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of those who work iniquity .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Yahweh stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stumble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
for in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you .
" the Assyrian will fall by the sword , not of man ; and the sword , not of mankind , shall devour him . he will flee from the sword , and his young men will become subject to forced labor .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the ears of those who hear will listen .
at the noise of the Thunder , the peoples have fled . when you lift yourself up , the nations are scattered .
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can 't comprehend , with a strange language that you can 't understand .
your rigging is untied . they couldn 't strengthen the foot of their mast . they couldn 't spread the sail . then the prey of a great spoil was divided . the lame took the prey .
for Yahweh is enraged against all the nations , and angry with all their armies . he has utterly destroyed them . he has given them over for slaughter .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree .
the wild oxen will come down with them , and the young bulls with the mighty bulls ; and their land will be drunken with blood , and their dust made greasy with fat .
it won 't be quenched night nor day . its smoke will go up forever . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it forever and ever .
but the pelican and the porcupine will possess it . the owl and the raven will dwell in it . he will stretch the line of confusion over it , and the Plumb line of emptiness .
they shall call its nobles to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves , and the wild goat will cry to his fellow . yes , the night creature shall settle there , and shall find herself a place of rest .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , Hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her Mate .
he has cast the lot for them , and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line . they shall possess it forever . from generation to generation they will dwell in it .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
then the eyes of the blind will be opened , and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
the burning sand will become a pool , and the thirsty ground springs of water . grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals , where they lay .
the Yahweh 's ransomed ones will return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy will be on their heads . they will obtain gladness and joy , and sorrow and sighing will flee away . "
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder came out to him .
I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
behold , you trust in the staff of this bruised Reed , even in Egypt , which if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand and Pierce it . so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
Don 't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us . this city won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . " '
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , " Yahweh will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
he heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the children of Eden who were in Telassar ?
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it . then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh 's house , and spread it before Yahweh .
" Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , who is enthroned among the cherubim , you are the God , even you alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . you have made heaven and earth .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities , turning them into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dismayed and confounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green herb , like the grass on the housetops , and like a field before its crop has grown .
because of your raging against me , and because your arrogance has come up into my ears , therefore will I put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came .
this shall be the sign to you . you will eat this year that which grows of itself , and in the second year that which springs from the same ; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He will not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither will he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place .
in those days was Hezekiah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , came to him , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Remember now , Yahweh , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " Hezekiah wept bitterly .
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken .
behold , I will cause the shadow on the sundial , which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun , to return backward ten steps . so the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down . " ' "
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
my dwelling is removed , and is carried away from me like a shepherd 's tent . I have rolled up , like a weaver , my life . he will cut me off from the loom . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
Yahweh will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh .
now Isaiah had said , " Let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a poultice on the boil , and he shall recover . "
at that time , Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
he will feed his flock like a shepherd . he will gather the lambs in his arm , and carry them in his bosom . he will gently lead those who have their young .
who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and marked off the sky with his span , and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
behold , the nations are like a drop in a bucket , and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance . behold , he lifts up the islands like a very little thing .
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
it is he who sits above the circle of the earth , and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers ; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain , and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in ;
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
so the carpenter encourages the goldsmith . he who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil , saying of the soldering , " It is good " ; and he fastens it with nails , that it might not totter .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
Don 't you be afraid , for I am with you . Don 't be dismayed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you . yes , I will help you . yes , I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
you will seek them , and won 't find them , even those who contend with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @-@ existent thing .
for I , Yahweh your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' Don 't be afraid . I will help you . '
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers on the bare heights , and springs in the midst of the valleys . I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
" let them announce , and declare to us what shall happen . declare the former things , what they are , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or show us things to come .
behold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who chooses you is an abomination .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar , and as the Potter treads clay .
who has declared it from the beginning , that we may know ? and before , that we may say , ' He is right ? ' surely , there is no one who declares . surely , there is no one who shows . surely , there is no one who hears your words .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no counselor who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
" behold , my servant , whom I uphold ; my chosen , in whom my soul delights-- I have put my Spirit on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not shout , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
thus says God Yahweh , he who created the heavens and stretched them out , he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it , he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it .
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a Covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
Yahweh will go out like a mighty man . he will stir up zeal like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will shout aloud . he will triumph over his enemies .
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
" those who trust in engraved images , who tell molten images , ' You are our gods ' will be turned back . they will be utterly disappointed .
who is blind , but my servant ? or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send ? who is as blind as he who is at peace , and as blind as Yahweh 's servant ?
who is there among you who will give ear to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him , and the strength of battle ; and it set him on fire all around , but he didn 't know ; and it burned him , but he didn 't take it to heart . "
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scorch you .
since you have been precious and honored in my sight , and I have loved you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
I will tell the north , ' Give them up ! ' and tell the south , ' Don 't hold them back ! bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth--
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
yes , since the day was I am he ; and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand . I will work , and who can hinder it ? "
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : " for your sake , I have sent to Babylon , and I will bring all of them down as fugitives , even the Chaldeans , in the ships of their rejoicing .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don 't you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
I , even I , am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sins .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
one will say , ' I am Yahweh 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Yahweh , ' and honor the name of Israel . "
this is what Yahweh , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , Yahweh of Armies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the workmen are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
the blacksmith takes an axe , works in the coals , fashions it with hammers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hungry , and his strength fails ; he drinks no water , and is faint .
the carpenter stretches out a line . he marks it out with a pencil . he shapes it with planes . he marks it out with compasses , and shapes it like the figure of a man , with the beauty of a man , to reside in a house .
he cuts down cedars for himself , and takes the Cypress and the oak , and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a fir tree , and the rain nourishes it .
the rest of it he makes into a god , even his engraved image . he bows down to it and worships , and prays to it , and says , " Deliver me ; for you are my god ! "
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
he feeds on ashes . a deceived heart has turned him aside ; and he can 't deliver his soul , nor say , " Isn 't there a lie in my right hand ? "
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the rough places smooth . I will break the doors of brass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have surnamed you , though you have not known me .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yahweh , and there is no one else .
thus says Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
" assemble yourselves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image , and pray to a god that can 't save .
I have sworn by myself , the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and will not return , that to me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall take an oath .
they will say of me , ' There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh . ' " even to him shall men come ; and all those who were incensed against him shall be disappointed .
" listen to me , house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , that have been borne from their birth , that have been carried from the womb ;
some pour out gold from the bag , and weigh silver in the balance . they hire a goldsmith , and he makes it a god . they fall down--yes , they worship .
they bear it on the shoulder , they carry it , and set it in its place , and it stands , from its place it shall not move : yes , one may cry to it , yet it can not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed , I will also do it .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
I was angry with my people , I profaned my inheritance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mercy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
for you have trusted in your wickedness ; you have said , No one sees me ; your wisdom and your knowledge , it has perverted you , and you have said in your heart , I am , and there is none else besides me .
" stand now with your enchantments , and with the multitude of your sorceries , in which you have labored from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prevail .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
" hear this , house of Jacob , you who are called by the name of Israel , and have come forth out of the waters of Judah ; who swear by the name of Yahweh , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
therefore I have declared it to you from of old ; before it came to pass I showed it to you ; lest you should say , ' My idol has done them , and my engraved image , and my molten image , has commanded them . '
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
they are created now , and not from of old ; and before this day you didn 't hear them ; lest you should say , ' behold , I knew them . '
yes , you didn 't hear ; yes , you didn 't know ; yes , from of old your ear was not opened : for I knew that you dealt very treacherously , and was called a transgressor from the womb .
for my name 's sake will I defer my anger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand has spread out the heavens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
" come near to me and hear this : " from the beginning I have not spoken in secret ; from the time that it was , there am I. " Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me , with his Spirit .
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yahweh your God , who teaches you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , islands , to me ; and listen , you peoples , from far : Yahweh has called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name :
and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand , he has hidden me : and he has made me a polished Shaft ; in his quiver has he kept me close :
saying to those who are bound , ' Come out ! ' ; to those who are in darkness , ' Show yourselves ! ' " they shall feed in the ways , and on all bare heights shall be their pasture .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
behold , these shall come from far ; and behold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim . "
" for , as for your waste and your desolate places , and your land that has been destroyed , surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who swallowed you up shall be far away .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , " behold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , and set up my banner to the peoples ; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom , and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders .
but thus says Yahweh , " Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; for I will contend with him who contends with you , and I will save your children .
thus says Yahweh , " Where is the bill of your mother 's divorce , with which I have put her away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities were you sold , and for your transgressions was your mother put away .
the Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught , that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary : he wakens morning by morning , he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught .
I gave my back to the strikers , and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair ; I didn 't hide my face from shame and spitting .
for the Lord Yahweh will help me ; therefore I have not been confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be disappointed .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
look to Abraham your father , and to Sarah who bore you ; for when he was but one I called him , and I blessed him , and made him many .
for Yahweh has comforted Zion ; he has comforted all her waste places , and has made her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of Yahweh ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , Thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my righteousness shall be forever , and my salvation to all generations . "
Isn 't it you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over ?
the ransomed of Yahweh shall return , and come with singing to Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads . they shall obtain gladness and joy . sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
" I , even I , am he who comforts you : who are you , that you are afraid of man who shall die , and of the son of man who shall be made as grass ;
the captive exile shall speedily be freed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
awake , awake , stand up , Jerusalem , that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath ; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering , and drained it .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
your sons have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as an antelope in a net ; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh , the rebuke of your God .
thus says your Lord Yahweh , and your God who pleads the cause of his people , " behold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :
and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you , who have said to your soul , ' bow down , that we may walk over you ; ' and you have laid your back as the ground , and as the street , to those who walk over . "
the voice of your watchmen ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yahweh returns to Zion .
Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
depart , depart , go out from there , touch no unclean thing ! go out of the midst of her ! cleanse yourselves , you who bear the vessels of Yahweh .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of dry ground . he has no good looks or majesty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was despised , and rejected by men ; a man of suffering , and acquainted with disease . he was despised as one from whom men hide their face ; and we didn 't respect him .
he was oppressed , yet when he was afflicted he didn 't open his mouth . as a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute , so he didn 't open his mouth .
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
" enlarge the place of your tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations ; don 't spare : lengthen your cords , and strengthen your stakes .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your seed shall possess the nations , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
" Don 't be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be confounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more .
" for this is like the waters of Noah to me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth , so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you , nor rebuke you .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my Covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
I will make your pinnacles of rubies , and your gates of Sparkling jewels , and all your walls of precious stones .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
why do you spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labor for that which doesn 't satisfy ? listen diligently to me , and eat you that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
behold , you shall call a nation that you don 't know ; and a nation that didn 't know you shall run to you , because of Yahweh your God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he has glorified you . "
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and doesn 't return there , but waters the earth , and makes it bring forth and bud , and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth : it shall not return to me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do .
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands .
instead of the Thorn shall come up the fir tree ; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to Yahweh for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off . "
blessed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil . "
neither let the foreigner , who has joined himself to Yahweh , speak , saying , " Yahweh will surely separate me from his people " ; neither let the eunuch say , " behold , I am a dry tree . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my Covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar ; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples . "
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
for thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity , whose name is Holy : " I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the lips : peace , peace , to him who is far off and to him who is near , " says Yahweh ; " and I will heal them . "
" cry aloud , don 't spare , lift up your voice like a trumpet , and declare to my people their disobedience , and to the house of Jacob their sins .
'Why have we fasted , ' say they , ' and you don 't see ? why have we afflicted our soul , and you take no knowledge ? ' " behold , in the day of your fast you find pleasure , and exact all your labors .
behold , you fast for strife and contention , and to strike with the fist of wickedness : you don 't fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
" Isn 't this the fast that I have chosen : to release the bonds of wickedness , to undo the bands of the yoke , and to let the oppressed go free , and that you break every yoke ?
Isn 't it to distribute your bread to the hungry , and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house ? when you see the naked , that you cover him ; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh ?
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth speedily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard .
then you shall call , and Yahweh will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' Here I am . ' " if you take away from the midst of you the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking wickedly ;
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
and Yahweh will guide you continually , and satisfy your soul in dry places , and make strong your bones ; and you shall be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water , whose waters don 't fail .
behold , Yahweh 's hand is not shortened , that it can 't save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can 't hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
the way of peace they don 't know ; and there is no justice in their goings : they have made them crooked paths ; whoever goes therein does not know peace .
we grope for the wall like the blind ; yes , we grope as those who have no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the twilight ; among those who are lusty we are as dead men .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
yes , truth is lacking ; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey . Yahweh saw it , and it displeased him that there was no justice .
he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his own arm brought salvation to him ; and his righteousness , it upheld him .
he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a mantle .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
" as for me , this is my Covenant with them , " says Yahweh . " my Spirit who is on you , and my words which I have put in your mouth , shall not depart out of your mouth , nor out of the mouth of your seed , nor out of the mouth of your seed 's seed , " says Yahweh , " from henceforth and forever . "
for , behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Yahweh will arise on you , and his glory shall be seen on you .
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
" foreigners shall build up your walls , and their kings shall minister to you : for in my wrath I struck you , but in my favor have I had mercy on you .
" the glory of Lebanon shall come to you , the fir tree , the pine , and the box tree together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you ; and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet ; and they shall call you The city of Yahweh , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
for brass I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood brass , and for stones iron . I will also make your officers peace , and righteousness your ruler .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
but you shall be named the priests of Yahweh ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will boast in their glory .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed . "
for as the earth brings forth its bud , and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Yahweh shall name .
you shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh , and a royal diadem in the hand of your God .
Yahweh has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have labored :
but those who have garnered it shall eat it , and praise Yahweh ; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary . "
go through , go through the gates ! prepare the way of the people ! cast up , cast up the highway ! gather out the stones ! lift up a banner for the peoples .
behold , Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth , " Say to the daughter of Zion , ' behold , your salvation comes . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him . ' "
" I have trodden the winepress alone ; and of the peoples there was no man with me : yes , I trod them in my anger , and trampled them in my wrath ; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments , and I have stained all my clothing .
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
I trod down the peoples in my anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth . "
I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh and the praises of Yahweh , according to all that Yahweh has bestowed on us , and the great Goodness toward the house of Israel , which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bore them , and carried them all the days of old .
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
when you did awesome things which we didn 't look for , you came down , the mountains quaked at your presence .
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
for we have all become as one who is unclean , and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment : and we all fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , take us away .
there is none who calls on your name , who stirs up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our iniquities .
but now , Yahweh , you are our Father ; we are the clay , and you our Potter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
" I am inquired of by those who didn 't ask ; I am found by those who didn 't seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create ; for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus says Yahweh , " Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Yahweh : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit , and who trembles at my word .
I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears on them ; because when I called , no one answered ; when I spoke , they didn 't listen ; but they did that which was evil in my eyes , and chose that in which I didn 't delight . "
for thus says Yahweh , " behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream : and you will nurse . you will be carried on her side , and will be dandled on her knees .
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for , behold , Yahweh will come with fire , and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind ; to render his anger with fierceness , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire will Yahweh execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many .
" for as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yahweh , " so your seed and your name shall remain .
" they shall go forth , and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they will be loathsome to all mankind . "
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
" before I formed you in the belly , I knew you . before you came forth out of the womb , I sanctified you . I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . "
but Yahweh said to me , " Don 't say , ' I am a child ; ' for to whoever I shall send you , you shall go , and whatever I shall command you , you shall speak .
then Yahweh put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and Yahweh said to me , " behold , I have put my words in your mouth .
the word of Yahweh came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling caldron ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
for , behold , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , " says Yahweh ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Judah .
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your belt on your waist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . Don 't be dismayed at them , lest I dismay you before them .
" go , and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh , " I remember for you the kindness of your youth , the love of your weddings ; how you went after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown .
the priests didn 't say , ' Where is Yahweh ? ' and those who handle the law didn 't know me . the rulers also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
" for my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
" haven 't you procured this to yourself , in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God , when he led you by the way ?
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shihor ? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria , to drink the waters of the River ?
" for of old time I have broken your yoke , and burst your bonds ; and you said , ' I will not serve ; ' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself , playing the prostitute .
" withhold your foot from being unshod , and your throat from thirst . but you said , ' It is in vain . no , for I have loved strangers , and I will go after them . '
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ;
" but where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah .
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . surely his anger has turned away from me . ' " behold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sinned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be ashamed of Egypt also , as you were ashamed of Assyria .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
I said after she had done all these things , ' She will return to me ; ' but she didn 't return ; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
I saw , when , for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce , yet treacherous Judah , her sister , didn 't fear ; but she also went and played the prostitute .
it happened through the lightness of her prostitution , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
only acknowledge your iniquity , that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Yahweh . "
" return , backsliding children , " says Yahweh ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
at that time they shall call Jerusalem ' The throne of Yahweh ; ' and all the nations shall be gathered to it , to the name of Yahweh , to Jerusalem . neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
a voice is heard on the bare heights , the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel ; because they have perverted their way , they have forgotten Yahweh their God .
truly in vain is help from the hills , the tumult on the mountains . truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God .
and you shall swear , ' As Yahweh lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
a lion is gone up from his thicket , and a destroyer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land desolate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabitant .
" it shall happen at that day , " says Yahweh , " that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall wonder . "
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us ! for we are ruined .
my anguish , my anguish ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart is disquieted in me ; I can 't hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
" for my people are foolish , they don 't know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw the mountains , and behold , they trembled , and all the hills moved back and forth .
for this the earth will mourn , and the heavens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and I have not repented , neither will I turn back from it . "
every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers ; they go into the thickets , and climb up on the rocks : every city is forsaken , and not a man dwells therein .
I will go to the great men , and will speak to them ; for they know the way of Yahweh , and the law of their God . " but these with one accord have broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
" how can I pardon you ? your children have forsaken me , and sworn by what are no gods . when I had fed them to the full , they committed adultery , and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes ' houses .
the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
behold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Yahweh . " it is a mighty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don 't know , neither understand what they say .
they shall eat up your harvest , and your bread , which your sons and your daughters should eat . they shall eat up your flocks and your herds . they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees . they shall beat down your fortified cities , in which you trust , with the sword .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Yahweh our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest . '
they have grown fat . they shine ; yes , they excell in deeds of wickedness . they don 't plead the cause , the cause of the fatherless , that they may prosper ; and they don 't judge the right of the needy .
shepherds with their flocks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they can 't listen . behold , the word of Yahweh has become a reproach to them . they have no delight in it .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yahweh . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superficially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
they take hold of bow and spear . they are cruel , and have no mercy . their voice roars like the sea , and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Zion . "
Don 't go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
the bellows blow fiercely ; the lead is consumed of the fire : in vain do they go on refining ; for the wicked are not plucked away .
for if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
if you don 't oppress the foreigner , the fatherless , and the widow , and don 't shed innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your own hurt :
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even forevermore .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yahweh .
but go now to my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name , in which you trust , and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I did to Shiloh .
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead the dough , to make cakes to the queen of the sky , and to pour out drink offerings to other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
for I didn 't speak to your fathers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing I commanded them , saying , listen to my voice , and I will be your God , and you shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
for the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Yahweh : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I didn 't command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Topheth , until there is no place to bury .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth ; and none shall frighten them away .
then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; for the land shall become a waste .
at that time , says Yahweh , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , out of their graves ;
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yahweh of Armies .
I listened and heard , but they didn 't speak aright : no man repents him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle .
yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don 't know Yahweh 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Yahweh ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives to others , and their fields to those who shall possess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely .
they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , says Yahweh .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mourn ; dismay has taken hold on me .
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for falsehood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don 't know me , says Yahweh .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
who is the wise man , that may understand this ? who is he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken , that he may declare it ? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness , so that none passes through ?
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
thus says Yahweh , Don 't let the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , don 't let the rich man glory in his riches ;
for the customs of the peoples are vanity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman with the axe .
they are like a palm tree , of turned work , and don 't speak : they must be carried , because they can 't go . Don 't be afraid of them ; for they can 't do evil , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it appertains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith ; blue and purple for their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
but Yahweh is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trembles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
when he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he makes lightnings for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries .
every man has become brutish and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of Yahweh : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
the voice of news , behold , it comes , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah a desolation , a dwelling place of jackals .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you , and on the families that don 't call on your name : for they have devoured Jacob , yes , they have devoured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his habitation .
for I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obey my voice .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my Covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus says Yahweh , behold , I will bring evil on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .
Yahweh called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it , and its branches are broken .
for Yahweh of Armies , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you , because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who judges righteously , who tests the heart and the mind , I shall see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remnant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
but you , Yahweh , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have forsaken my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourns to me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man lays it to heart .
Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
they have sown wheat , and have reaped thorns ; they have put themselves to pain , and profit nothing : and you shall be ashamed of your fruits , because of the fierce anger of Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : behold , I will pluck them up from off their land , and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them .
it shall happen , after that I have plucked them up , I will return and have compassion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a cleft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yahweh said to me , arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
this evil people , who refuse to hear my words , who walk in the stubbornness of their heart , and are gone after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this belt , which is profitable for nothing .
I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , says Yahweh : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have compassion , that I should not destroy them .
give glory to Yahweh your God , before he causes darkness , and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains , and , while you look for light , he turns it into the shadow of death , and makes it gross darkness .
but if you will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall weep bitterly , and run down with tears , because Yahweh 's flock is taken captive .
say to the king and to the queen mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headdresses have come down , even the crown of your glory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Judah is carried away captive , all of it ; it is wholly carried away captive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
if you say in your heart , Why are these things come on me ? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered , and your heels suffer violence .
their nobles send their little ones to the waters : they come to the cisterns , and find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are disappointed and confounded , and cover their heads .
because of the ground which is cracked , because no rain has been in the land , the plowmen are disappointed , they cover their heads .
you hope of Israel , its Savior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreigner in the land , and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
why should you be like a scared man , as a mighty man who can 't save ? yet you , Yahweh , are in the midst of us , and we are called by your name ; don 't leave us .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them--them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for I will pour their wickedness on them .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous wound .
have you utterly rejected Judah ? has your soul loathed Zion ? why have you struck us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
then Yahweh said to me , Though Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind would not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh , the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
Yahweh said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
your words were found , and I ate them ; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart : for I am called by your name , Yahweh , God of Armies .
I didn 't sit in the assembly of those who make merry , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Yahweh .
I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible .
for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
neither shall men break bread for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : behold , I will cause to cease out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .
it shall happen , when you shall show this people all these words , and they shall tell you , Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us ? or what is our iniquity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God ?
then you shall tell them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , says Yahweh , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshiped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
and you have done evil more than your fathers ; for , behold , you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , so that you don 't listen to me :
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods day and night ; for I will show you no favor .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that it shall no more be said , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes .
first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things , and have filled my inheritance with their abominations .
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is engraved on the tablet of their heart , and on the horns of your altars ;
my mountain in the field , I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
you , even of yourself , shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don 't know : for you have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
as the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid , so is he who gets riches , and not by right ; in the midst of his days they shall leave him , and at his end he shall be a fool .
Yahweh , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken Yahweh , the spring of living waters .
let them be disappointed who persecute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dismayed , but don 't let me be dismayed ; bring on them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
thus said Yahweh to me : go , and stand in the gate of the children of the people , through which the kings of Judah come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
and tell them , Hear the word of Yahweh , you kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day holy , neither do any work : but make the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
it shall happen , if you diligently listen to me , says Yahweh , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to make the Sabbath day holy , to do no work therein ;
they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places around Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the lowland , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meal offerings , and frankincense , and bringing sacrifices of Thanksgiving , to the house of Yahweh .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the Potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incense to false gods ; and they have been made to stumble in their ways , in the ancient paths , to walk in byways , in a way not built up ;
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and give them over to the power of the sword ; and let their wives become childless , and widows ; and let their men be slain of death , and their young men struck of the sword in battle .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them ; for they have dug a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the gate Harsith , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you ;
and have built the high places of Baal , to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal ; which I didn 't command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that this place shall no more be called Topheth , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter .
I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth .
I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters ; and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend , in the siege and in the distress , with which their enemies , and those who seek their life , shall distress them .
and the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , which are defiled , shall be as the place of Topheth , even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky , and have poured out drink offerings to other gods .
then came Jeremiah from Topheth , where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Yahweh 's house , and said to all the people :
now Pashhur , the son of Immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
moreover I will give all the riches of this city , and all its gains , and all the precious things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall make them a prey , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
for as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Violence and destruction ! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me , and a derision , all the day .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
Cursed is the day in which I was born : Don 't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed .
let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew , and didn 't repent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and shouting at noontime ;
because he didn 't kill me from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
he who remains in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey .
for I have set my face on this city for evil , and not for good , says Yahweh : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , says Yahweh ; and I will kindle a fire in her forest , and it shall devour all that is around her .
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
I will prepare destroyers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
for thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the son of Josiah , king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and doesn 't give him his hire ;
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you didn 't obey my voice .
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
I will cast you out , and your mother who bore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel ? is he a vessel in which none delights ? why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into the land which they don 't know ?
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
I will set up shepherds over them , who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yahweh .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that they shall no more say , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourns ; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up . their course is evil , and their might is not right ;
therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
they say continually to those who despise me , Yahweh has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say , No evil shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yahweh , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth . yes , a whirling storm . it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers forgot my name for Baal .
the prophet who has a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he who has my word , let him speak my word faithfully . what is the straw to the wheat ? says Yahweh .
but if you say , The burden of Yahweh ; therefore thus says Yahweh : because you say this word , The burden of Yahweh , and I have sent to you , saying , You shall not say , The burden of Yahweh ;
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yahweh : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil ; to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , even to this day , these twenty @-@ three years , the word of Yahweh has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not listened .
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
saying , Return now everyone from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers , from of old and even forevermore ;
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the lamp .
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Yahweh , for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans ; and I will make it desolate forever .
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them , even of them ; and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the work of their hands .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Yahweh 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yahweh had sent me :
Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and its kings , and its princes , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , a hissing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : you shall surely drink .
a noise shall come even to the end of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all flesh : as for the wicked , he will give them to the sword , says Yahweh .
the slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be Dung on the surface of the ground .
Wail , you shepherds , and cry ; and wallow in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goodly vessel .
the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from Yahweh , saying ,
thus says Yahweh : stand in the court of Yahweh 's house , and speak to all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in Yahweh 's house , all the words that I command you to speak to them ; don 't diminish a word .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh : if you will not listen to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
it happened , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
when the princes of Judah heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of Yahweh ; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh , Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim ; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uriah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the children of Ammon , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Sidon , by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah ;
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant .
but as for you , don 't you listen to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreams , nor to your soothsayers , nor to your sorcerers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they prophesy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
Don 't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
yes , thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh , and in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem :
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azzur , the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of Yahweh , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , who went to Babylon , says Yahweh ; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
the prophet who prophesies of peace , when the word of the prophet shall happen , then shall the prophet be known , that Yahweh has truly sent him .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , to all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
take wives , and father sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and don 't be diminished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Yahweh for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : Don 't let your prophets who are in the midst of you , and your diviners , deceive you ; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
for thus says Yahweh , After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David , and concerning all the people who dwell in this city , your brothers who haven 't gone forth with you into captivity ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies ; behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
because they have not listened to my words , says Yahweh , with which I sent to them my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yahweh .
Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest , that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh , for every man who is mad , and makes himself a prophet , that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles .
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , and I didn 't send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
ask now , and see whether a man does travail with child : why do I see every man with his hands on his waist , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
it shall come to pass in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , that I will break his yoke from off your neck , and will burst your bonds ; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant ;
all your lovers have forgotten you ; they don 't seek you : for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured ; and all your adversaries , everyone of them , shall go into captivity ; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil , and all who prey on you will I give for a prey .
for I will restore health to you , and I will heal you of your wounds , says Yahweh ; because they have called you an outcast , saying , It is Zion , whom no man seeks after .
thus says Yahweh : behold , I will turn again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have compassion on his dwelling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me ? says Yahweh .
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
again will I build you , and you shall be built , O virgin of Israel : again you shall be adorned with your tambourines , and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry .
again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall enjoy its fruit .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry , arise , and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God .
they shall come with weeping ; and with petitions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stumble ; for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Goodness , says Yahweh .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own iniquity : every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yahweh .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar .
now at that time the king of Babylon 's army was besieging Jerusalem ; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yahweh : though you fight with the Chaldeans , you shall not prosper ?
so I took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel : take these deeds , this deed of the purchase which is sealed , and this deed which is open , and put them in an earthen vessel ; that they may continue many days .
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
great in counsel , and mighty in work ; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men , to give everyone according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yourself a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , says Yahweh .
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
now therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
yes , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yahweh .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
as the army of the sky can 't be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured ; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites who minister to me .
Don 't consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yahweh chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus says Yahweh , behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish and against Azekah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fathers didn 't listen to me , neither inclined their ear .
but you turned and profaned my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom you had let go free at their pleasure , to return ; and you brought them into subjection , to be to you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth .
Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
go to the house of the Rechabites , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yahweh , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
neither shall you build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor have any ; but all your days you shall dwell in tents ; that you may live many days in the land in which you live .
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
but we have lived in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
but it happened , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the scroll , which you have written from my mouth , the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh , and will return everyone from his evil way ; for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people .
Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh 's house .
now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jerusalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem , proclaimed a fast before Yahweh .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh , in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan , the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's room : and behold , all the princes were sitting there , Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe . Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
it happened , when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
they were not afraid , nor tore their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
the king commanded Jerahmeel the king 's son , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but Yahweh hid them .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the scroll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take again another scroll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Judah , who sent you to me to inquire of me : behold , Pharaoh 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
where now are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur the son of Malchijah , heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people , saying ,
thus says Yahweh , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the famine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
so Ebedmelech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there rags and worn @-@ out garments , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Yahweh , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then you shall tell them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and besieged it ;
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
it happened that , when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Arabah .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
moreover he put out Zedekiah 's eyes , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite , they and their men .
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men , saying , Don 't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah , to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fruits and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon , and in Edom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , to Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
and said to him , Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life ? but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn 't believe them .
now it happened in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words ; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you , I will declare it to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up ; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
now therefore hear the word of Yahweh , O remnant of Judah : thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls ; for you sent me to Yahweh your God , saying , pray for us to Yahweh our God ; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Memphis , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
however I sent to you all my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , Oh , don 't do this abominable thing that I hate .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as it is this day .
have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky , and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
so that Yahweh could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without inhabitant , as it is this day .
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
harness the horses , and get up , you horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , put on the coats of mail .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
Egypt rises up like the Nile , and his waters Toss themselves like the rivers : and he says , I will rise up , I will cover the earth ; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
he made many to stumble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they didn 't stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their visitation .
the sound of it shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cutters .
the daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , says : behold , I will punish Amon of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with her gods , and her kings ; even Pharaoh , and those who trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yahweh .
but don 't you be afraid , Jacob my servant , neither be dismayed , Israel : for , behold , I will save you from afar , and your seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers don 't look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;

Moab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his lees , and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .

we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .

on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
he who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring on him , even on Moab , the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .

for thus says Yahweh : behold , they to whom it didn 't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished ? you shall not go unpunished , but you shall surely drink .

their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their livestock a spoil : and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off ; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them , says Yahweh .
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .

they shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it , saying , Come , and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting Covenant that shall not be forgotten .

because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .

go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .

therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there , and the ostriches shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited forever ; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
they lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh , that he has taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely they shall drag them away , even the little ones of the flock ; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh 's hand , who made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shields : Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Yahweh , the vengeance of his temple .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
when he utters his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he makes lightning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries .
every man has become brutish without knowledge . every goldsmith is disappointed by his image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
you are my battle axe and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy kingdoms ;
and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke ; and with you will I break in pieces governors and deputies .
behold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Yahweh , which destroys all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and roll you down from the rocks , and will make you a burnt mountain .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Medes , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dominion .
the land trembles and is in pain ; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without inhabitant .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight , they remain in their strongholds ; their might has failed ; they are become as women : her dwelling places are set on fire ; her bars are broken .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Yahweh .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
though Babylon should mount up to the sky , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall destroyers come to her , says Yahweh .
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
and say , Yahweh , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall dwell therein , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be desolate forever .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates :
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he gave judgment on him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people , and the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
they also took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the basins , the spoons , and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered .
the captain of the guard took away the cups , the fire pans , the basins , the pots , the lampstands , the spoons , and the bowls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
they took the two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh . the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
as for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was Eighteen cubits ; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it ; and its thickness was four fingers . it was hollow .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and pomegranates .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she didn 't remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down wonderfully ; she has no comforter : see , Yahweh , my affliction ; for the enemy has magnified himself .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ; They are knit together , they have come up on my neck ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
for these things I weep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed .
Zion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
let all their wickedness come before you ; Do to them , as you have done to me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
the Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and has not pitied : he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has profaned the kingdom and its princes .
he has cut off in fierce anger all the Horn of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , which devours all around .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the Lord has cast off his altar , he has abhorred his sanctuary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces : they have made a noise in the house of Yahweh , as in the day of a solemn assembly .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ; My liver is poured on the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city .
they tell their mothers , Where is grain and wine ? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their soul is poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They hiss and gnash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
Yahweh has done that which he purposed ; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not pitied : he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you ; he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries .
their heart cried to the Lord : Wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no respite ; don 't let the apple of your eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that faint for hunger at the head of every street .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not pitied .
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me desolate .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
you will render to them a recompense , Yahweh , according to the work of their hands .
how the gold has become dim ! the most pure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street .
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ; They were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was as of sapphire .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
the kings of the earth didn 't believe , neither all the inhabitants of the world , That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem .
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
they hunt our steps , so that we can 't go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus :
their wings were joined one to another ; they didn 't turn when they went ; each one went straight forward .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , like the appearance of torches : the fire went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl : and the four of them had one likeness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up beside them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse , like the awesome crystal to look on , stretched forth over their heads above .
under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
when they went , I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters , like the voice of the Almighty , a noise of tumult like the noise of an army : when they stood , they let down their wings .
there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were glowing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his waist and upward ; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was brightness around him .
he said to me , Son of man , I send you to the children of Israel , to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me . they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house ) , yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard @-@ hearted .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
go to them of the captivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv , that lived by the river Chebar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
yet if you warn the wicked , and he doesn 't turn from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but you have delivered your soul .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and behold , the glory of Yahweh stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
then the Spirit entered into me , and set me on my feet ; and he spoke with me , and said to me , Go , shut yourself inside your house .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with you , I will open your mouth , and you shall tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : he who hears , let him hear ; and he who forbears , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their iniquity .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah : forty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a Barber 's razor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordinances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my ordinances , neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all your abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely , because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things , and with all your abominations , therefore will I also diminish you ; neither shall my eye spare , and I also will have no pity .
when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yahweh : thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills , to the watercourses and to the valleys : behold , I , even I , will bring a sword on you , and I will destroy your high places .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
they shall know that I am Yahweh : I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your abominations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
your doom has come to you , inhabitant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of tumult , and not of joyful shouting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , do strike .
violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness . none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of their wealth . there shall be nothing of value among them .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
the sword is outside , and the pestilence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one in his iniquity .
they shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be on all faces , and baldness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall profane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
Mischief shall come on mischief , and rumor shall be on rumor ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the plain .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said to me , Son of man , do you see what they do ? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but you shall again see yet other great abominations .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , every man with his censer in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women weeping for Tammuz .
he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh 's house ; and see , at the door of Yahweh 's temple , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty @-@ five men , with their backs toward Yahweh 's temple , and their faces toward the east ; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clothed in linen , who had the writer 's inkhorn by his side .
Yahweh said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst .
then he said to me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perversion : for they say , Yahweh has forsaken the land , and Yahweh doesn 't see .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
it came to pass , when he commanded the man clothed in linen , saying , Take fire from between the whirling wheels , from between the cherubim , that he went in , and stood beside a wheel .
the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen , who took it and went out .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they didn 't turn as they went .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
when the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the wheels also didn 't turn from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
the glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
the cherubim lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth , and the wheels beside them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me , and he said to me , Speak , Thus says Yahweh : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : your slain whom you have laid in its midst , they are the meat , and this is the caldron ; but you shall be brought out of its midst .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city , and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house , who have eyes to see , and don 't see , who have ears to hear , and don 't hear ; for they are a rebellious house .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
in their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don 't see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for removing , and in the even I dug through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and bore it on my shoulder in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
tell them therefore , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
haven 't you seen a false vision , and haven 't you spoken a lying divination , in that you say , Yahweh says ; but I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one builds up a wall , behold , they plaster it with whitewash :
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
behold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it ?
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger , and great hailstones in wrath to consume it .
so will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an astonishment , for a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
if the prophet is deceived and speak a word , I , Yahweh , have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
they shall comfort you , when you see their way and their doings ; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , says the Lord Yahweh .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has devoured both its ends , and its midst is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has devoured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall devour them ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I set my face against them .
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
no eye pitied you , to do any of these things to you , to have compassion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was abhorred , in the day that you were born .
when I passed by you , and saw you wallowing in your blood , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live .
I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field , and you increased and grew great , and you attained to excellent ornament ; your breasts were fashioned , and your hair was grown ; yet you were naked and bare .
then washed I you with water ; yes , I thoroughly washed away your blood from you , and I anointed you with oil .
thus you were decked with gold and silver ; and your clothing was of fine linen , and silk , and embroidered work ; you ate fine flour , and honey , and oil ; and you were exceeding beautiful , and you prospered to royal estate .
you took of your garments , and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors , and played the prostitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
my bread also which I gave you , fine flour , and oil , and honey , with which I fed you , you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma ; and [ thus ] it was , says the Lord Yahweh .
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were wallowing in your blood .
you have built your lofty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an abomination , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multiplied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
you have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians , because you were insatiable ; yes , you have played the prostitute with them , and yet you weren 't satisfied .
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
you are different from [ other ] women in your prostitution , in that no one follows you to play the prostitute ; and whereas you give hire , and no hire is given to you , therefore you are different .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , Because your filthiness was poured out , and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers ; and because of all the idols of your abominations , and for the blood of your children , that you gave to them ;
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your vaulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jewels ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and thrust you through with their swords .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
behold , everyone who uses Proverbs shall use [ this ] proverb against you , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
you are the daughter of your mother , who loathes her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , Sodom your sister has not done , she nor her daughters , as you have done , you and your daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither has Samaria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
your sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate .
then you shall remember your ways , and be ashamed , when you shall receive your sisters , your elder [ sisters ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for daughters , but not by your Covenant .
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
and he took of the seed royal , and made a Covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose Covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
for he has despised the oath by breaking the Covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : as I live , surely my oath that he has despised , and my Covenant that he has broken , I will even bring it on his own head .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing ; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has wronged the poor and needy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed abomination ,
who has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , has not defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , robbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , behold , he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he has done he shall live .
again , when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her cubs , and made him a young lion .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
but it was plucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and withered ; the fire consumed them .
fire is gone out of the rods of its branches , it has devoured its fruit , so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter to rule . this is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
it happened in the seventh year , in the fifth [ month ] , the tenth [ day ] of the month , that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh , and sat before me .
son of man , speak to the elders of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : is it to inquire of me that you have come ? as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will not be inquired of by you .
and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day when I chose Israel , and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I swore to them , saying , I am Yahweh your God ;
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
I gave them my statutes , and showed them my ordinances , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ordinances , and didn 't walk in my statutes , and profaned my Sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless my eye spared them , and I didn 't destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness .
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out , will I be king over you :
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant ;
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and those who disobey against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
for in my holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the first fruits of your offerings , with all your holy things .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I swore to give to your fathers .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your doings , in which you have polluted yourselves ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South ;
then I said , Ah Lord Yahweh ! they say of me , Isn 't he a speaker of parables ?
and tell the land of Israel , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
cry and wail , son of man ; for it is on my people , it is on all the princes of Israel : they are delivered over to the sword with my people ; strike therefore on your thigh .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight , who have sworn oaths to them ; but he brings iniquity to memory , that they may be taken .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : remove the turban , and take off the crown ; this [ shall be ] no more the same ; exalt that which is low , and abase that which is high .
I will overturn , overturn , overturn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall be for fuel to the fire ; your blood shall be in the midst of the land ; you shall be remembered no more : for I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
you shall say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to defile her !
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will scatter you among the nations , and disperse you through the countries ; and I will consume your filthiness out of you .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Yahweh , have poured out my wrath on you .
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in its midst , like a roaring lion ravening the prey : they have devoured souls ; they take treasure and precious things ; they have made her widows many in its midst .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
their names were Oholah the elder , and Oholibah her sister : and they became mine , and they bore sons and daughters . as for their names , Samaria is Oholah , and Jerusalem Oholibah .
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
her sister Oholibah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her prostitution , remembering the days of her youth , in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , [ and ] all the Assyrians with them ; desirable young men , governors and rulers all of them , princes and men of renown , all of them riding on horses .
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
for they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their idols have they committed adultery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they bore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be devoured .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decorate yourself with ornaments ,
they went in to her , as they go in to a prostitute : so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
Righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and also a pile [ of wood ] for the bones under [ the caldron ] ; make it boil well ; yes , let its bones be boiled in its midst .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : Woe to the bloody city , to the caldron whose rust is therein , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
heap on the wood , make the fire hot , boil well the flesh , and make thick the broth , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mourn nor weep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your headdress on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don 't cover your lips , and don 't eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
your tires shall be on your heads , and your shoes on your feet : you shall not mourn nor weep ; but you shall pine away in your iniquities , and moan one toward another .
in that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped , and you shall speak , and be no more mute : so you will be a sign to them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their encampments in you , and make their dwellings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have clapped your hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Ammon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and revenged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , I will stretch out my hand on Edom , and will cut off man and animal from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; even to Dedan shall they fall by the sword .
I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath ; and they shall know my vengeance , says the Lord Yahweh .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I am against you , Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and a company , and many people .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make forts against you , and cast up a mound against you , and raise up the buckler against you .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
I will cause the noise of your songs to cease ; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre : shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded groan , when the slaughter is made in the midst of you ?
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay aside their robes , and strip off their embroidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tremble every moment , and be astonished at you .
now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your departure .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall make you a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
and tell Tyre , you who dwell at the entry of the sea , who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Yahweh : you , Tyre , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars ; they have made your benches of Ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the islands of Kittim .
of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning .
the inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers : your wise men , Tyre , were in you , they were your pilots .
the old men of Gebal and the wise men of it were in you your repairers of ship seams : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise .
the men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around , and valorous men were in your towers ; they hanged their shields on your walls all around ; they have perfected your beauty .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith , and confections , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
these were your traffickers in choice wares , in wrappings of blue and embroidered work , and in chests of rich clothing , bound with cords and made of cedar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise : and you were replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bald for you , and clothe them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you , and lament over you , [ saying ] , Who is there like Tyre , like her who is brought to silence in the midst of the sea ?
when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters , your merchandise and all your company fell in your midst .
by your great wisdom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your riches , and your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you were the anointed cherub who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the holy mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until unrighteousness was found in you .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
for I will send pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
there shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel , nor a hurting Thorn of any that are around them , that scorned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob .
they shall dwell securely therein ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant vineyards , and shall dwell securely , when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh their God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
I will put hooks in your jaws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
I 'll cast you forth into the wilderness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won 't be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
therefore , behold , I am against you , and against your rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation , from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia .
I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years ; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries . "
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall carry off her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
for the day is near , even the day of Yahweh is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
a sword shall come on Egypt , and anguish shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Put , and Lud , and all the mixed people , and Cub , and the children of the land that is allied with them , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus says Yahweh : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
I will make the rivers dry , and will sell the land into the hand of evil men ; and I will make the land desolate , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I , Yahweh , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis ; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great anguish , and No shall be broken up ; and Memphis [ shall have ] adversaries in the daytime .
at Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ month ] , in the seventh [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and behold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ healing ] medicines , to put a bandage to bind it , that it be strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @-@ like shade , and of high stature ; and its top was among the thick boughs .
the waters nourished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plantation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh : because you are exalted in stature , and he has set his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
Strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land ; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
on his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of you .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of animals trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
it happened also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
they shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him : they are gone down , they lie still , even the uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all their multitude ; their graves are around them ; all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army , slain by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
for I have put his terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised , with those who are slain by the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the sword on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watchman ;
then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet , and doesn 't take warning , if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and didn 't take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
when I tell the wicked , O wicked man , you shall surely die , and you don 't speak to warn the wicked from his way ; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity , but his blood will I require at your hand .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
when I tell the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to his righteousness , and commit iniquity , none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered ; but in his iniquity that he has committed , therein shall he die .
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , committing no iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him : he has done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
it happened in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
son of man , they who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance .
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yahweh , when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment , because of all their abominations which they have committed .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don 't do them .
you eat the fat , and you clothe yourself with the wool , you kill the fatlings ; but you don 't feed the sheep .
you haven 't strengthened the diseased , neither have you healed that which was sick , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with rigor you have ruled over them .
they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth ; and there was none who searched or sought .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , surely because my sheep became a prey , and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my sheep , but the shepherds fed themselves , and didn 't feed my sheep ;
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I myself , even I , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the watercourses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good pasture ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but the fat and the strong I will destroy ; I will feed them in justice .
does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture , but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture ? and to have drunk of the clear waters , but you must foul the residue with your feet ?
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
and tell it , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I am against you , Mount Seir , and I will stretch out my hand against you , and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not hated blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its slain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall who are slain with the sword .
you shall know that I , Yahweh , have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they have been given us to devour .
you have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I have sworn , [ saying ] , surely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be tilled and sown ;
and I will multiply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
yes , I will cause men to walk on you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess you , and you shall be their inheritance , and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of children .
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I don 't do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have profaned among the nations , where you went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
I will put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and you shall keep my ordinances , and do them .
you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your uncleanness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Yahweh , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was desolate : I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and I will do it .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : for this , moreover , will I be inquired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them : I will increase them with men like a flock .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sinews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , an earthquake ; and the bones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , behold , there were sinews on them , and flesh came up , and skin covered them above ; but there was no breath in them .
therefore prophesy , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
you , son of man , take one stick , and write on it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick , and write on it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and [ for ] all the house of Israel his companions :
say to them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ;
my servant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my ordinances , and observe my statutes , and do them .
they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant , in which your fathers lived ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children , forever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a Covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting Covenant with them ; and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore .
you shall ascend , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cloud to cover the land , you , and all your hordes , and many peoples with you .
you shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them riding on horses , a great company and a mighty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hordes , and on the many peoples who are with him , an overflowing shower , and great hailstones , fire , and sulfur .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hordes , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be devoured .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall plunder those who plundered them , and rob those who robbed them , says the Lord Yahweh .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
I will set my glory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity ; because they trespassed against me , and I hid my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries , and they fell all of them by the sword .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them ; and I hid my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Jealous for my holy name .
they shall bear their shame , and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
they shall know that I am Yahweh their God , in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
every lodge was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one Reed .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
the windows of it , and its arches , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arches were before them .
there was a gate to the inner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arches were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the porch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok , who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him .
then he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cubits .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
the thresholds , and the closed windows , and the galleries around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ceilings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the inner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the altar was of wood , three cubits high , and its length two cubits ; and its corners , and its length , and its walls , were of wood : and he said to me , This is the table that is before Yahweh .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
over against the twenty [ cubits ] which belonged to the inner court , and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court , was gallery against gallery in the third story .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their doorpost beside my doorpost , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed : therefore I have consumed them in my anger .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits , and the breadth a cubit .
the ledge shall be fourteen [ cubits ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and its bottom shall be a cubit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
he said to me , Son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh : these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleanse it and make Atonement for it .
you shall also take the bull of the sin offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanctuary .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Yahweh .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
Yahweh said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
as for the prince , he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
in that you have brought in foreigners , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to profane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my Covenant , [ to add ] to all your abominations .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , No foreigner , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
because they ministered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yahweh , and they shall bear their iniquity .
they shall not come near to me , to execute the office of priest to me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , to the things that are most holy ; but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
they shall have linen tires on their heads , and shall have linen breeches on their waists ; they shall not clothe themselves with [ anything that causes ] sweat .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who is the widow of a priest .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister who has had no husband , they may defile themselves .
in the day that he goes into the sanctuary , into the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yahweh .
the first of all the first fruits of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offerings , shall be for the priest : you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough , to cause a blessing to rest on your house .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , you shall offer an offering to Yahweh , a holy portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @-@ five thousand [ reeds ] , and the breadth shall be ten thousand : it shall be holy in all its border all around .
of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in breadth ] , square all around ; and fifty cubits for its suburbs all around .
it is a holy portion of the land ; it shall be for the priests , the ministers of the sanctuary , who come near to minister to Yahweh ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @-@ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of barley ;
and the set portion of oil , of the bath of oil , the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , [ which is ] ten baths , even a Homer ; ( for ten baths are a Homer ; )
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the posts of the gate of the inner court .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who errs , and for him who is simple : so you shall make Atonement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh , seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a male goat daily for a sin offering .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fifteenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : the gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
and he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for the bull , and an ephah for the ram , and for the lambs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the prince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward , and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the knees . again he measured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the waist .
afterward he measured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed through .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] portions .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath . this is the west side .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
those who labor in the city , out of all the tribes of Israel , shall cultivate it .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
the prince of the eunuchs gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , [ of ] Shadrach ; and to Mishael , [ of ] Meshach ; and to Azariah , [ of ] Abednego .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
in every matter of wisdom and understanding , concerning which the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
he changes the times and the seasons ; he removes kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
therefore Daniel went in to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon ; he went and said thus to him : Don 't destroy the wise men of Babylon ; bring me in before the king , and I will show to the king the interpretation .
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus to him , I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah , who will make known to the king the interpretation .
Daniel answered before the king , and said , The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men , enchanters , magicians , nor soothsayers , show to the king ;
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen hereafter ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
you , O king , saw , and behold , a great image . this image , which was mighty , and whose brightness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was awesome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory ;
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things ; and as iron that crushes all these , shall it break in pieces and crush .
whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men ; but they shall not cling to one another , even as iron does not mingle with clay .
the king answered to Daniel , and said , Of a truth your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was sixty cubits , and its breadth six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
that whenever you hear the sound of the Horn , flute , zither , Lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up ;
and whoever doesn 't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the Horn , flute , zither , Lyre , harp , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
but if not , be it known to you , O king , that we will not serve your gods , nor worship the golden image which you have set up .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its height reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the earth .
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all flesh was fed from it .
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed , and behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky .
nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached to the sky , and its sight to all the earth ;
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree ; your kingdom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Are you that Daniel , who are of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
Peres ; your kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , doesn 't respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste to the den of lions .
my God has sent his angel , and has shut the lions ' mouths , and they have not hurt me ; because as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before you , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
I make a decree , that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and steadfast forever , His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his dominion shall be even to the end .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I saw until its wings were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made to stand on two feet as a man ; and a man 's heart was given to it .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a Leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
I saw until thrones were placed , and one who was ancient of days sat : his clothing was white as snow , and the hair of his head like pure wool ; his throne was fiery flames , [ and ] its wheels burning fire .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the citadel of Susa , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river Ulai .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great Horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the glorious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and trampled on them .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was frightened , and fell on my face : but he said to me , understand , son of man ; for the vision belongs to the time of the end .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me upright .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
the rough male goat is the king of Greece : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
I , Daniel , fainted , and was sick certain days ; then I rose up , and did the king 's business : and I wondered at the vision , but none understood it .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances ;
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God , that we should turn from our iniquities , and have discernment in your truth .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his petitions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
my God , turn your ear , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our desolations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness , but for your great mercies ' sake .
while I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
he instructed me , and talked with me , and said , Daniel , I am now come forth to give you wisdom and understanding .
in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and behold , a man clothed in linen , whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
then he said , " Do you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia . when I go forth , behold , the prince of Greece shall come .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail .
also their gods , with their molten images , [ and ] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the king of the south shall be moved with anger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multitude , and the multitude shall be given into his hand .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much substance .
in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the children of the violent among your people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but he who comes against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him ; and he shall stand in the glorious land , and in his hand shall be destruction .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him , and shall be broken ; yes , also the prince of the Covenant .
after the treaty made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
for ships of Kittim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be grieved , and shall return , and have indignation against the holy Covenant , and shall do [ his pleasure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who forsake the holy Covenant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses ; and a god whom his fathers didn 't know shall he honor with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse ; and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
the word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea , which can 't be measured nor numbered ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of Jezreel .
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the grain , the new wine , and the oil , and multiplied to her silver and gold , which they used for Baal .
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees , about which she has said , ' These are my wages that my lovers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , ' and the animals of the field shall eat them .
I will visit on her the days of the Baals , to which she burned incense , when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , " says Yahweh .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
I will sow her to me in the earth ; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
you will stumble in the day , and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the prostitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh .
my people consult with their wooden idol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray , and they have been unfaithful to their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute , nor your brides when they commit adultery ; because the men consort with prostitutes , and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes ; so the people without understanding will come to ruin .
the wind has wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
they will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh ; but they won 't find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke . among the tribes of Israel , I have made known that which will surely be .
" when Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah his wound , Then Ephraim went to Assyria , and sent to king Jareb : but he is not able to heal you , neither will he cure you of your wound .
for I will be to Ephraim like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Judah . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
" come , and let us return to Yahweh ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will heal us ; he has injured us , and he will bind up our wounds .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets ; I killed them with the words of my mouth . your judgments are like a flash of lightning .
when I would heal Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , also the wickedness of Samaria ; for they commit falsehood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of robbers ravages outside .
they don 't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness . now their own deeds have engulfed them . they are before my face .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the Baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their Congregation has heard .
they haven 't cried to me with their heart , but they howl on their beds . they assemble themselves for grain and new wine . they turn away from me .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I didn 't approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
for they sow the wind , and they will reap the whirlwind . he has no standing grain . the stalk will yield no head . if it does yield , strangers will swallow it up .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
what will you do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yahweh ?
for , behold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . Memphis will bury them . Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver . thorns will be in their tents .
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah . he will remember their iniquity . he will punish them for their sins .
though they bring up their children , yet I will bereave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , woe also to them when I depart from them !
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit . according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars . as their land has prospered , they have adorned their sacred stones .
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
I drew them with cords of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks ; and I bent down to him and I fed him .
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger . I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of you ; and I will not come in wrath .
they will walk after Yahweh , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children will come trembling from the west .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
I have also spoken to the prophets , and I have multiplied visions ; and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor , and like the smoke out of the chimney .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted . therefore they have forgotten me .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
the sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him . he is an unwise son ; for when it is time , he doesn 't come to the opening of the womb .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
Assyria can 't save us . we won 't ride on horses ; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ' Our gods ! ' for in you the fatherless finds mercy . "
Ephraim , what have I to do any more with idols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green fir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is prudent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Yahweh are right , and the righteous walk in them ; But the rebellious stumble in them .
what the swarming locust has left , the great locust has eaten . what the great locust has left , the grasshopper has eaten . what the grasshopper has left , the caterpillar has eaten .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
the vine has dried up , and the fig tree withered ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all of the trees of the field are withered ; for joy has withered away from the sons of men .
Sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , for the day of Yahweh comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they run like mighty men . they climb the wall like warriors . they each march in his line , and they don 't swerve off course .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
tear your heart , and not your garments , and turn to Yahweh , your God ; for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , and relents from sending calamity .
gather the people . Sanctify the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bridegroom go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
Yahweh answered his people , " behold , I will send you grain , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
Don 't be afraid , you animals of the field ; for the pastures of the wilderness spring up , for the tree bears its fruit . the fig tree and the vine yield their strength .
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten , the great locust , the grasshopper , and the caterpillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen afterward , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . your old men will dream dreams . your young men will see visions .
" for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem ,
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat ; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
" yes , and what are you to me , Tyre , and Sidon , and all the regions of Philistia ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head .
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah , and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a faraway nation , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
Yahweh will roar from Zion , and Thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
it will happen in that day , that the mountains will drop down sweet wine , the hills will flow with milk , all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters , and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh , and will water the valley of Shittim .
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
he said : " Yahweh will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn , and the top of Carmel will wither . "
I will break the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven , and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden ; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir , " says Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon ; and I will turn my hand against Ekron ; and the remnant of the Philistines will perish , " says the Lord Yahweh .
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly Covenant ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of the children of Ammon , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead , that they may enlarge their border .
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it will devour its palaces , with shouting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the whirlwind ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Moab , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime ;
but I will send a fire on Moab , and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth ; and Moab will die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Judah , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have rejected Yahweh 's law , and have not kept his statutes , and their lies have led them astray , after which their fathers walked ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
yet I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Nazirites . Isn 't this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yahweh .
flight will perish from the swift ; and the strong won 't strengthen his force ; neither shall the mighty deliver himself ;
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you , children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt , saying :
will a lion roar in the thicket , when he has no prey ? does a young lion cry out of his den , if he has caught nothing ?
can a bird fall in a trap on the earth , where no snare is set for him ? does a snare spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
does the trumpet alarm sound in a city , without the people being afraid ? does evil happen to a city , and Yahweh hasn 't done it ?
proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , " assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria , and see what unrest is in her , and what oppression is among them . "
" for in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone straight before her ; and you will cast yourselves into Harmon , " says Yahweh .
" I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards ; and your fig trees and your olive trees have the swarming locust devoured : yet you haven 't returned to me , " says Yahweh .
" the virgin of Israel has fallen ; She shall rise no more . she is cast down on her land ; there is no one to raise her up . "
seek Yahweh , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it devour , and there be no one to quench it in Bethel .
seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion , and turns the shadow of death into the morning , and makes the day dark with night ; who calls for the waters of the sea , and pours them out on the surface of the earth , Yahweh is his name ,
Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor , and take taxes from him of wheat : you have built houses of cut stone , but you will not dwell in them . you have planted pleasant vineyards , but you shall not drink their wine .
for I know how many your offenses , and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the needy in the courts .
therefore thus says Yahweh , the God of Armies , the Lord : " wailing will be in all the broad ways ; and they will say in all the streets , ' Alas ! Alas ! ' and they will call the farmer to mourning , and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing .
as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a snake bit him .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .
take away from me the noise of your songs ! I will not listen to the music of your harps .
Woe to those who are at ease in Zion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria , the notable men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
go to Calneh , and see ; and from there go to Hamath the great ; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. are they better than these kingdoms ? or is their border greater than your border ?
who lie on beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
who drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the best oils ; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
" for , behold , Yahweh commands , and the great house will be smashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .

behold , the days come , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Yahweh .
they will wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh , and will not find it .
though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the serpent , and it will bite them .
though they go into captivity before their enemies , there I will command the sword , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for evil , and not for good .
for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , is he who touches the land and it melts , and all who dwell in it will mourn ; and it will rise up wholly like the River , and will sink again , like the River of Egypt .
it is he who builds his rooms in the heavens , and has founded his vault on the earth ; he who calls for the waters of the sea , and pours them out on the surface of the earth ; Yahweh is his name .
are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me , children of Israel ? " says Yahweh . " haven 't I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?

in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
I will bring my people Israel back from captivity , and they will rebuild the ruined cities , and inhabit them ; and they will plant vineyards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gardens , and eat their fruit .
I will plant them on their land , and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them , " says Yahweh your God .
the pride of your heart has deceived you , you who dwell in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high , who says in his heart , ' Who will bring me down to the ground ? '

but don 't look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don 't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction . Don 't speak proudly in the day of distress .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .

but Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stormy .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not , for the sea grew more and more stormy against them .
for you threw me into the depths , in the heart of the seas . the flood was all around me . all your waves and your billows passed over me .
the people of Nineveh believed God ; and they proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from their greatest even to their least .
the news reached the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and took off his royal robe , covered himself with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way . God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them , and he didn 't do it .
therefore now , Yahweh , take , I beg you , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . "
then Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .

the word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
for , behold , Yahweh comes forth out of his place , and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth .
" all this is for the disobedience of Jacob , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the disobedience of Jacob ? Isn 't it Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? Aren 't they Jerusalem ?
all her idols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them , and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return . "
Don 't tell it in Gath . Don 't weep at all . at Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust .
harness the chariot to the swift steed , inhabitant of Lachish . she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion ; For the transgressions of Israel were found in you .

Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they covet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
you drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children you take away my blessing forever .
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yahweh at their head .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray ; for those who feed their teeth , they proclaim , " Peace ! " and whoever doesn 't provide for their mouths , they prepare war against him :
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not divine ; and the sun will go down on the prophets , and the day will be black over them .
the seers shall be disappointed , and the diviners confounded . yes , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer from God . "
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jacob his disobedience , and to Israel his sin .
please listen to this , you heads of the house of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel , who abhor justice , and pervert all equity .
therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble , and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh 's temple will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be exalted above the hills ; and peoples will stream to it .
and he will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations afar off . they will beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . nation will not lift up sword against nation , neither will they learn war any more .
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken .
indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods ; but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever .
" in that day , " says Yahweh , " I will assemble that which is lame , and I will gather that which is driven away , and that which I have afflicted ;
and I will make that which was lame a remnant , and that which was cast far off a strong nation : and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on , even forever . "
you , tower of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Zion , to you it will come , yes , the former dominion will come , the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem .
now you shall gather yourself in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh , in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
he will be our peace when Assyria invades our land , and when he marches through our fortresses , then we will raise against him seven shepherds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in its gates . he will deliver us from the Assyrian , when he invades our land , and when he marches within our border .
the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples , like dew from Yahweh , like showers on the grass , that don 't wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
" it will happen in that day , " says Yahweh , " That I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you , and will destroy your chariots .
I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst ; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands .
listen now to what Yahweh says : " arise , plead your case before the mountains , and let the hills hear what you have to say .
hear , you mountains , Yahweh 's controversy , and you enduring foundations of the earth ; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people , and he will contend with Israel .
therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound . I have made you desolate because of your sins .
you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your humiliation will be in your midst . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the sword .
you will sow , but won 't reap . you will tread the olives , but won 't anoint yourself with oil ; and crush grapes , but won 't drink the wine .
the godly man has perished out of the earth , and there is no one upright among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hunts his brother with a net .
the best of them is like a brier . the most upright is worse than a Thorn hedge . the day of your watchmen , even your visitation , has come ; now is the time of their confusion .
Don 't trust in a neighbor . Don 't put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your embrace , be careful of the words of your mouth !
for the son dishonors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
but as for me , I will look to Yahweh . I will wait for the God of my salvation . my God will hear me .
Don 't rejoice against me , my enemy . when I fall , I will arise . when I sit in darkness , Yahweh will be a light to me .
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh , because I have sinned against him , until he pleads my case , and executes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righteousness .
in that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and mountain to mountain .
" as in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt , I will show them marvelous things . "
the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .

he will again have compassion on us . he will tread our iniquities under foot ; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
Yahweh is slow to anger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished . Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
he rebukes the sea , and makes it dry , and dries up all the rivers . Bashan languishes , and Carmel ; and the flower of Lebanon languishes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trembles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierceness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
but with an overflowing flood , he will make a full end of her place , and will pursue his enemies into darkness .
thus says Yahweh : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will afflict you no more .

where is the den of the lions , and the feeding place of the young lions , where the lion and the lioness walked , the lion 's cubs , and no one made them afraid ?
the lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
the Horseman mounting , and the flashing sword , the glittering spear , and a multitude of slain , and a great heap of corpses , and there is no end of the bodies . they stumble on their bodies ,
" behold , I am against you , " says Yahweh of Armies , " and I will lift your skirts over your face . I will show the nations your nakedness , and the kingdoms your shame .
it will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you , and say , ' Nineveh is laid waste ! who will mourn for her ? ' where will I seek comforters for you ? "
are you better than No @-@ Amon , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
yet was she carried away . she went into captivity . her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her honorable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
all your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first @-@ ripe figs : if they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the eater .
your guards are like the locusts , and your officials like the swarms of locusts , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun appears , they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
there is no healing your wound , for your injury is fatal . all who hear the report of you clap their hands over you ; for who hasn 't felt your endless cruelty ?
" look among the nations , watch , and wonder marvelously ; for I am working a work in your days , which you will not believe though it is told you .
for , behold , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , that march through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .

yes , he scoffs at kings , and princes are a derision to him . he laughs at every stronghold , for he builds up an earthen ramp , and takes it .
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and gathers them in his dragnet . therefore he rejoices and is glad .
therefore he sacrifices to his net , and burns incense to his dragnet , because by them his life is luxurious , and his food is good .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .
yes , moreover , wine is treacherous . a haughty man who doesn 't stay at home , who enlarges his desire as Sheol , and he is like death , and can 't be satisfied , but gathers to himself all nations , and heaps to himself all peoples .
because you have plundered many nations , all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you , because of men 's blood , and for the violence done to the land , to the city and to all who dwell in it .
Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
for the stone will cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it .

the sun and moon stood still in the sky , at the light of your arrows as they went , at the shining of your glittering spear .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your anointed . you crushed the head of the land of wickedness . you stripped them head to foot . Selah .
you pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears . they came as a whirlwind to scatter me , gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret .
the word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah , the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah , the son of Amon , king of Judah .
I will sweep away man and animal . I will sweep away the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and the heaps of rubble with the wicked . I will cut off man from the surface of the earth , says Yahweh .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh , for the day of Yahweh is at hand . for Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice . he has consecrated his guests .
their wealth will become a spoil , and their houses a desolation . yes , they will build houses , but won 't inhabit them . they will plant vineyards , but won 't drink their wine .
seek Yahweh , all you humble of the land , who have kept his ordinances . seek righteousness . seek humility . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh 's anger .
Yahweh will be awesome to them , for he will famish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
she didn 't obey the voice . she didn 't receive correction . she didn 't trust in Yahweh . she didn 't draw near to her God .
in that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings , in which you have transgressed against me ; for then I will take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones , and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain .
but I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people , and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh .
the remnant of Israel will not do iniquity , nor speak lies , neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "

in that day , it will be said to Jerusalem , " Don 't be afraid , Zion . Don 't let your hands be weak . "
Yahweh , your God , is in the midst of you , a mighty one who will save . he will rejoice over you with joy . he will calm you in his love . he will rejoice over you with singing .

again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , four chariots came out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
the one with the black horses goes out toward the north country ; and the white went out after them ; and the dappled went forth toward the south country . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth : and he said , " Go around and through the earth ! " so they walked back and forth through the earth .

an oracle . the word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach , and will rest upon Damascus ; for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh ;
Ashkelon will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will writhe in agony ; as will Ekron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
I will encamp around my house against the army , that none pass through or return ; and no oppressor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .

" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Judah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Yahweh , " I will strike every horse with terror , and his Rider with madness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah , and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness .
in that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is feeble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Yahweh before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
it will come to pass in that day , says Yahweh of Armies , that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they will be remembered no more . I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land .
it will happen in that day , that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision , when he prophesies ; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive :
but he will say , ' I am no prophet , I am a tiller of the ground ; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yahweh , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
it will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh ; not day , and not night ; but it will come to pass , that at evening time there will be light .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
this will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem : their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet , and their eyes will consume away in their sockets , and their tongue will consume away in their mouth .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don 't go up to keep the feast of tents .
" but you profane it , in that you say , ' Yahweh 's table is polluted , and its fruit , even its food , is contemptible . '
behold , I will rebuke your seed , and will spread Dung on your faces , even the Dung of your feasts ; and you will be taken away with it .
" my Covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me ; and he was reverent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
Judah has dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
Yahweh will cut off , to the man who does this , him who wakes and him who answers , out of the tents of Jacob , and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies .
yet you say , ' Why ? ' because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth , against whom you have dealt treacherously , though she is your companion , and the wife of your Covenant .
" behold , I send my messenger , and he will prepare the way before me ; and the Lord , whom you seek , will suddenly come to his temple ; and the messenger of the Covenant , whom you desire , behold , he comes ! " says Yahweh of Armies .
and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver , and he will purify the sons of Levi , and refine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness .
I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yahweh of Armies .
then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another ; and Yahweh listened , and heard , and a book of memory was written before him , for those who feared Yahweh , and who honored his name .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
Jesse became the father of King David . David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
" behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . they shall call his name Immanuel " ; which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
'You Bethlehem , land of Judah , are in no way least among the princes of Judah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , " Go and search diligently for the young child . when you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and worshiped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
his winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor . he will gather his wheat into the barn , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . "
Jesus , when he was baptized , went up directly from the water : and behold , the heavens were opened to him . he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming on him .
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has dawned . "
walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . he called them .
the report about him went out into all Syria . they brought to him all who were sick , afflicted with various diseases and torments , possessed with demons , epileptics , and paralytics ; and he healed them .
seeing the multitudes , he went up onto the mountain . when he had sat down , his disciples came to him .
" you are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost its flavor , with what will it be salted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men .
neither do you light a lamp , and put it under a measuring basket , but on a stand ; and it shines to all who are in the house .
for most certainly , I tell you , until heaven and earth pass away , not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law , until all things are accomplished .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your adversary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
if your right eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna .
but let your ' Yes ' be ' Yes ' and your ' No ' be ' No . ' whatever is more than these is of the evil one .
" you have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
but you , when you pray , enter into your inner room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
" moreover when you fast , don 't be like the hypocrites , with sad faces . for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fasting . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
but if your eye is evil , your whole body will be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
but if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , won 't he much more clothe you , you of little faith ?
" therefore don 't be anxious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clothed ? '
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the speck that is in your brother 's eye , but don 't consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
or how will you tell your brother , ' Let me remove the speck from your eye ; ' and behold , the beam is in your own eye ?
" Don 't give that which is holy to the dogs , neither throw your pearls before the pigs , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
" enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat on that house ; and it didn 't fall , for it was founded on the rock .
everyone who hears these words of mine , and doesn 't do them will be like a foolish man , who built his house on the sand .
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebuked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , two people possessed by demons met him there , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
those who fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were possessed with demons .
behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , " Son , cheer up ! your sins are forgiven you . "
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... " ( then he said to the paralytic ) , " Get up , and take up your Mat , and go up to your house . "
when Jesus heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physician , but those who are sick do .
Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were harassed and scattered , like sheep without a shepherd .
whoever doesn 't receive you , nor hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake off the dust from your feet .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you .
but when they deliver you up , don 't be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
it is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant like his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more those of his household !
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
Don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
" Don 't think that I came to send peace on the earth . I didn 't come to send peace , but a sword .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
but I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , on the day of judgment , than for you . "
all things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows the Son , except the Father ; neither does anyone know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him .
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , " behold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
he said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one sheep , and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day , won 't he grab on to it , and lift it out ?
then one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , was brought to him and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
you offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
for whoever has , to him will be given , and he will have abundance , but whoever doesn 't have , from him will be taken away even that which he has .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for this people 's heart has grown callous , their ears are dull of hearing , they have closed their eyes ; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their heart , and should turn again ; and I would heal them . '
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
when anyone hears the word of the Kingdom , and doesn 't understand it , the evil one comes , and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart . this is what was sown by the roadside .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
what was sown on the good ground , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , who most certainly bears fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty . "
let both grow together until the harvest , and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers , " First , gather up the darnel weeds , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn . " ' "
which indeed is smaller than all seeds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . "
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one .
as therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire ; so will it be at the end of this age .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hid . in his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and buys that field .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
the king was grieved , but for the sake of his oaths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he commanded it to be given ,
when evening had come , his disciples came to him , saying , " This place is deserted , and the hour is already late . send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass ; and he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , broke and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples gave to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pray . when evening had come , he was there alone .
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
for God commanded , ' honor your father and your mother , ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
you hypocrites ! well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
that which enters into the mouth doesn 't defile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
in the morning , ' It will be foul weather today , for the sky is red and threatening . ' hypocrites ! you know how to discern the appearance of the sky , but you can 't discern the signs of the times !
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , " Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
but he turned , and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! you are a stumbling block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of men . "
for the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds .
while he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them . behold , a voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . listen to him . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don 't tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea .
if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire .
if your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred sheep , and one of them goes astray , doesn 't he leave the ninety @-@ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone astray ?
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
again , assuredly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven .
but because he couldn 't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
" but that servant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred denarii , and he grabbed him , and took him by the throat , saying , ' Pay me what you owe ! '
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
it happened when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
for there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother 's womb , and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven 's sake . he who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
again I tell you , it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
everyone who has left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , will receive one hundred times , and will inherit eternal life .
" for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
" they said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the vineyard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
but Jesus answered , " You don 't know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? " they said to him , " We are able . "
the multitudes who went before him , and who followed kept shouting , " Hosanna to the son of David ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
Jesus entered into the temple of God , and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the money changers ' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves .
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children who were crying in the temple and saying , " Hosanna to the son of David ! " they were indignant ,
for John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you didn 't believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . when you saw it , you didn 't even repent afterward , that you might believe him .
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and seize his inheritance . '
Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them , saying ,
those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together as many as they found , both bad and good . the wedding was filled with guests .
'i am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
for they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
therefore behold , I send to you prophets , wise men , and scribes . some of them you will kill and crucify ; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city ;
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there will be famines , plagues , and earthquakes in various places .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory .
he will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thirsty , and you gave me drink . I was a stranger , and you took me in .
I was naked , and you clothed me . I was sick , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' depart from me , you Cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father 's Kingdom . "
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
while he was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs , from the chief priest and elders of the people .
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , " Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me .
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists , and some slapped him ,
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor .

now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick , and those who were possessed by demons .
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the Mat that the paralytic was lying on .

how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "

and it happened , as he sowed , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and devoured it .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
for whoever has , to him will more be given , and he who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
and crying out with a loud voice , he said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , you Son of the Most High God ? I adjure you by God , don 't torment me . "

they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legion ; and they were afraid .

but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and those sitting with him . the king said to the young lady , " Ask me whatever you want , and I will give it to you . "
the king was exceedingly sorry , but for the sake of his oaths , and of his dinner guests , he didn 't wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring John 's head , and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
the Apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .

he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marveled ;
now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , they found fault .
( for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , don 't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms , holding to the tradition of the elders .
they don 't eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they bathe themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : washings of cups , pitchers , bronze vessels , and couches . )
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
for Moses said , ' honor your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '

he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for he was teaching his disciples , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
he sat down , and called the twelve ; and he said to them , " If any man wants to be first , he shall be last of all , and servant of all . "

if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
for everyone will be salted with fire , and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt .
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .

" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception , and kill him .

how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
it also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught . there was a man there , and his right hand was withered .

Jesus said , " Who touched me ? " when all denied it , Peter and those with him said , " Master , the multitudes press and jostle you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "

saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .

while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they didn 't understand this saying . it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
but he turned and rebuked them , " You don 't know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
turning to the disciples , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him . "
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them . "
in the same way a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an Inn , and took care of him .
on the next day , when he departed , he took out two denarii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' Take care of him . whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '
he said to them , " When you pray , say , ' Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy . May your Kingdom come . May your will be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep knocking , and it will be opened to you .
" which of you fathers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won 't give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice , and said to him , " blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts which nursed you ! "
the lamp of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is evil , your body also is full of darkness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don 't know it . "
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
meanwhile , when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together , so much so that they trampled on each other , he began to tell his disciples first of all , " beware of the yeast of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
" I tell you , my friends , don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
sell that which you have , and give gifts to the needy . make for yourselves purses which don 't grow old , a treasure in the heavens that doesn 't fail , where no thief approaches , neither moth destroys .
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
but he who didn 't know , and did things worthy of stripes , will be beaten with few stripes . to whomever much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entrusted , of him more will be asked .
they will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother @-@ in @-@ law against her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , and daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law . "
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and put in his own garden . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches . "
they will come from the east , west , north , and south , and will sit down in the Kingdom of God .
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
whoever doesn 't bear his own cross , and come after me , can 't be my disciple .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ' rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . '
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight .
" he arose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
he cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! for I am in anguish in this flame . '
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
but who is there among you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
he said to the disciples , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
as it happened in the days of Noah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
you know the commandments : ' Don 't commit adultery , ' ' Don 't murder , ' ' Don 't steal , ' ' Don 't give false testimony , ' ' honor your father and your mother . ' "
for it is easier for a Camel to enter in through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
" it happened when he had come back again , having received the kingdom , that he commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
then why didn 't you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
for the days will come on you , when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , surround you , hem you in on every side ,
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
it happened on one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News , that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders .
he answered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
but that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
he said , " Watch out that you don 't get led astray , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' therefore don 't follow them .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
when they are already budding , you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near .
every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet .
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
for who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Isn 't it he who sits at the table ? but I am in the midst of you as one who serves .
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard , and had sat down together , Peter sat among them .
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
when he found out that he was in Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem during those days .
now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
for behold , the days are coming in which they will say , ' blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed . '
when they came to the place that is called The skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , from Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has declared him .
I didn 't recognize him , but he who sent me to baptize in water , he said to me , ' On whomever you will see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit . '
Jesus turned , and saw them following , and said to them , " What are you looking for ? " they said to him , " Rabbi " ( which is to say , being interpreted , Teacher ) , " where are you staying ? "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
after this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and they stayed there a few days .
he made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this , and they believed the Scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in his name , observing his signs which he did .
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
that which is born of the flesh is flesh . that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
the wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don 't know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don 't receive our witness .
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
he who believes in him is not judged . he who doesn 't believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
he who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice . this , my joy , therefore is made full .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again ; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life . "
you worship that which you don 't know . we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews .
the woman said to him , " I know that Messiah comes , " ( he who is called Christ ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
so when he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Your child lives ! "
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate , there is a pool , which is called in Hebrew , " Bethesda , " having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of those who were sick , blind , lame , or paralyzed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sabbath .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn 't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
Don 't marvel at this , for the hour comes , in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice ,
and will come out ; those who have done good , to the resurrection of life ; and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don 't seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
but the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
after these things , Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
Jesus took the loaves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
on the next day , the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one in which his disciples had embarked , and that Jesus hadn 't entered with his disciples into the boat , but his disciples had gone away alone .
when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn 't there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it wasn 't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
all those whom the Father gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
this is the will of my Father who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
I am the living bread which came down out of heaven . if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don 't have life in yourselves .
as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he who feeds on me , he will also live because of me .
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
but there are some of you who don 't believe . " for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn 't believe , and who it was who would betray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my Father . "
now the feast of the Jews , the Feast of booths , was at hand .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
but of the multitude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Christ comes , he won 't do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
what is this word that he said , ' You will seek me , and won 't find me ; and where I am , you can 't come ' ? "
but he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn 't yet glorified .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
again , therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . he who follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . "
Jesus said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sins . where I go , you can 't come . "
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I haven 't come of myself , but he sent me .
you have not known him , but I know him . if I said , ' I don 't know him , ' I would be like you , a liar . but I know him , and keep his word .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
when he had said this , he spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , anointed the blind man 's eyes with the mud ,
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
but how he now sees , we don 't know ; or who opened his eyes , we don 't know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
we know that God has spoken to Moses . but as for this man , we don 't know where he comes from . "
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who doesn 't enter by the door into the sheep fold , but climbs up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who doesn 't own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and flees . the wolf snatches the sheep , and scatters them .
I have other sheep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one shepherd .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
he said these things , and after that , he said to them , " Our friend , Lazarus , has fallen asleep , but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep . "
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secretly , saying , " The Teacher is here , and is calling you . "
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days . "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temple , " What do you think--that he isn 't coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might seize him .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
Mary , therefore , took a pound of ointment of pure Nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
they took the branches of the palm trees , and went out to meet him , and cried out , " Hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel ! "
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
most certainly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
Jesus therefore said to them , " Yet a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that darkness doesn 't overtake you . he who walks in the darkness doesn 't know where he is going .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
I don 't speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . '
Jesus therefore answered , " It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it . " so when he had dipped the piece of bread , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going , you can 't come , ' so now I tell you .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
Don 't you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
but the counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and will remind you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
you heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' if you loved me , you would have rejoiced , because I said ' I am going to my Father ; ' for the Father is greater than I.
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can 't bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the vine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn 't know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a servant is not greater than his lord . ' if they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don 't know him who sent me .
if I hadn 't done among them the works which no one else did , they wouldn 't have had sin . but now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father .
" when the counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don 't go away , the counselor won 't come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
however when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he hears , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won 't see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
a woman , when she gives birth , has sorrow , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she doesn 't remember the anguish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
I came out from the Father , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . "
behold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be scattered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yours , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
when therefore he said to them , " I am he , " they went backward , and fell to the ground .
Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
Jesus therefore said to Peter , " Put the sword into its sheath . the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not surely drink it ? "
and led him to Annas first , for he was father @-@ in @-@ law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Place of a skull , " which is called in Hebrew , " golgotha , "
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " Jesus of NAZARETH , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
but there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don 't know where they have laid him ! "
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
when therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
that disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It 's the Lord ! " so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around him ( for he was naked ) , and threw himself into the sea .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
most certainly I tell you , when you were young , you dressed yourself , and walked where you wanted to . but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will dress you , and carry you where you don 't want to go . "
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
being assembled together with them , he commanded them , " Don 't depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which you heard from me .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
when they had come in , they went up into the upper room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
therefore , being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the flesh , he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne ,
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
Peter said to them , " repent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
for Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
you are the children of the prophets , and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers , saying to Abraham , ' In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed . '
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and all that is in them ;
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Christ . '
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira , his wife , sold a possession ,
by the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
now when the high priest , the captain of the temple , and the chief priests heard these words , they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this .
we are His witnesses of these things ; and so also is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . "
they agreed with him . summoning the Apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
but some of those who were of the synagogue called " The Libertines , " and of the Cyrenians , of the Alexandrians , and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose , disputing with Stephen .
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
'i will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage , ' said God , ' and after that will they come out , and serve me in this place . '
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
" our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness , even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen ;
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
Saul was consenting to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the Apostles .
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them . they came out , crying with a loud voice . many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
now when the Apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
he arose and went ; and behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . as a lamb before his shearer is silent , so he doesn 't open his mouth .
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away , and the eunuch didn 't see him any more , for he went on his way rejoicing .
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
when Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus . he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists , but they were seeking to kill him .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened in those days that she fell sick , and died . when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
when the angel who spoke to him had departed , Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
send therefore to Joppa , and summon Simon , who is surnamed Peter . he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner , by the seaside . when he comes , he will speak to you . '
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they also killed , hanging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
they of the circumcision who believed were amazed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles .
when I had looked intently at it , I considered , and saw the four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky .
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
the report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem . they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch ,
when he had arrested him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him , intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover .
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Herod dressed himself in royal clothing , sat on the throne , and gave a speech to them .
now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
as John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . but behold , one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . '
for those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they didn 't know him , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
for so has the Lord commanded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gentiles , that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth . ' "
at Lystra a certain man sat , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
but when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes , and sprang into the multitude , crying out ,
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Barnabas , and some others of them , to go up to Jerusalem to the Apostles and elders about this question .
when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the Apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your souls , saying , ' You must be circumcised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no commandment ;
after some days Paul said to Barnabas , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
but Paul didn 't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia , and didn 't go with them to do the work .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the Apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
the jailer , being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also , they came there likewise , agitating the multitudes .
now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignorance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained ; of which he has given assurance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem , but I will return again to you if God Wills , " he set sail from Ephesus .
this man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
he began to speak boldly in the synagogue . but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
the whole city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , having seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in confusion . most of them didn 't know why they had come together .
if therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . let them press charges against one another .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and eaten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he departed .
sailing from there , we came the following day opposite Chios . the next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium , and the day after we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
" now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
they , when they heard it , glorified God . they said to him , " You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed , and they are all zealous for the law .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
some shouted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he couldn 't find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , beckoned with his hand to the people . when there was a great silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Damascus , about noon , suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me .
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting to his death , and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " Rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn 't fit to live ! "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
he even tried to profane the temple , and we arrested him .
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
as he reasoned about righteousness , self @-@ control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will summon you . "
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
when therefore they had come together here , I didn 't delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought .
so on the next day , when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of Festus , Paul was brought in .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
but declared first to them of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , doing works worthy of repentance .
embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
when we had sailed slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus , the wind not allowing us further , we sailed under the Lee of Crete , opposite Salmone .
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
after they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven along .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " Sirs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
when he had said this , and had taken bread , he gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it , and began to eat .
when it was day , they didn 't recognize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cured .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three taverns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
saying , ' Go to this people , and say , in hearing , you will hear , but will in no way understand . in seeing , you will see , but will in no way perceive .
for this people 's heart has grown callous . their ears are dull of hearing . their eyes they have closed . Lest they should see with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their heart , and would turn again , and I would heal them . '
for I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yours and mine .
so , as much as is in me , I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; that they may be without excuse .
and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four @-@ footed animals , and creeping things .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
backbiters , hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law . as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
for it isn 't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be justified
( for when Gentiles who don 't have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
you therefore who teach another , don 't you teach yourself ? you who preach that a man shouldn 't steal , do you steal ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a liar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prevail when you come into judgment . "
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
they have all turned aside . they have together become unprofitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they might be in uncircumcision , that righteousness might also be accounted to them .
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn 't through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " So will your seed be . "
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he didn 't waver through unbelief , but grew strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
for I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don 't find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for what the law couldn 't do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
for if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are children of God .
for I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us .
but if we hope for that which we don 't see , we wait for it with patience .
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don 't know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can 't be uttered .
whom he predestined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also glorified .
who is he who condemns ? it is Christ who died , yes rather , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who also makes intercession for us .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
for he said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
for the Scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
as he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
" it will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , who didn 't follow after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith ;
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they didn 't subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
and how will they preach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace , who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
but I ask , didn 't Israel know ? first Moses says , " I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation , with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry . "
Isaiah is very bold , and says , " I was found by those who didn 't seek me . I was revealed to those who didn 't ask for me . "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
and so all Israel will be saved . even as it is written , " There will come out of Zion the Deliverer , and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
for rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
the night is far gone , and the day is near . let 's therefore throw off the works of darkness , and let 's put on the armor of light .
Don 't let him who eats despise him who doesn 't eat . Don 't let him who doesn 't eat judge him who eats , for God has accepted him .
he who observes the day , observes it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who doesn 't eat , to the Lord he doesn 't eat , and gives God thanks .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
Don 't overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating .
it is good to not eat meat , drink wine , nor do anything by which your brother stumbles , is offended , or is made weak .
but I write the more boldly to you in part , as reminding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
but , as it is written , " They will see , to whom no news of him came . they who haven 't heard will understand . "
yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
I commend to you Phoebe , our sister , who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae ,
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a helper of many , and of my own self .
now I beg you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doctrine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don 't serve our Lord , Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by their smooth and flattering speech , they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
we speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
but as it is written , " Things which an eye didn 't see , and an ear didn 't hear , which didn 't enter into the heart of man , these God has prepared for those who love him . "
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
now the natural man doesn 't receive the things of God 's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can 't know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
for you are still fleshly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren 't you fleshly , and don 't you walk in the ways of men ?
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yours ,
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord is willing . and I will know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power .
it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father 's wife .
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
Don 't you know that the saints will judge the world ? and if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
if then , you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
or don 't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one flesh . "
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
but , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife doesn 't have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband doesn 't have authority over his own body , but the wife .
Don 't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn 't tempt you because of your lack of self @-@ control .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from cares . he who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
so then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn 't give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
if to others I am not an Apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
to the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
now I do this for the sake of the Good News , that I may be a joint partaker of it .
but I beat my body and bring it into submission , lest by any means , after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don 't desire that you would have fellowship with demons .
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
but if one of those who don 't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to idols , " don 't eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience . for " the earth is the Lord 's , and all its fullness . "
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
but in giving you this command , I don 't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
when therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not the Lord 's Supper that you eat .
in the same way he also took the cup , after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
but when we are judged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
if the foot would say , " Because I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ;
if I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don 't have love , I am nothing .
if I dole out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don 't have love , it profits me nothing .
love never fails . but where there are prophecies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will cease . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would prophesy . for he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interprets , that the assembly may be built up .
but now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with other languages , what would I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of revelation , or of knowledge , or of prophesying , or of teaching ?
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn 't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
if then I don 't know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the " Amen " at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn 't know what you say ?
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe .
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
for I am the least of the Apostles , who is not worthy to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn 't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
there is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
as is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now concerning Apollos , the brother , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not at all his desire to come now ; but he will come when he has an opportunity .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
but if we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation . if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer .
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wouldn 't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears , not that you should be made sorry , but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you .
but if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
for most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect , by reason of the glory that surpasses .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for most certainly in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven ;
for indeed we who are in this tent do groan , being burdened ; not that we desire to be unclothed , but that we desire to be clothed , that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
we are courageous , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for we are not commending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . behold , all things have become new .
namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their trespasses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us : we beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
for even when we had come into Macedonia , our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side . Fightings were outside . fear was inside .
so although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
for if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
as for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker for you . as for our brothers , they are the Apostles of the assemblies , the glory of Christ .
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints , but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ;
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ;
while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Christ 's , so also we are Christ 's .
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
I have been in travels often , perils of rivers , perils of robbers , perils from my countrymen , perils from the Gentiles , perils in the city , perils in the wilderness , perils in the sea , perils among false brothers ;
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations , that I should not be exalted excessively , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to torment me , that I should not be exalted excessively .
he has said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . " most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses , that the power of Christ may rest on me .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
for he was crucified through weakness , yet he lives through the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we will live with him through the power of God toward you .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
for this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different " good news " ;
and there isn 't another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to pervert the Good News of Christ .
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be Cursed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cursed .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Good News which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Good News might continue with you .
but from those who were reputed to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God doesn 't show partiality to man ) --they , I say , who were respected imparted nothing to me ,
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision , even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @-@ breaker .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . for it is written , " Cursed is everyone who doesn 't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
now I say this . a Covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not annul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
so that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
what was the blessing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren 't tempted .
for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption . but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
as many as desire to look good in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
for even they who receive circumcision don 't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body .
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love ;
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
so then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and of the household of God ,
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ;
that we may no longer be children , tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in craftiness , after the wiles of error ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk , in the futility of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
and put on the new man , who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
let him who stole steal no more ; but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are reproved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reveals is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Savior of the body .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one flesh . "
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the principalities , against the powers , against the world 's rulers of the darkness of this age , and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus .
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are just , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don 't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
and through him to reconcile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
for I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you , and for those at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in Thanksgiving .
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us ; and he has taken it out of the way , nailing it to the cross ;
let no one therefore judge you in eating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day ,
if then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth .
whatever you do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father , through him .
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , greets you , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( concerning whom you received commandments , " if he comes to you , receive him " ) ,
for I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as Apostles of Christ .
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
but let us , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
this is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
Don 't you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an Apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
for bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
for this , I was appointed as a preacher , an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don 't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear .
traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to convict those who contradict him .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
for to which of the angels did he say at any time , " You are my Son . today have I become your father ? " and again , " I will be to him a Father , and he will be to me a Son ? "
but which of the angels has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? "
God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ?
you have put all things in subjection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don 't see all things subjected to him , yet .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make Atonement for the sins of the people .
for indeed we have had good news preached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard didn 't profit them , because it wasn 't mixed with faith by those who heard .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I swore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold tightly to our confession .
for we don 't have a high priest who can 't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
the high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
in this way God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
they indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest 's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Abraham ,
( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord swore and will not change his mind , ' You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . ' "
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
for if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
for finding fault with them , he said , " behold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
" for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
in that he says , " A new Covenant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away .
for a tabernacle was prepared . in the first part were the lampstand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place .
having a golden altar of incense , and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tablets of the Covenant ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
" this is the Covenant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
but we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul .
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
by faith , Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . yes , he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son ;
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ,
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
they were stoned . they were sawn apart . they were tempted . they were slain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill @-@ treated
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not children .
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
for they could not stand that which was commanded , " If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned " ;
this phrase , " Yet once more , " signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . "
Don 't be carried away by various and strange teachings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal Covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
but if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
for the sun arises with the scorching wind , and Withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits .
blessed is the man who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , " I am tempted by God , " for God can 't be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets , but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn 't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man 's religion is worthless .
listen , my beloved brothers . Didn 't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
with it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who are made in the image of God .
but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don 't boast and don 't lie against the truth .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
Don 't speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies .
you have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure . you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
Don 't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won 't be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
if you call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judges according to each man 's work , pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear :
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
for this is the will of God , that by well @-@ doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
for what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? but if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God .
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ;
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears open to their prayer ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
beloved , don 't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you .
if you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don 't obey the Good News of God ?
when the chief shepherd is revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn 't fade away .
likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the elder . yes , all of you clothe yourselves with humility , to subject yourselves to one another ; for " God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
Simon Peter , a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the Apostles of the Lord and Savior :
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware , lest being carried away with the error of the wicked , you fall from your own steadfastness .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sins , we have a counselor with the Father , Jesus Christ , the righteous .
one who says , " I know him , " and doesn 't keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth isn 't in him .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perfected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
he who says he is in the light and hates his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
but he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and doesn 't know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , little children , because you know the Father .
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
they went out from us , but they didn 't belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
I have not written to you because you don 't know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? this is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
beloved , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . but we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
he who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
this is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he commanded .
and every spirit who doesn 't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Antichrist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
we are of God . he who knows God listens to us . he who is not of God doesn 't listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
if a man says , " I love God , " and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who doesn 't love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
this is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . it is the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
for there are three who testify :
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he listens to us .
and if we know that he listens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
we know that whoever is born of God doesn 't sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the evil one doesn 't touch him .
we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . this is the true God , and eternal life .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
this is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . this is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
watch yourselves , that we don 't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
having many things to write to you , I don 't want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
beloved , don 't imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does evil hasn 't seen God .
now I desire to remind you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who didn 't believe .
but Michael , the Archangel , when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebuke you ! "
this is the revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two @-@ edged sword . his face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " Don 't be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen hereafter ;
the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands . the seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies . the seven lampstands are seven assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things :
remember therefore from where you have fallen , and repent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you swiftly , and will move your lampstand out of its place , unless you repent .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
I will kill her children with Death , and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts . I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
" and to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write : " he who has the seven spirits of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
" to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write : " he who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who shuts and no one opens , says these things :
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and didn 't deny my name .
behold , I give of the synagogue of Satan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . behold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have loved you .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
" to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : " the Amen , the faithful and True Witness , the Head of God 's creation , says these things :
because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten riches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don 't know that you are the wretched one , miserable , poor , blind , and naked ;
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
before the throne was something like a sea of glass , similar to crystal . in the midst of the throne , and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
no one in heaven above , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a lamb standing , as though it had been slain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @-@ four elders fell down before the lamb , each one having a harp , and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it had a bow . a crown was given to him , and he came forth conquering , and to conquer .
when he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , " Come and see ! " and behold , a black horse , and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
a long white robe was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
the kings of the earth , the princes , the commanding officers , the rich , the strong , and every slave and free person , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
saying , " Don 't harm the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " salvation be to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the lamb ! "
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the lamb 's blood .
for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel 's hand .
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
the first sounded , and there followed hail and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth . one third of the earth was burnt up , and one third of the trees were burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wormwood . " one third of the waters became wormwood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don 't have God 's seal on their foreheads .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
they had breastplates , like breastplates of iron . the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , or of many horses rushing to war .
they have over them as king the angel of the abyss . his name in Hebrew is " Abaddon , " but in Greek , he has the name " Apollyon . "
thus I saw the horses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having breastplates of fiery red , hyacinth blue , and sulfur yellow ; and the heads of lions . out of their mouths proceed fire , smoke , and sulfur .
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they didn 't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clothed with a cloud . a rainbow was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
when the seven thunders sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Seal up the things which the seven thunders said , and don 't write them . "
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
leave out the court which is outside of the temple , and don 't measure it , for it has been given to the nations . they will tread the holy city under foot for forty @-@ two months .
when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
after the three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered into them , and they stood on their feet . great fear fell on those who saw them .
in that day there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
they overcame him because of the lamb 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they didn 't love their life , even to death .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . Woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman , that she might fly into the wilderness to her place , so that she might be nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the dragon grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , who keep God 's commandments and hold Jesus ' testimony .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
they worshiped the dragon , because he gave his authority to the beast , and they worshiped the beast , saying , " Who is like the beast ? who is able to make war with him ? "
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as wouldn 't worship the image of the beast to be killed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
here is wisdom . he who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred sixty @-@ six .
I saw , and behold , the lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their foreheads .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
another , a second angel , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality . "
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sickle , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
the winepress was trodden outside of the city , and blood came out from the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadia .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
people were scorched with great heat , and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues . they didn 't repent and give him glory .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . they gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . they didn 't repent of their works .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
the seventh poured out his bowl into the air . a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God , to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality , and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality . "
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
he cried with a mighty voice , saying , " fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , and she has become a habitation of demons , a prison of every unclean spirit , and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird !
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the cup which she mixed , mix to her double .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Thus with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived .
in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth . "
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . for the marriage of the lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "
it was given to her that she would array herself in bright , pure , fine linen : for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " King of Kings , and Lord of lords . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
the rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse , the sword which came forth out of his mouth . all the birds were filled with their flesh .
he seized the dragon , the old serpent , which is the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole inhabited earth , and bound him for a thousand years ,
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
they went up over the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints , and the beloved city . fire came down out of heaven from God , and devoured them .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he said to me , " It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life .
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls , who were loaded with the seven last plagues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the lamb 's bride . "
having a great and high wall ; having twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels ; and names written on them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to shine , for the very glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp is the lamb .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb ,
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
he who acts unjustly , let him act unjustly still . he who is filthy , let him be filthy still . he who is righteous , let him do righteousness still . he who is holy , let him be holy still . "
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
the Spirit and the bride say , " Come ! " he who hears , let him say , " Come ! " he who is thirsty , let him come . he who desires , let him take the water of life freely .
if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , may God take away his part from the tree of life , and out of the holy city , which are written in this book .
