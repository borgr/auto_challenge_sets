the man gave names to all li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a hel@@ per su@@ itable for him .
the eyes of both of them were opened , and they knew that they were nak@@ ed . they se@@ wed fi@@ g leaves together , and made themselves ap@@ r@@ ons .
I will put en@@ mity between you and the woman , and between your off@@ spring and her off@@ spring . he will bru@@ ise your head , and you will bru@@ ise his he@@ el . "
they said , " C@@ ome , let 's build ourselves a city , and a to@@ wer whose top reaches to the sky , and let 's make ourselves a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad on the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th . "
so lot chose the Pla@@ in of the Jordan for himself . lot trav@@ eled east , and they separated themselves the one from the other .
it happened the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had du@@ g , and said to him , " We have found water . "
I@@ sa@@ ac sent Jac@@ o@@ b away . he went to Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m to Lab@@ an , son of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian , Re@@ bek@@ ah 's brother , Jac@@ o@@ b 's and E@@ sa@@ u 's mother .
Jac@@ o@@ b saw the expression on Lab@@ an 's face , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
now that you have felt around in all my stu@@ ff , what have you found of all your household stu@@ ff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
then you shall say , ' They are your ser@@ vant , Jac@@ o@@ b 's . it is a present sent to my lor@@ d , E@@ sa@@ u . be@@ hold , he also is behind us . ' "
he himself passed over in front of them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
he asked P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's officers who were with him in custody in his master 's house , saying , " Wh@@ y do you look so sad today ? "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with gra@@ in , and to restore each man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not sp@@ ies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that be@@ hold , each man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
for your ser@@ vant became col@@ lateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don '@@ t bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father fore@@ ver . '
then Joseph co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cri@@ ed , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
he gave each one of them changes of clo@@ thing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clo@@ thing .
he sent the following to his father : ten don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with gra@@ in and bread and provision for his father by the way .
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , revi@@ ved .
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
Joseph fell on his father 's face , we@@ pt on him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
Joseph returned into Egyp@@ t@@ -@@ -@@ he , and his brothers , and all that went up with him to bur@@ y his father , after he had buried his father .
it happened , because the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves fear@@ ed God , that he gave them families .
go yo@@ ur@@ selves , get stra@@ w where you can find it , for nothing of your work shall be dimin@@ ished . ' "
no stra@@ w is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Mak@@ e bri@@ ck ! ' and be@@ hold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not dimin@@ ish anything from your daily qu@@ ota of bri@@ cks ! "
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that the rain and the ha@@ il and the th@@ unders were ce@@ ased , he sin@@ ned yet more , and har@@ dened his heart , he and his servants .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ et one pla@@ gue more will I bring on P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will su@@ rely th@@ rust you out altogether .
speak to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , a lam@@ b for a household ;
in the first day there shall be to you a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
then Mos@@ es called for all the el@@ ders of Israel , and said to them , " Dra@@ w out , and take lam@@ bs according to your families , and kill the P@@ ass@@ over .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
Mos@@ es told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Yah@@ we@@ h had done to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , all the hard@@ ships that had come on them on the way , and how Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them .

Mos@@ es said , " Con@@ sec@@ rate yo@@ ur@@ selves today to Yah@@ we@@ h , yes , every man against his son , and against his brother ; that he may bes@@ to@@ w on you a b@@ les@@ sing this day . "
Mos@@ es returned to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " O@@ h , this people have sin@@ ned a great sin , and have made themselves go@@ ds of gold .
it happened , when Mos@@ es came down from Mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Mos@@ es di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one by reason of his speaking with him .
Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ el and O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted man , in whose heart Yah@@ we@@ h had put wis@@ dom , even everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come to the work to do it :

he made the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se of ac@@ ac@@ ia wood . it was square : its length was a cu@@ bit , and its b@@ read@@ th a cu@@ bit . its he@@ ight was two cu@@ bi@@ ts . its hor@@ ns were of one piece with it .
which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es in Mount S@@ ina@@ i , in the day that he comman@@ ded the children of Israel to offer their offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
Mos@@ es brought Aaron 's sons , and clo@@ th@@ ed them with co@@ ats , and tied s@@ ashes on them , and put head@@ bands on them ; as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
so Aaron drew near to the alt@@ ar , and killed the cal@@ f of the sin offering , which was for himself .

Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning , mu@@ ster@@ ed the people , and went up , he and the el@@ ders of Israel , before the people to A@@ I .

they also res@@ or@@ ted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ ke@@ ys , and win@@ esk@@ ins , old and torn and bound up ,
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,

Jon@@ athan said , " F@@ ar be it from you ; for if I should at all know that ev@@ il were determined by my father to come on you , then wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I tell you that ? "
Sa@@ ul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Benj@@ am@@ ites ! will the son of J@@ es@@ se give everyone of you fields and v@@ ine@@ yards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
David knew that Sa@@ ul was dev@@ ising mis@@ chief against him ; and he said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , " Br@@ ing the ep@@ ho@@ d here . "
David said , " As Yah@@ we@@ h lives , Yah@@ we@@ h will strike him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall go down into battle and per@@ ish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . Sa@@ ul had put away those who had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
when his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er saw that Sa@@ ul was dead , he likewise fell on his s@@ word , and died with him .
David said to the young man who told him , " Ho@@ w do you know that Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son are dead ? "
David perceived that Yah@@ we@@ h had established him king over Israel , and that he had ex@@ al@@ ted his k@@ ing@@ dom for his people Israel 's sake .
David took him more conc@@ ub@@ ines and wi@@ ves out of Jer@@ usalem , after he had come from He@@ br@@ on ; and there were yet sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters born to David .
I will be yet more v@@ ile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the hand@@ ma@@ ids of whom you have spoken , they shall hon@@ or me . "
it happened after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om prepared him a char@@ i@@ ot and hor@@ ses , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
Ara@@ un@@ ah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
then Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ex@@ al@@ ted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
then Na@@ than spoke to B@@ ath@@ she@@ ba the mother of Solomon , saying , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard that Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h re@@ ig@@ ns , and David our lor@@ d do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know it ?
the king sent and called for Shi@@ me@@ i , and said to him , " Bu@@ ild yo@@ ur@@ self a house in Jer@@ usalem , and d@@ well there , and don '@@ t go out from there anywhere .
Solomon was building his own house thir@@ teen years , and he finished all his house .
there were four supports at the four cor@@ ners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
( for they are your people , and your inher@@ it@@ ance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron ) ;
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the king 's house
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Mil@@ lo .
however I will not tear away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but I will give one tri@@ be to your son , for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was returned , that they sent and called him to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
but have done ev@@ il above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and have cast me behind your back :
for they also built them high places , and pil@@ lars , and Ash@@ er@@ im , on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Yah@@ we@@ h his God gave him a lam@@ p in Jer@@ usalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jer@@ usalem ;
he brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben Had@@ ad list@@ ened to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel Beth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
Om@@ ri did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly above all who were before him .
A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h above all that were before him .
A@@ ha@@ b made the Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ ha@@ b did yet more to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
the servants of the king of Syria said to him , " The@@ ir go@@ d is a go@@ d of the hil@@ ls ; therefore they were stronger than we . but let us fight against them in the pla@@ in , and su@@ rely we shall be stronger than they .
but there was none like A@@ ha@@ b , who sold himself to do that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , whom J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel his wife s@@ tir@@ red up .
the king of Israel said to J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I tell you that he would not pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y good concerning me , but ev@@ il ? "
when they came down to him , E@@ lis@@ ha pray@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " P@@ le@@ ase strike this people with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness . " he struck them with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness according to the word of E@@ lis@@ ha .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and had fear@@ ed other go@@ ds ,
they for@@ so@@ ok all the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served Ba@@ al .
they caused their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and en@@ chan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
he tr@@ usted in Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor among them that were before him .
'@@ For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake . ' "
I will add to your days fif@@ teen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake . " ' "
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
they killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he spoke kin@@ dly to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings who were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ,
Az@@ ub@@ ah died , and Cal@@ e@@ b took to him E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath , who b@@ ore him H@@ ur .
when his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er saw that Sa@@ ul was dead , he likewise fell on his s@@ word , and died .
David perceived that Yah@@ we@@ h had established him king over Israel ; for his k@@ ing@@ dom was ex@@ al@@ ted on high , for his people Israel 's sake .
David took more wi@@ ves at Jer@@ usalem ; and David became the father of more sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the Ar@@ k of God , and pit@@ ched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the Ar@@ k of God but the L@@ evi@@ tes . for Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen them to carry the Ar@@ k of God , and to minister to him fore@@ ver . "
at that time , when David saw that Yah@@ we@@ h had answ@@ ered him in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , then he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there .
now , my son , may Yah@@ we@@ h be with you and prosp@@ er you , and build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as he has spoken concerning you .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
now Solomon pur@@ posed to build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and a house for his k@@ ing@@ dom .
Solomon sent to Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re , saying , " As you dealt with David my father , and sent him c@@ ed@@ ars to build him a house in which to d@@ well , so deal with me .
then hear from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
Hur@@ am sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Op@@ hir , and f@@ et@@ ched from there four hundred fif@@ ty tal@@ ents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
King Solomon gave to the qu@@ een of She@@ ba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
but you be strong , and don '@@ t let your hands be S@@ lack ; for your work shall be re@@ warded . "
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
for the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h run back and forth throughout the whole ear@@ th , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in you have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly ; for from hen@@ ce@@ forth you shall have wars . "
he placed forces in all the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
and next to him A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
the king of Israel said to J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I tell you that he would not pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y good concerning me , but ev@@ il ? "
he set judges in the land throughout all the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , city by city ,
after this J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h joined himself with A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Israel . the same did very w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly :
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between himself , and all the people , and the king , that they should be Yah@@ we@@ h 's people .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now it happened , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se to them .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yah@@ we@@ h , God made him to prosp@@ er .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did cor@@ rup@@ tly , and he t@@ res@@ passed against Yah@@ we@@ h his God ; for he went into Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le to bur@@ n incen@@ se on the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
but H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ren@@ der again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wr@@ ath on him , and on Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
moreover he provided him cities , and pos@@ sessions of f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds in ab@@ und@@ ance ; for God had given him very much sub@@ stance .
Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
the ar@@ chers shot at king Jos@@ i@@ ah ; and the king said to his servants , " T@@ ake me away , because I am seriously wounded ! "
so his servants took him out of the char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tom@@ bs of his fa@@ thers . all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart against turning to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
" thus says Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en , has given me all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th ; and he has comman@@ ded me to build him a house in Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes had pur@@ ified themselves together ; all of them were p@@ ure : and they killed the P@@ ass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brothers the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
for E@@ z@@ ra had set his heart to seek the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces .
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves and for their sons , so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers has been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass . "
and that who@@ ever di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come within three days , according to the coun@@ sel of the pr@@ inces and the el@@ ders , all his sub@@ stance should be for@@ fe@@ ited , and himself separated from the assembly of the cap@@ tivity .
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have re@@ deemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
yes , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed aw@@ ful b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies ;
the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes pur@@ ified themselves ; and they pur@@ ified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
Es@@ ther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Ham@@ an come today to the ban@@ qu@@ et that I have prepared for him . "
nevertheless Ham@@ an re@@ strained himself , and went home . there , he sent and called for his friends and Zer@@ es@@ h his wife .
Ham@@ an re@@ counted to them the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , the multi@@ tude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
'@@ S@@ hall mort@@ al man be more just than God ? shall a man be more p@@ ure than his Mak@@ er ?
" no doubt , but you are the people , and wis@@ dom shall die with you .
the ten@@ ts of rob@@ bers prosp@@ er . those who prov@@ oke God are secure , who carry their God in their hands .
he lo@@ os@@ ens the bond of kings . he bin@@ ds their wa@@ ist with a bel@@ t .
" only don '@@ t do two things to me ; then I will not hide myself from your face :
but his f@@ les@@ h on him has p@@ ain , and his sou@@ l within him mour@@ ns . "
your own m@@ outh condem@@ ns you , and not I@@ . Y@@ es , your own li@@ ps testify against you .
have you heard the secret coun@@ sel of God ? do you limit wis@@ dom to yo@@ ur@@ self ?
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the nec@@ k , and d@@ ashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neigh@@ bor !
" now give a pledge , be col@@ lateral for me with yo@@ ur@@ self . who is there who will strike hands with me ?
you who tear yo@@ ur@@ self in your an@@ ger , shall the ear@@ th be for@@ sak@@ en for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
if indeed you will mag@@ ni@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves against me , and p@@ lead against me my re@@ pro@@ ach ;
look at me , and be ast@@ on@@ ished . lay your hand on your m@@ outh .
I would declare to him the number of my ste@@ p@@ s@@ . as a pr@@ ince would I go near to him .
yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Jo@@ b , or who answ@@ ered his words , among you .
she deals har@@ sh@@ ly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her la@@ bor is in v@@ ain , she is without fear ,
will you even annul my judgment ? will you condemn me , that you may be justified ?
he sees everything that is high . he is king over all the sons of pride . "
therefore I ab@@ h@@ or myself , and rep@@ ent in d@@ ust and ashes . "
for he has not desp@@ ised nor ab@@ hor@@ red the aff@@ li@@ ction of the aff@@ lic@@ ted , Ne@@ ither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cri@@ ed to him , he heard .
the friendship of Yah@@ we@@ h is with those who fear him . he will show them his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
O@@ h love Yah@@ we@@ h , all you his sa@@ ints ! Yah@@ we@@ h preser@@ ves the fa@@ ith@@ ful , and fully re@@ compen@@ ses him who beha@@ ves ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ tly .
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h 's eye is on those who fear him , on those who hope in his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness ;
yes , they opened their m@@ outh wide against me . they said , " A@@ ha ! A@@ ha ! our eye has seen it ! "
for he f@@ lat@@ ters himself in his own eyes , too much to detec@@ t and h@@ ate his sin .
for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t get the land in possession by their own s@@ word , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favor@@ able to them .
but it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h my ref@@ uge , that I may tell of all your works .
then I thought , " I will appeal to this : the years of the right hand of the Most High . "
your way was through the sea ; your p@@ aths through the great waters . your foot@@ steps were not known .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember his hand , nor the day when he re@@ deemed them from the ad@@ versary ;

you will only look with your eyes , and see the re@@ compen@@ se of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
for as the heav@@ ens are high above the ear@@ th , so great is his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness toward those who fear him .

he lays the be@@ ams of his rooms in the waters . he makes the cl@@ ou@@ ds his char@@ i@@ ot . he walk@@ s on the w@@ ings of the wind .
he has given food to those who fear him . he always re@@ members his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .

D@@ on '@@ t be wise in your own eyes . fear Yah@@ we@@ h , and de@@ part from ev@@ il .

I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wis@@ dom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
I said to myself , " be@@ hold , I have obtained for myself great wis@@ dom above all who were before me in Jer@@ usalem . yes , my heart has had great experience of wis@@ dom and knowledge . "
I said in my heart , " C@@ ome now , I will test you with mir@@ th : therefore enjoy pleas@@ ure " ; and be@@ hold , this also was van@@ ity .
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he conten@@ d with him who is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than he .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , and in the day of ad@@ versity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
a fo@@ ol also multi@@ p@@ lies words . man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what will be ; and that which will be after him , who can tell him ?

the rest of it he makes into a go@@ d , even his en@@ gra@@ ved image . he bo@@ ws down to it and wor@@ ships , and pr@@ ays to it , and says , " D@@ eli@@ ver me ; for you are my go@@ d ! "
they bear it on the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry it , and set it in its place , and it stands , from its place it shall not move : yes , one may cry to it , yet it can not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be prof@@ an@@ ed ? I will not give my gl@@ ory to another .
and he has made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand , he has hidden me : and he has made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver has he kept me close :
Is@@ n '@@ t it you who dri@@ ed up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the re@@ deemed to pass over ?
" cry al@@ oud , don '@@ t spar@@ e , lift up your voice like a tr@@ ump@@ et , and declare to my people their dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b their sin@@ s .
the way of peace they don '@@ t know ; and there is no justice in their go@@ ings : they have made them cro@@ oked p@@ aths ; who@@ ever goes there@@ in does not know peace .
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has proclaimed to the end of the ear@@ th , " S@@ ay to the daughter of Z@@ ion , ' be@@ hold , your sal@@ vation comes . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him . ' "
they shall not la@@ bor in v@@ ain , nor bring forth for cal@@ am@@ ity ; for they are the se@@ ed of the b@@ les@@ sed of Yah@@ we@@ h , and their off@@ spring with them .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " What un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness have your fa@@ thers found in me , that they have gone far from me , and have walked after van@@ ity , and are become v@@ ain ?
" for my people have committed two ev@@ ils : they have for@@ sak@@ en me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out c@@ ister@@ ns , broken c@@ ister@@ ns , that can hold no water .
" return , back@@ sli@@ ding children , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Z@@ ion .
a lion is gone up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land de@@ so@@ late , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabi@@ tant .
" tell the nations ; be@@ hold , publish against Jer@@ usalem , ' wat@@ chers come from a far country , and raise their voice against the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known ; and I will send the s@@ word after them , until I have consu@@ med them .
you shall not take a wife , neither shall you have sons or da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , in this place .
you , even of yo@@ ur@@ self , shall dis@@ continue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enem@@ ies in the land which you don '@@ t know : for you have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in my an@@ ger which shall bur@@ n fore@@ ver .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge that s@@ its on eg@@ gs which she has not laid , so is he who gets ri@@ ches , and not by right ; in the mid@@ st of his days they shall leave him , and at his end he shall be a fo@@ ol .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them ; for they have du@@ g a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y my voice .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken ves@@ sel ? is he a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts ? why are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into the land which they don '@@ t know ?
I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , until they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
yet you have not list@@ ened to me , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; that you may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with the work of your hands to your own hurt .
Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and its kings , and its pr@@ inces , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , a his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se , as it is this day ;
then spoke the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets to the pr@@ inces and to all the people , saying , This man is wor@@ thy of death ; for he has pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against this city , as you have heard with your e@@ ars .
and give them a command to their mas@@ ters , saying , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , You shall tell your mas@@ ters :
now therefore , why have you not re@@ bu@@ ked Jerem@@ i@@ ah of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , who makes himself a pro@@ phe@@ t to you ,
it shall come to pass in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , that I will break his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and will bur@@ st your bonds ; and st@@ ran@@ gers shall no more make him their bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will turn again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on his d@@ wel@@ ling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
for Yah@@ we@@ h has ran@@ so@@ med Jac@@ o@@ b , and re@@ deemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he .
set up road signs , make guide@@ posts ; set your heart toward the highway , even the way by which you went : turn again , vir@@ gin of Israel , turn again to these your cities .
I bought the field that was in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th of Han@@ ame@@ l my un@@ cle 's son , and weighed him the money , even se@@ ven@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els of silver .
and I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear me fore@@ ver , for their good , and of their children after them :
when the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army was fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish and against Az@@ ek@@ ah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h as for@@ ti@@ fied cities .
but you turned and prof@@ an@@ ed my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom you had let go free at their pleas@@ ure , to return ; and you brought them into subj@@ ection , to be to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , list@@ ened to the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
therefore my wr@@ ath and my an@@ ger was p@@ oured forth , and was kin@@ d@@ led in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ; and they are was@@ ted and de@@ so@@ late , as it is this day .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b . he is very proud ; his lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of his heart .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neigh@@ b@@ ors ; and he is no more .
and he spoke kin@@ dly to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings who were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ,
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; all her gates are de@@ so@@ late , her pri@@ ests do si@@ gh : her vir@@ g@@ ins are aff@@ lic@@ ted , and she her@@ self is in bit@@ ter@@ ness .
from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her maj@@ es@@ ty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have bo@@ iled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
then the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rus@@ hing , saying , b@@ les@@ sed be the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h from his place .
make the chain ; for the land is full of blo@@ ody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
to the others he said in my hearing , G@@ o through the city after him , and strike : D@@ on '@@ t let your eye spar@@ e , neither have p@@ ity ;
that you have built for yo@@ ur@@ selves a va@@ ulted place , and have made yo@@ ur@@ selves a lo@@ f@@ ty place in every street .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , ful@@ l@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
has given forth on interest , and has taken increase ; shall he then live ? he shall not live : he has done all these ab@@ omin@@ ations ; he shall su@@ rely die ; his blood shall be on him .
and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day when I chose Israel , and s@@ wor@@ e to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I s@@ wor@@ e to them , saying , I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ;
in that day I s@@ wor@@ e to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
moreover also I gave them my Sab@@ ba@@ ths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h who sanc@@ ti@@ fies them .
S@@ lan@@ der@@ ous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have e@@ aten on the mountains : in the mid@@ st of you they have committed le@@ w@@ d@@ ness .
I saw that she was def@@ iled ; they both took one way .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city ! I also will make the p@@ ile great .
your ti@@ res shall be on your heads , and your sho@@ es on your feet : you shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but you shall p@@ ine away in your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mo@@ an one toward another .
they shall make a sp@@ oil of your ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleas@@ ant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your tim@@ ber and your d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the waters .
by your wis@@ dom and by your understanding you have gotten yo@@ ur@@ self ri@@ ches , and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you have set your heart as the heart of God ,
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . house of Israel , I will judge every one of you after his ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely because my she@@ ep became a pre@@ y , and my she@@ ep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my she@@ ep , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fe@@ ed my she@@ ep ;
they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , in which your fa@@ thers lived ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , they , and their children , and their children 's children , fore@@ ver : and David my ser@@ vant shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall pl@@ under those who pl@@ under@@ ed them , and ro@@ b those who ro@@ bbed them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions did I to them ; and I hi@@ d my face from them .
in the day that he goes into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , into the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
on that day shall the pr@@ ince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bul@@ l for a sin offering .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : if the pr@@ ince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inher@@ it@@ ance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inher@@ it@@ ance .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Y@@ our God whom you serve continu@@ ally , he will deliver you .
yes , it mag@@ ni@@ fied itself , even to the pr@@ ince of the army ; and it took away from him the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosp@@ er in his hand ; and he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the pr@@ ince of pr@@ inces ; but he shall be broken without hand .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
neither shall he regard the go@@ ds of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d ; for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
so he went and took Go@@ mer the daughter of Di@@ bla@@ im ; and she conce@@ ived , and b@@ ore him a son .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
I will give her v@@ ine@@ yards from there , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me fore@@ ver . yes , I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , in justice , in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , and in comp@@ as@@ sion .
I will so@@ w her to me in the ear@@ th ; and I will have mer@@ cy on her who had not obtained mer@@ cy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
the pride of Israel testi@@ fies to his face . therefore Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will st@@ um@@ ble in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . Ju@@ da@@ h also will st@@ um@@ ble with them .
the pride of Israel testi@@ fies to his face ; yet they ha@@ ven '@@ t returned to Yah@@ we@@ h their God , nor sought him , for all this .
though I have ta@@ ught and strengthened their arms , yet they plot ev@@ il against me .
yet I ta@@ ught E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to walk . I took them by his arms ; but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that I he@@ aled them .
he said to them , " I am a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , and I fear Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en , who has made the sea and the d@@ ry land . "
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the sha@@ de , until he might see what would become of the city .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O ear@@ th , and all that is there@@ in : and let the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h be witness against you , the Lord from his hol@@ y temp@@ le .
I will u@@ pro@@ ot your Ash@@ er@@ im out of your mid@@ st ; and I will destroy your cities .
he re@@ bu@@ kes the sea , and makes it d@@ ry , and dri@@ es up all the rivers . B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ hes , and Car@@ mel ; and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ hes .
then he swe@@ ep@@ s by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his go@@ d . "
therefore he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es to his net , and bur@@ ns incen@@ se to his dra@@ g@@ net , because by them his life is lux@@ ur@@ ious , and his food is good .
for I , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' will be to her a wall of fire around it , and I will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
" thus has Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies spoken , saying , ' exec@@ ute true judgment , and show kin@@ d@@ ness and comp@@ as@@ sion every man to his brother .
D@@ on '@@ t op@@ press the wi@@ dow , nor the fa@@ ther@@ less , the foreig@@ ner , nor the poor ; and let none of you dev@@ ise ev@@ il against his brother in your heart . '
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neigh@@ bor . exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
and let none of you dev@@ ise ev@@ il in your hear@@ ts against his neigh@@ bor , and love no false oath : for all these are things that I h@@ ate , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
ty@@ re built her@@ self a stron@@ gh@@ old , and he@@ ap@@ ed up silver like the d@@ ust , and fine gold like the m@@ ire of the streets .
in that day Yah@@ we@@ h will defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem . he who is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h before them .
" my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be rever@@ ent toward me ; and he was rever@@ ent toward me , and stood in a@@ we of my name .
now we call the proud happy ; yes , those who work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess are built up ; yes , they temp@@ t God , and escape . '
when King Her@@ od heard it , he was troubled , and all Jer@@ usalem with him .
D@@ on '@@ t think to yo@@ ur@@ selves , ' We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham for our father , ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Ab@@ ra@@ ham from these stones .
" D@@ on '@@ t lay up treasures for yo@@ ur@@ selves on the ear@@ th , where mo@@ th and rust consum@@ e , and where th@@ i@@ ev@@ es break through and ste@@ al ;
why do you see the spec@@ k that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?
you hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite ! first remove the be@@ am out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the spec@@ k out of your brother 's eye .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
if you then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en give good things to those who ask him !
be@@ hold , they brought to him a man who was paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , lying on a bed . J@@ es@@ us , seeing their faith , said to the paral@@ y@@ tic , " Son , che@@ er up ! your sin@@ s are for@@ given you . "
but when they deliver you up , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
and be@@ hold there was a man with a with@@ ered hand . they asked him , " Is it law@@ ful to he@@ al on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day ? " that they might accuse him .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spir@@ its more ev@@ il than he is , and they enter in and d@@ well there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this ev@@ il generation . "
when evening had come , his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him , saying , " This place is de@@ ser@@ ted , and the hour is already late . send the multi@@ tu@@ des away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
immediately J@@ es@@ us made the dis@@ cip@@ les get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away .
the dis@@ cip@@ les said to him , " W@@ here should we get so many lo@@ aves in a de@@ ser@@ ted place as to satisfy so great a multi@@ tude ? "
then he comman@@ ded the dis@@ cip@@ les that they should tell no one that he was J@@ es@@ us the Ch@@ r@@ ist .
from that time , J@@ es@@ us began to show his dis@@ cip@@ les that he must go to Jer@@ usalem and suffer many things from the el@@ ders , chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
then J@@ es@@ us said to his dis@@ cip@@ les , " If anyone desi@@ res to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and for@@ fe@@ its his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
then the dis@@ cip@@ les understood that he spoke to them of John the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ zer .
but who@@ ever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to st@@ um@@ ble , it would be better for him that a huge mil@@ l@@ stone should be hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and that he should be sun@@ k in the dep@@ ths of the sea .
when he had begun to reconc@@ ile , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand tal@@ ents .
" but that ser@@ vant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred den@@ ar@@ ii , and he gra@@ bbed him , and took him by the thro@@ at , saying , ' P@@ ay me what you o@@ we ! '
for there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were born that way from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s by men ; and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en 's sake . he who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
then the mother of the sons of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e came to him with her sons , k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing and asking a certain thing of him .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
they told him , " He will mis@@ er@@ ably destroy those mis@@ er@@ able men , and will le@@ ase out the v@@ ine@@ yard to other farmers , who will give him the fruit in its season . "
when the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees heard his par@@ ables , they perceived that he spoke about them .
the sal@@ ut@@ ations in the market@@ places , and to be called ' R@@ ab@@ bi , R@@ ab@@ bi ' by men .
who@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be hum@@ b@@ led , and who@@ ever hum@@ bles himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted .
he will send out his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
but the wise answ@@ ered , saying , ' What if there is@@ n '@@ t enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yo@@ ur@@ selves . '
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but wo@@ e to that man through whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
now the chief pri@@ ests , the el@@ ders , and the whole council sought false testimony against J@@ es@@ us , that they might put him to death ;
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean lin@@ en clo@@ th ,
go quickly and tell his dis@@ cip@@ les , ' He has risen from the dead , and be@@ hold , he goes before you into Gal@@ il@@ ee ; there you will see him . ' be@@ hold , I have told you . "
J@@ es@@ us came to them and spoke to them , saying , " All authority has been given to me in heav@@ en and on ear@@ th .
he he@@ aled many who were si@@ ck with various diseases , and cast out many dem@@ ons . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow the dem@@ ons to speak , because they knew him .
if S@@ atan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he can '@@ t stand , but has an end .
and should sle@@ ep and rise night and day , and the se@@ ed should spring up and grow , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know how .
always , night and day , in the tom@@ bs and in the mountains , he was cr@@ ying out , and cutting himself with stones .
he went his way , and began to procla@@ im in Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is how J@@ es@@ us had done great things for him , and everyone mar@@ v@@ eled .
when J@@ es@@ us had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multi@@ tude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
immediately J@@ es@@ us , perce@@ i@@ ving in himself that the power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd , and asked , " Wh@@ o touched my clo@@ th@@ es ? "
he allowed no one to follow him , except Peter , James , and John the brother of James .
they ri@@ dic@@ uled him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
immediately he made his dis@@ cip@@ les get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida , while he himself sent the multi@@ tude away .
he called the multi@@ tude to himself with his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " W@@ ho@@ ever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what does it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and for@@ fe@@ it his life ?
for he was teaching his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
who@@ ever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to st@@ um@@ ble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a mil@@ l@@ stone hun@@ g around his nec@@ k .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neigh@@ bor as himself , is more important than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . "
for David himself said in the Holy Spiri@@ t , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enem@@ ies the foot@@ st@@ ool of your feet . " '
therefore David himself calls him Lord , so how can he be his son ? " the common people heard him gla@@ dly .
they began to be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and to ask him one by one , " su@@ rely not I ? " and another said , " su@@ rely not I ? "
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but wo@@ e to that man by whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
now the chief pri@@ ests and the whole council sought witnesses against J@@ es@@ us to put him to death , and found none .
the ro@@ os@@ ter cro@@ wed the second time . Peter remember@@ ed the word , how that J@@ es@@ us said to him , " Be@@ fore the ro@@ os@@ ter Cro@@ ws twice , you will deny me three times . " when he thought about that , he we@@ pt .
the multi@@ tude , cr@@ ying al@@ oud , began to ask him to do as he always did for them .
but go , tell his dis@@ cip@@ les and Peter , ' He goes before you into Gal@@ il@@ ee . there you will see him , as he said to you . ' "
after@@ ward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he re@@ bu@@ ked them for their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le . he continued making signs to them , and remained m@@ ute .
he will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High . the Lord God will give him the th@@ r@@ one of his father , David ,
his mer@@ cy is for generations of generations on those who fear him .
when they saw it , they pub@@ li@@ ciz@@ ed widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and don '@@ t begin to say among yo@@ ur@@ selves , ' We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Ab@@ ra@@ ham from these stones !
he led him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on the pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yo@@ ur@@ self down from here ,
for he was amaz@@ ed , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish which they had caught ;
but he withdrew himself into the de@@ sert , and pray@@ ed .
why do you see the spec@@ k of c@@ haf@@ f that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?
therefore I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t even think myself wor@@ thy to come to you ; but say the word , and my ser@@ vant will be he@@ aled .
now when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a pro@@ phe@@ t , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who tou@@ ches him , that she is a sin@@ ner . "
Simon answ@@ ered , " He , I sup@@ pose , to whom he for@@ gave the most . " he said to him , " You have jud@@ ged correc@@ tly . "
therefore I tell you , her sin@@ s , which are many , are for@@ given , for she lov@@ ed much . but to whom little is for@@ given , the same lov@@ es little . "
when he came to the house , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
but the multi@@ tu@@ des , perce@@ i@@ ving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cu@@ red those who needed he@@ aling .
he said to all , " If anyone desi@@ res to come after me , let him deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and los@@ es or for@@ fe@@ its his own self ?
for who@@ ever will be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he comes in his gl@@ ory , and the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
and sent mes@@ sen@@ gers before his face . they went , and entered into a village of the Samar@@ it@@ ans , so as to prepare for him .
he@@ al the si@@ ck who are there@@ in , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
if you then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather give the Holy Spiri@@ t to those who ask him ? "
then he goes , and takes seven other spir@@ its more ev@@ il than himself , and they enter in and d@@ well there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the an@@ gel@@ s of God .
when they bring you before the syn@@ ago@@ gues , the rul@@ ers , and the authorities , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
he reas@@ oned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don '@@ t have room to store my crops ? '
I will tell my sou@@ l , " Sou@@ l , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be mer@@ ry . " '
but he who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , and did things wor@@ thy of stri@@ pes , will be beaten with few stri@@ pes . to who@@ mev@@ er much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entr@@ usted , of him more will be asked .
as he said these things , all his ad@@ vers@@ aries were disappointed , and all the multi@@ tude re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the g@@ lor@@ ious things that were done by him .
for everyone who ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be hum@@ b@@ led , and who@@ ever hum@@ bles himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . "
" he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
" the manager said within himself , ' What will I do , seeing that my lor@@ d is taking away the management position from me ? I don '@@ t have strength to di@@ g . I am as@@ ha@@ med to be@@ g .
" his lor@@ d commen@@ ded the dis@@ honest manager because he had done wis@@ ely , for the children of this world are , in their own generation , wis@@ er than the children of the light .
he said to them , " You are those who justify yo@@ ur@@ selves in the sight of men , but God knows your hear@@ ts . for that which is ex@@ al@@ ted among men is an ab@@ omin@@ ation in the sight of God .
it would be better for him if a mil@@ l@@ stone were hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to st@@ um@@ ble .
won '@@ t God av@@ en@@ ge his chosen ones , who are cr@@ ying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought to lay hands on him that very hour , but they fear@@ ed the pe@@ op@@ le@@ -@@ -@@ for they knew he had spoken this par@@ able against them .
there were therefore seven brothers . the first took a wife , and died ch@@ ild@@ less .
settle it therefore in your hear@@ ts not to medi@@ t@@ ate be@@ fore@@ hand how to answer ,
they were glad , and agreed to give him money .
he said to them , " The kings of the nations lor@@ d it over them , and those who have authority over them are called ' benef@@ actors . '
they spoke many other things against him , insulting him .
they began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man per@@ ver@@ ting the nation , for@@ bidding paying taxes to Ca@@ es@@ ar , and saying that he himself is Ch@@ r@@ ist , a king . "
when he found out that he was in Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who was also in Jer@@ usalem during those days .
the people stood watching . the rul@@ ers with them also sco@@ ff@@ ed at him , saying , " He sav@@ ed others . let him save himself , if this is the Ch@@ r@@ ist of God , his chosen one ! "
one of the criminals who was han@@ ged ins@@ ulted him , saying , " If you are the Ch@@ r@@ ist , save yo@@ ur@@ self and us ! "
they said one to another , " W@@ eren '@@ t our hear@@ ts burning within us , while he spoke to us along the way , and while he opened the S@@ crip@@ tures to us ? "
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recogn@@ ized by them in the breaking of the bread .
they gave him a piece of a bro@@ iled fish and some hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
he was not the light , but was sent that he might testify about the light .
he came to his own , and those who were his own di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive him .
the next day , he saw J@@ es@@ us coming to him , and said , " be@@ hold , the lam@@ b of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
this is he of whom I said , ' After me comes a man who is preferred before me , for he was before me . '
he first found his own brother , Simon , and said to him , " We have found the Mes@@ si@@ ah ! " ( which is , being interpreted , Ch@@ r@@ ist ) .
J@@ es@@ us saw N@@ athan@@ a@@ el coming to him , and said about him , " be@@ hold , an Isra@@ elite indeed , in whom is no dec@@ e@@ it ! "
but he spoke of the temp@@ le of his body .
and because he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t need for anyone to testify concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
John answ@@ ered , " A man can receive nothing , unless it has been given him from heav@@ en .
are you greater than our father , Jac@@ o@@ b , who gave us the well , and d@@ rank of it himself , as did his children , and his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck ? "
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true wor@@ ship@@ pers will worship the F@@ ather in spirit and truth , for the F@@ ather seeks such to be his wor@@ ship@@ pers .
for J@@ es@@ us himself testified that a pro@@ phe@@ t has no hon@@ or in his own country .
so the father knew that it was at that hour in which J@@ es@@ us said to him , " Y@@ our son lives . " he believed , as did his whole house .
the man went away , and told the Jews that it was J@@ es@@ us who had made him well .
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sab@@ b@@ ath , but also called God his own F@@ ather , making himself equal with God .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righ@@ te@@ ous ; because I don '@@ t seek my own will , but the will of my F@@ ather who sent me .
" if I testify about myself , my witness is not valid .
J@@ es@@ us therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multi@@ tude was coming to him , said to Philip , " W@@ here are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
this he said to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
it is written in the pro@@ ph@@ ets , ' They will all be ta@@ ught by God . ' therefore everyone who he@@ ars from the F@@ ather , and has learned , comes to me .
for no one does anything in secret , and himself seeks to be known openly . if you do these things , reveal yo@@ ur@@ self to the world . "
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own gl@@ ory , but he who seeks the gl@@ ory of him who sent him is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
but he said this about the Spiri@@ t , which those believ@@ ing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spiri@@ t was not yet given , because J@@ es@@ us was@@ n '@@ t yet gl@@ ori@@ fied .
I am one who testi@@ fies about myself , and the F@@ ather who sent me testi@@ fies about me . "
the Jews therefore said , " Will he kill himself , that he says , ' W@@ here I am going , you can '@@ t come ? ' "
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand that he spoke to them about the F@@ ather .
are you greater than our father , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who died ? the pro@@ ph@@ ets died . who do you make yo@@ ur@@ self out to be ? "
his dis@@ cip@@ les asked him , " R@@ ab@@ bi , who sin@@ ned , this man or his parents , that he was born b@@ lin@@ d ? "
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , " Ne@@ ither did this man sin , nor his parents ; but , that the works of God might be revealed in him .
but how he now sees , we don '@@ t know ; or who opened his eyes , we don '@@ t know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
we know that God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to sin@@ ners , but if anyone is a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and does his will , he list@@ ens to him .
he answ@@ ered , " Wh@@ o is he , Lord , that I may believe in him ? "
if he called them go@@ ds , to whom the word of God came ( and the S@@ crip@@ ture can '@@ t be broken ) ,
so they made him a Sup@@ per there . Mar@@ th@@ a served , but Lazar@@ us was one of those who sat at the table with him .
for I spoke not from myself , but the F@@ ather who sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over , J@@ es@@ us , kno@@ wing that his time had come that he would de@@ part from this world to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own who were in the world , he lov@@ ed them to the end .
J@@ es@@ us , kno@@ wing that the F@@ ather had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and was going to God ,
for he knew him who would bet@@ ray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
by this everyone will know that you are my dis@@ cip@@ les , if you have love for one another . "
one who has my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keeps them , that person is one who lov@@ es me . one who lov@@ es me will be lov@@ ed by my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Ju@@ das ( not Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yo@@ ur@@ self to us , and not to the world ? "
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world ha@@ tes you .
therefore you now have sor@@ row , but I will see you again , and your heart will re@@ jo@@ ice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
for the F@@ ather himself lov@@ es you , because you have lov@@ ed me , and have believed that I came forth from God .
for their sak@@ es I sanc@@ ti@@ fy myself , that they themselves also may be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in truth .
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , " O@@ f those whom you have given me , I have lost none . "
they led J@@ es@@ us therefore from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um . it was early , and they themselves di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um , that they might not be def@@ iled , but might eat the P@@ ass@@ over .
the Jews answ@@ ered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
how do we hear , everyone in our own native language ?
therefore , being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up the Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ,
for David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t as@@ cen@@ d into the heav@@ ens , but he says himself , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit by my right hand ,
now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the A@@ post@@ les , " Brothers , what shall we do ? "
with many other words he testified , and ex@@ hor@@ ted them , saying , " S@@ ave yo@@ ur@@ selves from this cro@@ oked generation ! "
they continued stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in the A@@ post@@ les ' teaching and fel@@ low@@ ship , in the breaking of bread , and pray@@ er .
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heav@@ en , the ear@@ th , the sea , and all that is in them ;
but we will continue stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in pray@@ er and in the ministry of the word . "
Jac@@ o@@ b went down into Egypt , and he died , himself and our fa@@ thers ,
Simon himself also believed . being b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , he continued with Philip . seeing signs and great mir@@ ac@@ les oc@@ curr@@ ing , he was amaz@@ ed .
the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch answ@@ ered Philip , " Wh@@ o is the pro@@ phe@@ t talking about ? about himself , or about someone else ? "
but Philip was found at Az@@ o@@ tus . passing through , he pre@@ ached the Go@@ od News to all the cities , until he came to Ca@@ es@@ area .
he fell on the ear@@ th , and heard a voice saying to him , " Sa@@ ul , Sa@@ ul , why do you persec@@ ute me ? "
a dev@@ out man , and one who fear@@ ed God with all his house , who gave gifts for the ne@@ edy gener@@ ously to the people , and always pray@@ ed to God .
having explained everything to them , he sent them to J@@ op@@ pa .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and d@@ rank with him after he rose from the dead .
as they served the Lord and fas@@ ted , the Holy Spiri@@ t said , " separate Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Sa@@ ul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Gal@@ il@@ ee to Jer@@ usalem , who are his witnesses to the people .
yet he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you ra@@ ins from the sky and fruit@@ ful se@@ as@@ ons , filling our hear@@ ts with food and gla@@ d@@ ness . "
even saying these things , they hardly stopped the multi@@ tu@@ des from making a sacrifice to them .
when they had come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received by the assembly and the A@@ post@@ les and the el@@ ders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
all the multi@@ tude kept sil@@ ence , and they list@@ ened to Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Paul reporting what signs and won@@ ders God had done among the nations through them .
Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations , to take out of them a people for his name .
Ju@@ das and Sil@@ as , also being pro@@ ph@@ ets themselves , encouraged the brothers with many words , and strengthened them .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he took them the same hour of the night , and was@@ hed their stri@@ pes , and was immediately b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , he and all his household .
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
but when Sil@@ as and Tim@@ o@@ thy came down from Macedonia , Paul was comp@@ elled by the Spiri@@ t , testi@@ fying to the Jews that J@@ es@@ us was the Ch@@ r@@ ist .
he came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and reas@@ oned with the Jews .
Paul said , " John indeed b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism of rep@@ ent@@ ance , saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him , that is , in J@@ es@@ us . "
having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him , Tim@@ o@@ thy and Er@@ as@@ tus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
but when they perceived that he was a J@@ ew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cri@@ ed out , " Great is Ar@@ tem@@ is of the E@@ ph@@ es@@ ians ! "
after the u@@ pro@@ ar had ce@@ ased , Paul sent for the dis@@ cip@@ les , took leave of them , and depar@@ ted to go into Macedonia .
when he had spent three months there , and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sa@@ il for Syria , he determined to return through Macedonia .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sa@@ il for As@@ sos , inten@@ ding to take Paul abo@@ ard there , for he had so arran@@ ged , inten@@ ding himself to go by land .
therefore watch , remember@@ ing that for a period of three years I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ce@@ ase to ad@@ mon@@ ish everyone night and day with te@@ ars .
when they had tied him up with th@@ on@@ gs , Paul asked the centur@@ ion who stood by , " Is it law@@ ful for you to s@@ cour@@ ge a man who is a Roman , and not found guilty ? "
immediately those who were about to examine him depar@@ ted from him , and the comman@@ ding officer also was afraid when he real@@ ized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and res@@ cu@@ ed him , having learned that he was a Roman .
desi@@ ring to know the cause why they accused him , I brought him down to their council .
so the soldiers , carrying out their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Anti@@ patri@@ s .
he ordered the centur@@ ion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to for@@ bid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a ser@@ vant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
therefore you are without exc@@ use , O man , who@@ ever you are who judge . for in that which you judge another , you condemn yo@@ ur@@ self . for you who judge practice the same things .
but according to your hard@@ ness and un@@ rep@@ ent@@ ant heart you are treas@@ uring up for yo@@ ur@@ self wr@@ ath in the day of wr@@ ath , reve@@ lation , and of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God ;
indeed you bear the name of a J@@ ew , and rest on the law , and gl@@ ory in God ,
you therefore who te@@ ach another , don '@@ t you te@@ ach yo@@ ur@@ self ? you who pre@@ ach that a man sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t ste@@ al , do you ste@@ al ?
not only so , but we also re@@ jo@@ ice in God through our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , through whom we have now received the reconciliation .
neither present your members to sin as instruments of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but present yo@@ ur@@ selves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness to God .
the Spiri@@ t himself testi@@ fies with our spirit that we are children of God ;
in the same way , the Spiri@@ t also helps our weaknesses , for we don '@@ t know how to pra@@ y as we ought . but the Spiri@@ t himself makes inter@@ c@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can '@@ t be ut@@ tered .
but indeed , O man , who are you to rep@@ ly against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Wh@@ y did you make me like this ? "
" it will be that in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' There they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
for there is no distinc@@ tion between J@@ ew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mer@@ cies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , hol@@ y , acceptable to God , which is your spir@@ itual service .
in love of the brothers be ten@@ derly aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ate one to another ; in hon@@ or prefer@@ ring one another ;
re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing in hope ; en@@ during in troub@@ les ; continuing stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in pray@@ er ;
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
I myself am also persu@@ aded about you , my brothers , that you yo@@ ur@@ selves are full of Go@@ od@@ ness , filled with all knowledge , able also to ad@@ mon@@ ish others .
yes , it has been their good pleas@@ ure , and they are their deb@@ tors . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , they o@@ we it to them also to serve them in fle@@ sh@@ ly things .
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way wor@@ thy of the sa@@ ints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she her@@ self also has been a hel@@ per of many , and of my own self .
gre@@ et one another with a hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s . the assemb@@ lies of Ch@@ r@@ ist gre@@ et you .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence has become known to all . I re@@ jo@@ ice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is ev@@ il .
I than@@ k God that I b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed none of you , except Cris@@ p@@ us and G@@ ai@@ us ,
let no one dec@@ e@@ ive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fo@@ ol , that he may become wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
or don '@@ t you know that your body is a temp@@ le of the Holy Spiri@@ t which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
the wife do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over his own body , but the wife .
D@@ on '@@ t de@@ pri@@ ve one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er , and may be together again , that S@@ atan do@@ es@@ n '@@ t temp@@ t you because of your lack of self @@@ -@@ @ control .
but I say to the un@@ married and to wi@@ dows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am .
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemb@@ lies .
my defen@@ se to those who examine me is this .
to the Jews I became as a J@@ ew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ;
every man who stri@@ ves in the games exercises self @@@ -@@ @ control in all things . now they do it to receive a cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble cro@@ wn , but we an incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble .
for if we dis@@ cer@@ ned ourselves , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be jud@@ ged .
he who speaks in another language edi@@ fies himself , but he who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies edi@@ fies the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him recogn@@ ize the things which I write to you , that they are the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
but if anyone is ignor@@ ant , let him be ignor@@ ant .
when all things have been subj@@ ected to him , then the Son will also himself be subj@@ ected to him who subj@@ ected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
why do we also stand in jeop@@ ard@@ y every hour ?
all the brothers gre@@ et you . gre@@ et one another with a hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s .
are we beginning again to commen@@ d ourselves ? or do we need , as do some , letters of commen@@ dation to you or from you ?
but we have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of sh@@ ame , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by the manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
for we don '@@ t pre@@ ach ourselves , but Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for J@@ es@@ us ' sake ;
for we are not commen@@ ding ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of bo@@ asting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who bo@@ ast in appearance , and not in heart .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their sak@@ es died and rose again .
his aff@@ ection is more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly toward you , while he re@@ members all of your obe@@ di@@ ence , how with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling you received him .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone tru@@ sts in himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , so also we are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
for we are not b@@ old to number or compar@@ e ourselves with some of those who commen@@ d themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
for such men are false A@@ post@@ les , dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful workers , mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ading as Ch@@ r@@ ist 's A@@ post@@ les .
and no wonder , for even S@@ atan mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ades as an an@@ gel of light .
it is no great thing therefore if his servants also mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ade as servants of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , whose end will be according to their works .
I will most gla@@ dly spend and be spent for your so@@ ul@@ s . if I love you more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , am I lov@@ ed the less ?
gre@@ et one another with a hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s .
the S@@ crip@@ ture , fore@@ seeing that God would justify the Gen@@ ti@@ les by faith , pre@@ ached the Go@@ od News be@@ fore@@ hand to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , " In you all the nations will be b@@ les@@ sed . "
they z@@ e@@ al@@ ously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to ali@@ en@@ ate you , that you may seek them .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he dec@@ e@@ ives himself .
but let him who is ta@@ ught in the word share all good things with him who teach@@ es .
for even they who receive circum@@ c@@ ision don '@@ t keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may bo@@ ast in your f@@ les@@ h .
who having become cal@@ l@@ ous gave themselves up to l@@ ust , to work all un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess with gre@@ ed@@ iness .
and be kind to one another , ten@@ der@@ hear@@ ted , for@@ giving each other , just as God also in Ch@@ r@@ ist for@@ gave you .
walk in love , even as Ch@@ r@@ ist also lov@@ ed you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a swe@@ et @@@ -@@ @ s@@ mel@@ ling fra@@ gr@@ ance .
subj@@ ecting yo@@ ur@@ selves one to another in the fear of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
hus@@ bands , love your wi@@ ves , even as Ch@@ r@@ ist also lov@@ ed the assembly , and gave himself up for it ;
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
stand therefore , having the utility bel@@ t of truth bu@@ ck@@ led around your wa@@ ist , and having put on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ,
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts .
grace be with all those who love our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist with incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble love . A@@ men .
doing nothing through ri@@ val@@ ry or through conce@@ it , but in hum@@ il@@ ity , each counting others better than himself ;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleas@@ ure .
I have sent him therefore the more dil@@ ig@@ ently , that , when you see him again , you may re@@ jo@@ ice , and that I may be the less sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful .
who will change the body of our hum@@ iliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his gl@@ ory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
bearing with one another , and for@@ giving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Ch@@ r@@ ist for@@ gave you , so you also do .
continue stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in pray@@ er , watching there@@ in with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving ;
I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts ,
as you know , we ex@@ hor@@ ted , comfor@@ ted , and imp@@ lo@@ red every one of you , as a father does his own children ,
now may our God and F@@ ather himself , and our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , direct our way to you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and ab@@ ound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
that each one of you know how to poss@@ ess himself of his own ves@@ sel in sanc@@ ti@@ fication and hon@@ or ,
but concerning bro@@ ther@@ ly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yo@@ ur@@ selves are ta@@ ught by God to love one another ,
and that you make it your ambi@@ tion to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instruc@@ ted you ;
for the Lord himself will des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with God 's tr@@ ump@@ et . the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist will rise first ,
therefore comfor@@ t one another with these words .
May the God of peace himself sanc@@ ti@@ fy you completely . May your whole spirit , sou@@ l , and body be preserved bla@@ me@@ less at the coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in la@@ bor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
now those who are that way , we command and ex@@ h@@ ort in the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that with qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness they work , and eat their own bread .
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
the gre@@ et@@ ing of me , Paul , with my own hand , which is the sign in every letter : this is how I write .
for those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing , and great bol@@ d@@ ness in the faith which is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
but refuse prof@@ ane and old wi@@ ves ' f@@ ables . exercise yo@@ ur@@ self toward go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess .
until I come , pay attention to reading , to ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation , and to teaching .
be dil@@ ig@@ ent in these things . give yo@@ ur@@ self wh@@ ol@@ ly to them , that your progress may be revealed to all .
pay attention to yo@@ ur@@ self , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yo@@ ur@@ self and those who hear you .
but she who gives her@@ self to pleas@@ ure is dead while she lives .
lay hands has@@ ti@@ ly on no one , neither be a particip@@ ant in other men 's sin@@ s . keep yo@@ ur@@ self p@@ ure .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of ev@@ il . some have been led as@@ tra@@ y from the faith in their gre@@ ed , and have pi@@ er@@ ced themselves through with many sor@@ ro@@ ws .
lay@@ ing up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold of eter@@ nal life .
no soldier on duty ent@@ ang@@ les himself in the affairs of life , that he may ple@@ ase him who enrol@@ led him as a soldier .
give dil@@ ig@@ ence to present yo@@ ur@@ self approved by God , a work@@ man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t need to be as@@ ha@@ med , properly handling the Wor@@ d of Tru@@ th .
if anyone therefore pur@@ ges himself from these , he will be a ves@@ sel for hon@@ or , sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and su@@ itable for the master 's use , prepared for every good work .
in g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess correc@@ ting those who oppose him : perhaps God may give them rep@@ ent@@ ance leading to a full knowledge of the truth ,
who gave himself for us , that he might re@@ de@@ em us from all in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and pur@@ ify for himself a people for his own possession , z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for good works .
kno@@ wing that such a one is per@@ ver@@ ted , and sin@@ s , being self @@@ -@@ @ condemned .
let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they may not be un@@ fruit@@ ful .
I am sending him back . therefore receive him , that is , my own heart ,
if then you count me a partner , receive him as you would receive me .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you o@@ we to me even your own self besides ) .
E@@ pap@@ h@@ ras , my fellow prison@@ er in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , gre@@ ets you ,
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to gl@@ ory , to make the author of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
but ex@@ h@@ ort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today " ; lest any one of you be har@@ dened by the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of sin .
to whom did he swe@@ ar that they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into his rest , but to those who were dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent ?
for indeed we have had good news pre@@ ached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard di@@ d@@ n '@@ t profit them , because it was@@ n '@@ t mixed with faith by those who heard .
there is no cre@@ ature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are nak@@ ed and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
the high pri@@ est can deal g@@ ently with those who are ignor@@ ant and going as@@ tra@@ y , because he himself is also surrounded with weak@@ ness .
because of this , he must offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for sin@@ s for the people , as well as for himself .
nobody takes this hon@@ or on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
so also Ch@@ r@@ ist di@@ d@@ n '@@ t g@@ lor@@ ify himself to be made a high pri@@ est , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his f@@ les@@ h , having offered up pray@@ ers and peti@@ tions with strong cr@@ ying and te@@ ars to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his go@@ dly fear ,
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous , so as to forget your work and the la@@ bor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the sa@@ ints , and still do serve them .
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tri@@ be , from which no one has offici@@ ated at the alt@@ ar .
( for they indeed have been made pri@@ ests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord s@@ wor@@ e and will not change his mind , ' You are a pri@@ est fore@@ ver , according to the order of Mel@@ chi@@ zede@@ k . ' "
but into the second the high pri@@ est alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the err@@ ors of the people .
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high pri@@ est enters into the hol@@ y place year by year with blood not his own ,
without faith it is impossible to be well ple@@ asing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , even Sar@@ ah her@@ self received power to conce@@ ive , and she b@@ ore a child when she was past age , since she counted him fa@@ ith@@ ful who had promised .
let no man say when he is temp@@ ted , " I am temp@@ ted by God , " for God can '@@ t be temp@@ ted by ev@@ il , and he himself temp@@ ts no one .
for if anyone is a hear@@ er of the word and not a do@@ er , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mir@@ ror ;
p@@ ure religion and un@@ def@@ iled before our God and F@@ ather is this : to visit the fa@@ ther@@ less and wi@@ dows in their aff@@ li@@ ction , and to keep on@@ es@@ el@@ f un@@ st@@ ained by the world .
listen , my bel@@ ov@@ ed brothers . D@@ id@@ n '@@ t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
you ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , don '@@ t you know that friendship with the world is en@@ mity with God ? who@@ ever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
you have lived de@@ lic@@ ately on the ear@@ th , and taken your pleas@@ ure . you have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
D@@ on '@@ t gr@@ um@@ ble , brothers , against one another , so that you won '@@ t be jud@@ ged . be@@ hold , the judge stands at the door .
finally , be all like @@@ -@@ @ min@@ ded , comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate , lov@@ ing as brothers , ten@@ der@@ hear@@ ted , cour@@ te@@ ous ,
they think it is st@@ range that you don '@@ t run with them into the same exc@@ ess of riot , b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ing :
and above all things be ear@@ n@@ est in your love among yo@@ ur@@ selves , for love covers a multi@@ tude of sin@@ s .
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the el@@ der . yes , all of you clo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves with hum@@ il@@ ity , to subject yo@@ ur@@ selves to one another ; for " God res@@ ists the proud , but gives grace to the hum@@ ble . "
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
therefore , brothers , be more dil@@ ig@@ ent to make your calling and election sure . for if you do these things , you will never st@@ um@@ ble .
promising them liber@@ ty , while they themselves are bon@@ d@@ servants of corruption ; for a man is brought into bon@@ da@@ ge by who@@ ever over@@ comes him .
everyone who has this hope set on him pur@@ i@@ fies himself , even as he is p@@ ure .
little children , keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from id@@ ols .
Demetri@@ us has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
but you , bel@@ ov@@ ed , keep building up yo@@ ur@@ selves on your most hol@@ y faith , pray@@ ing in the Holy Spiri@@ t .
I will kill her children with De@@ ath , and all the assemb@@ lies will know that I am he who sear@@ ches the min@@ ds and hear@@ ts . I will give to each one of you according to your de@@ eds .
and be@@ hold , a white hor@@ se , and he who sat on it had a bo@@ w . a cro@@ wn was given to him , and he came forth conqu@@ ering , and to conqu@@ er .
a long white ro@@ be was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
it was given to him to give bre@@ ath to it , to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause as many as wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the be@@ ast to be killed .
I saw , and be@@ hold , the lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his F@@ ather , written on their fore@@ heads .
the be@@ ast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes to destruction .
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
his eyes are a fla@@ me of fire , and on his head are many crow@@ ns . he has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself .
