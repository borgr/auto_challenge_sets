now the earth was formless and empty . darkness was on the surface of the deep . God 's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters .
God made the expanse , and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse ; and it was so .
the earth yielded grass , herbs yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its seed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " behold , I have given you every herb yielding seed , which is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree , which bears fruit yielding seed . it will be your food .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens .
but a mist went up from the earth , and watered the whole surface of the ground .
a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from there it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is Pishon : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
the name of the second river is Gihon : the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush .
the name of the third river is Hiddekel : this is the one which flows in front of Assyria . the fourth river is the Euphrates .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
the man gave names to all livestock , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him .
Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the rib , which Yahweh God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
so he drove out the man ; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden , and the flame of a sword which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
again she gave birth , to Cain 's brother Abel . Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don 't do well , sin crouches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
now you are Cursed because of the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won 't yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth . "
to Enoch was born Irad . Irad became the father of Mehujael . Mehujael became the father of Methushael . Methushael became the father of Lamech .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's likeness .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own likeness , after his image , and named him Seth .
it happened , when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground , and daughters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's daughters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose .
Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
this is the history of the generations of Noah . Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time . Noah walked with God .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this earth , to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the earth will die .
but I will establish my Covenant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wives with you .
of every living thing of all flesh , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
Noah went into the ship with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wives , because of the waters of the flood .
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
God remembered Noah , all the animals , and all the livestock that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the earth . the waters subsided .
the deep 's fountains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was restrained .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on Ararat 's mountains .
the waters receded continually until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
the dove came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
Noah built an altar to Yahweh , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
I set my rainbow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a Covenant between me and the earth .
Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they didn 't see their father 's nakedness .
Canaan became the father of Sidon ( his firstborn ) , Heth ,
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as you go toward Gerar , to Gaza ; as you go toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , to Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to Shem , the father of all the children of Eber , the elder brother of Japheth , to him also were children born .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
it happened , as they traveled east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and they lived there .
Yahweh said , " behold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be withheld from them , which they intend to do .
so Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Babel , because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth . from there , Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
this is the history of the generations of Shem . Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood .
now this is the history of the generations of Terah . Terah became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran . Haran became the father of lot .
Abram and Nahor took wives . the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah .
now Yahweh said to Abram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will bless those who bless you , and I will curse him who curses you . all of the families of the earth will be blessed in you . "
there was a famine in the land . Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyptians will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Abram called on the name of Yahweh .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their substance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's livestock and the herdsmen of lot 's livestock : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time .
Yahweh said to Abram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , northward and southward and eastward and westward ,
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its breadth ; for I will give it to you . "
it happened in the days of Amraphel , king of Shinar , Arioch , king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer , king of Elam , and tidal , king of Goiim ,
that they made war with Bera , king of Sodom , and with Birsha , king of Gomorrah , Shinab , king of Admah , and Shemeber , king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ) .
they returned , and came to En Mishpat ( the same is Kadesh ) , and struck all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that lived in Hazazon Tamar .
now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hills .
when Abram heard that his relative was taken captive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursued them to Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand . " Abram gave him a tenth of all .
Abram said , " behold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Yahweh came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he didn 't divide the birds .
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian , her handmaid , after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife .
the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
the angel of Yahweh said to her , " I will greatly multiply your seed , that they will not be numbered for multitude . "
neither will your name any more be called Abram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will establish my Covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God to you and to your seed after you .
this is my Covenant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your seed after you . every male among you shall be circumcised .
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin . it will be a token of the Covenant between me and you .
the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my Covenant . "
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
but he lingered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Yahweh being merciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's seed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she arose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he didn 't know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ear . the men were very scared .
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
he lived in the wilderness of Paran . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
so they made a Covenant at Beersheba . Abimelech rose up with Phicol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
and said , " I have sworn by myself , says Yahweh , because you have done this thing , and have not withheld your son , your only son ,
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the seashore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
Abraham rose up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth . Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) , in the land of Canaan .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth .
I will make you swear by Yahweh , the God of heaven and the God of the earth , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I live .
the servant took ten camels , of his master 's camels , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
behold , I am standing by the spring of water . the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pitcher , and came up .
it happened , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ,
he said to me , ' Yahweh , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don 't give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
and she will tell me , " Drink , and I will also draw for your camels , " --let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master 's son . '
she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , ' Drink , and I will also give your camels a drink . ' so I drank , and she also gave the camels a drink .
behold , Rebekah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yahweh has spoken . "
the servant brought out jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Rebekah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
they blessed Rebekah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them . "
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were camels coming .
but to the sons of Abraham 's concubines , Abraham gave gifts . he sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , to the east country .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and Ishmael , his sons , buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ,
now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bore to Abraham .
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of Ishmael : one hundred thirty @-@ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian , to be his wife .
there was a famine in the land , besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines , to Gerar .
I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your seed all these lands . in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed ,
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
when Esau was forty years old , he took as wife Judith , the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
now therefore , please take your weapons , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison .
make me savory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them savory food for your father , such as he loves .
he went , and got them , and brought them to his mother . his mother made savory food , such as his father loved .
Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau . "
let peoples serve you , and nations bow down to you . be lord over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bow down to you . Cursed be everyone who curses you . blessed be everyone who blesses you . "
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " bless me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac his father answered him , " behold , of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck . "
Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
he dreamed . behold , a stairway set upon the earth , and its top reached to heaven . behold , the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Bethel , but the name of the city was Luz at the first .
Jacob vowed a vow , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pillar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you . "
Jacob said to Laban , " Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
when Leah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zilpah , her handmaid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
she conceived , bore a son , and said , " God has taken away my reproach . "
it happened , when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering @-@ troughs where the flocks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban : and he put his own droves apart , and didn 't put them into Laban 's flock .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were feeble , he didn 't put them in . so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
Jacob saw the expression on Laban 's face , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
if he said this , ' The speckled will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore speckled . if he said this , ' The streaked will be your wages , ' then all the flock bore streaked .
it happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked , speckled , and grizzled .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked , speckled , and grizzled , for I have seen all that Laban does to you .
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian , in that he didn 't tell him that he was running away .
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly longed for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my gods ? "
Laban went into Jacob 's tent , into Leah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he didn 't find them . he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the teraphim , put them in the Camel 's saddle , and sat on them . Laban felt about all the tent , but didn 't find them .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven 't eaten the rams of your flocks .
now come , let us make a Covenant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
if you afflict my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , no man is with us ; behold , God is witness between me and you . "
May this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jacob swore by the fear of his father , Isaac .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them . Laban departed and returned to his place .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , the field of Edom .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks , and the herds , and the camels , into two companies ;
you said , ' I will surely do you good , and make your seed as the sand of the sea , which can 't be numbered because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded the foremost , saying , " When Esau , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your servant , Jacob 's . it is a present sent to my lord , Esau . behold , he also is behind us . ' "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Esau , when you find him .
when he saw that he didn 't prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was strained , as he wrestled .
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
therefore the children of Israel don 't eat the sinew of the hip , which is on the hollow of the thigh , to this day , because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew of the hip .
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Leah , Rachel , and the two handmaids .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Who are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has graciously given your servant . "
Leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan Aram ; and encamped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Dinah , the daughter of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his livestock in the field . Jacob held his peace until they came .
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
but if you will not listen to us , to be circumcised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man didn 't wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
Hamor and Shechem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circumcised , as they are circumcised .
they killed Hamor and Shechem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went away .
they took their flocks , their herds , their donkeys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took captive all their little ones and their wives , and took as plunder everything that was in the house .
God said to Jacob , " arise , go up to Bethel , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " Put away the foreign gods that are among you , purify yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Bethel . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands , and the rings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
so Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an altar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
the sons of Zilpah ( Leah 's handmaid ) : Gad and Asher . these are the sons of Jacob , who were born to him in Paddan Aram .
Isaac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . Esau and Jacob , his sons , buried him .
now this is the history of the generations of Esau ( that is , Edom ) .
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon , the Hittite ; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , the Hivite ;
Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jalam , and Korah . these are the sons of Esau , who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together , and the land of their travels couldn 't bear them because of their livestock .
this is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir :
these are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah , the wife of Esau ; and Reuel , the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
these were the sons of Oholibamah , the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : she bore to Esau Jeush , Jalam , and Korah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau : chief Teman , chief Omar , chief Zepho , chief Kenaz ,
these are the sons of Oholibamah , Esau 's wife : chief Jeush , chief Jalam , chief Korah : these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
Dishon , Ezer , and Dishan . these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
chief Dishon , chief Ezer , and chief Dishan : these are the chiefs who came of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
Husham died , and Hadad , the son of Bedad , who struck Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . the name of his city was Avith .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Timna , chief Alvah , chief Jetheth ,
chief Magdiel , and chief Iram . these are the chiefs of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession . this is Esau , the father of the Edomites .
for behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and behold , my sheaf arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your sheaves came around , and bowed down to my sheaf . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dominion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has devoured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
Reuben returned to the pit ; and saw that Joseph wasn 't in the pit ; and he tore his clothes .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
it happened at that time , that Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
Judah said to Onan , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he didn 't concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @-@ built and handsome .
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mock me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kindled .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yahweh was with Joseph , and showed kindness to him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dreamed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the cupbearer and the Baker of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , the way you did when you were his cupbearer .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon . "
within three more days , Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you , and will hang you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief Baker among his servants .
behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , sleek and fat , and they fed in the marsh grass .
behold , seven other cattle came up after them out of the river , ugly and thin , and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's magicians and wise men . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . he shaved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Pharaoh .
and behold , seven other cattle came up after them , poor and very ugly and thin , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness .
and behold , seven heads of grain , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh .
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows ; for it will be very grievous .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint overseers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plenteous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Pharaoh said to Joseph , " behold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
but Jacob didn 't send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " Lest perhaps harm happen to him . "
by this you shall be tested . by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
Reuben answered them , saying , " Didn 't I tell you , saying , ' Don 't sin against the child , ' and you wouldn 't listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
they came to Jacob their father , to the land of Canaan , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
it happened as they emptied their sacks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were afraid .
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet . he gave their donkeys fodder .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don 't eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination to the Egyptians .
they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men marveled one with another .
put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , with his grain money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
we said to my lord , ' The boy can 't leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can 't go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " surely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven 't seen him since .
for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don 't bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father forever . '
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bondservant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy isn 't with me ? --lest I see the evil that will come on my father . "
then Joseph couldn 't control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " Cause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don 't wait .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
the report of it was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
he sent the following to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they departed . he said to them , " See that you don 't quarrel on the way . "
Jacob rose up from Beersheba , and the sons of Israel carried Jacob , their father , their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
they took their livestock , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt--Jacob , and all his seed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to Rachel , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob : all the souls were seven .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
he sent Judah before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Goshen , and they came into the land of Goshen .
these men are shepherds , for they have been keepers of livestock , and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have . '
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone didn 't become Pharaoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @-@ seven years .
but when I sleep with my fathers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their burying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh , even as Reuben and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he couldn 't see . he brought them near to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow . "
boiling over as water , you shall not excel ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then defiled it . he went up to my couch .
my soul , don 't come into their council . my glory , don 't be united to their assembly ; for in their anger they killed men . in their self @-@ will they hamstrung cattle .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
" Judah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
the scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obedience of the peoples be .
binding his foal to the vine , his donkey 's colt to the choice vine ; he has washed his garments in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
" Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea . he will be for a haven of ships . his border will be on Sidon .
but his bow remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob , ( from there is the shepherd , the stone of Israel ) ,
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them . he blessed everyone according to his blessing .
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation . he mourned for his father seven days .
as for you , you meant evil against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
Joseph saw Ephraim 's children to the third generation . the children also of Machir , the son of Manasseh , were born on Joseph 's knees .
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew Midwives , of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah ,
when she could no longer hide him , she took a papyrus basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the reeds by the river 's bank .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and lived in the land of Midian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up to God because of the bondage .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to Pharaoh , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Moses said to God , " Who am I , that I should go to Pharaoh , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @-@ handed .
he said , " Put your hand inside your cloak again . " he put his hand inside his cloak again , and when he took it out of his cloak , behold , it had turned again as his other flesh .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
he said , " Oh , Lord , please send someone else . "
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a donkey , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshiped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Pharaoh , " This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
let heavier work be laid on the men , that they may labor therein ; and don 't let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what Pharaoh says : ' I will not give you straw .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven 't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks ! "
I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage , and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fathers ' houses . the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel : Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari ; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty @-@ seven years .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel ; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty @-@ three years .
Amram took Jochebed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty @-@ seven years .
Eleazar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife ; and she bore him Phinehas . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Yahweh said , " Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
it happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but Pharaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers . they also , the magicians of Egypt , did the same thing with their enchantments .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river . " ' "
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians couldn 't drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments ; and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , and he didn 't listen to them ; as Yahweh had spoken .
Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and he didn 't even take this to heart .
and the frogs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , over the streams , and over the pools , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
the frogs shall depart from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite , he hardened his heart , and didn 't listen to them , as Yahweh had spoken .
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
behold , the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the donkeys , on the camels , on the herds , and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence .
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yahweh did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead . but the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , and he didn 't let the people go .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal .
for this time I will send all my plagues against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pestilence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth ;
those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses .
Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens , and Yahweh sent Thunder , hail , and lightning flashed down to the earth . Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Go in to Pharaoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country ,
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh . "
the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very grievous . before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the locusts , and drove them into the Red Sea . there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
they didn 't see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
Yahweh said to Moses , " Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will surely thrust you out altogether .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old . you shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the flesh in that night , roasted with fire , and unleavened bread . they shall eat it with bitter herbs .
Don 't eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roasted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in haste : it is Yahweh 's Passover .
you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron , so they did .
Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , " Rise up , get out from among my people , both you and the children of Israel ; and go , serve Yahweh , as you have said !
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in haste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and clothing .
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it wasn 't leavened , because they were thrust out of Egypt , and couldn 't wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yahweh , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
but every man 's servant who is bought for money , when you have circumcised him , then shall he eat of it .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days ; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall yeast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
" it shall be , when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite , as he swore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb , and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Yahweh 's .
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when Pharaoh drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians were marching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cried out to Yahweh .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen , even all Pharaoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh , and said , " I will sing to Yahweh , for he has triumphed gloriously . the horse and his Rider he has thrown into the sea .
Yah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
in the greatness of your excellency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stubble .
with the blast of your nostrils , the waters were piled up . the floods stood upright as a heap . the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will overtake . I will divide the spoil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them . '
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have redeemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation .
then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed . Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab . all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away .
terror and dread falls on them . by the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over , Yahweh , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a tambourine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances .
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud .
it happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the Frost on the ground .
when they measured it with an Omer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they didn 't listen to Moses , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and became foul : and Moses was angry with them .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one , and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it didn 't become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
behold , because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
all the Congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of sin , by their journeys , according to Yahweh 's commandment , and encamped in Rephidim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
the people were thirsty for water there ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
Yahweh said to Moses , " Walk on before the people , and take the elders of Israel with you , and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile , and go .
so Joshua did as Moses had told him , and fought with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
Moses went out to meet his father @-@ in @-@ law , and bowed and kissed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @-@ in @-@ law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Yahweh delivered them .
Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro , Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God . Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father @-@ in @-@ law before God .
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
you shall teach them the statutes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
so Moses listened to the voice of his father @-@ in @-@ law , and did all that he had said .
Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
when they had departed from Rephidim , and had come to the wilderness of Sinai , they encamped in the wilderness ; and there Israel encamped before the mountain .
Moses went up to God , and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my Covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don 't go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
Yahweh said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don 't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh , lest he break forth on them . "
" you shall not make for yourselves an idol , nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
all the people perceived the thunderings , the lightnings , the sound of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trembled , and stayed at a distance .
Yahweh said to Moses , " This is what you shall tell the children of Israel : ' you yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
if you make me an altar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have polluted it .

" if a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod , and he dies under his hand , he shall surely be punished .
" if a man strikes his servant 's eye , or his maid 's eye , and destroys it , he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if he strikes out his male servant 's tooth , or his female servant 's tooth , he shall let him go free for his tooth 's sake .
" if a bull gores a man or a woman to death , the bull shall surely be stoned , and its flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief isn 't found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both , whether he hasn 't put his hand to his neighbor 's goods ; and its owner shall accept it , and he shall not make restitution .
" if a man borrows anything of his neighbor 's , and it is injured , or dies , its owner not being with it , he shall surely make restitution .
" if a man entices a virgin who isn 't pledged to be married , and lies with her , he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife .
if you take advantage of them at all , and they cry at all to me , I will surely hear their cry ;

" if you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor , you shall not be to him as a creditor ; neither shall you charge him interest .
if you take your neighbor 's garment as collateral , you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down ,
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gracious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the firstborn of your sons to me .
you shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep . seven days it shall be with its mother , then on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
" you shall not follow a crowd to do evil ; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice ;
" six days you shall do your work , and on the seventh day you shall rest , that your ox and your donkey may have rest , and the son of your handmaid , and the alien may be refreshed .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don 't invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
the first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Yahweh your God . " you shall not boil a young goat in its mother 's milk .
" behold , I send an angel before you , to keep you by the way , and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
pay attention to him , and listen to his voice . Don 't provoke him , for he will not pardon your disobedience , for my name is in him .
but if you indeed listen to his voice , and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and an adversary to your adversaries .
you shall serve Yahweh your God , and he will bless your bread and your water , and I will take sickness away from your midst .
I will send my terror before you , and will confuse all the people to whom you come , and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you .
I will send the hornet before you , which will drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before you .
they shall not dwell in your land , lest they make you sin against me , for if you serve their gods , it will surely be a snare to you . "
Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh , and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do . "
he took the book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yahweh has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Moses took the blood , and sprinkled it on the people , and said , " Look , this is the blood of the Covenant , which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words . "
the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .

the cherubim spread out their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat .
he made the table of acacia wood . its length was two cubits , and its breadth was a cubit , and its height was a cubit and a half .
he cast four rings of gold for it , and put the rings in the four corners that were on its four feet .
he made the poles of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold , to carry the table .
he made the vessels which were on the table , its dishes , its spoons , its bowls , and its pitchers with which to pour out , of pure gold .
he made the lampstand of pure gold . he made the lampstand of beaten work . its base , its Shaft , its cups , its buds , and its flowers were of one piece with it .
there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lampstand out of its one side , and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side :
he made the altar of incense of acacia wood . it was square : its length was a cubit , and its breadth a cubit . its height was two cubits . its horns were of one piece with it .
he overlaid it with pure gold , its top , its sides around it , and its horns . he made a gold molding around it .
he made two golden rings for it under its molding crown , on its two ribs , on its two sides , for places for poles with which to carry it .
he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood . it was square . its length was five cubits , its breadth was five cubits , and its height was three cubits .
he made its horns on its four corners . its horns were of one piece with it , and he overlaid it with brass .
he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , the shovels , the basins , the forks , and the fire pans . he made all its vessels of brass .
he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar , with which to carry it . he made it hollow with planks .
he made the basin of brass , and its base of brass , out of the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the tent of Meeting .
their pillars were twenty , and their sockets twenty , of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver .
and so for the other side : on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
their pillars were four , and their sockets four , of brass ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their capitals , and their fillets , of silver .
with him was Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a skillful workman , and an embroiderer in blue , in purple , in scarlet , and in fine linen .
the silver of those who were numbered of the Congregation was one hundred talents , and one thousand seven hundred seventy @-@ five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
the one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the veil ; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
of the one thousand seven hundred seventy @-@ five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , overlaid their capitals , and made fillets for them .
he put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod , to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he made the breastplate , the work of a skillful workman , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , of blue , purple , scarlet , and fine twined linen .
the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names ; like the engravings of a signet , everyone according to his name , for the twelve tribes .
the other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the two settings , and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod , in its front .
they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , on its edge , which was toward the side of the ephod inward .
they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod underneath , in its front , close by its coupling , above the skillfully woven band of the ephod .
the opening of the robe in its midst was like the opening of a coat of mail , with a binding around its opening , that it should not be torn .
they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote on it a writing , like the engravings of a signet : " Holy TO YAHWEH . "
thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of Meeting was finished . the children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses ; so they did .
Moses saw all the work , and behold , they had done it as Yahweh had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
you shall bring in the table , and set in order the things that are on it . you shall bring in the lampstand , and light its lamps .
you shall set the golden altar for incense before the Ark of the testimony , and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle .
you shall set the basin between the tent of Meeting and the altar , and shall put water therein .
you shall anoint the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and sanctify the altar : and the altar will be most holy .
" you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of Meeting , and shall wash them with water .
you shall put on Aaron the holy garments ; and you shall anoint him , and sanctify him , that he may minister to me in the priest 's office .

it happened in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was raised up .
Moses raised up the tabernacle , and laid its sockets , and set up its boards , and put in its bars , and raised up its pillars .
he took and put the testimony into the Ark , and set the poles on the Ark , and put the mercy seat above on the Ark .
he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the veil of the screen , and screened the Ark of the testimony , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he put the table in the tent of Meeting , on the side of the tabernacle northward , outside of the veil .
he put the lampstand in the tent of Meeting , opposite the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of Meeting , and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
when they went into the tent of Meeting , and when they came near to the altar , they washed , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
he raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the screen of the gate of the court . so Moses finished the work .
Moses wasn 't able to enter into the tent of Meeting , because the cloud stayed on it , and Yahweh 's glory filled the tabernacle .
when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward , throughout all their journeys ;
but if the cloud wasn 't taken up , then they didn 't travel until the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day , and there was fire in the cloud by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .

and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari , according to their service , under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but to the sons of Kohath he gave none , because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them ; they carried it on their shoulders .
the princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes gave their offerings before the altar .
he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah ,

" speak to Aaron , and tell him , ' When you light the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand . ' "
this was the workmanship of the lampstand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
you shall do this to them , to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of cleansing on them , let them shave their whole bodies with a razor , and let them wash their clothes , and cleanse themselves .
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh .

" after that , the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of Meeting : and you shall cleanse them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the womb , even the firstborn of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified them for myself .
the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh ; and Aaron made Atonement for them to cleanse them .
" this is that which belongs to the Levites : from twenty @-@ five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meeting ;
but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of Meeting , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties . "
Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
they kept the Passover in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , at evening , in the wilderness of Sinai . according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were unclean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the Passover on that day , and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it .
whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel traveled ; and in the place where the cloud remained , there the children of Israel encamped .
at the commandment of Yahweh , the children of Israel traveled , and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped . as long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped .
" make two trumpets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Congregation , and for the journeying of the camps .
the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies . Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army .
Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar .
the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari , who bore the tabernacle , went forward .
the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies . Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army .
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the rear guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yahweh does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days ' journey . the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the Ark went forward , that Moses said , " Rise up , Yahweh , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh . when Yahweh heard it , his anger was kindled ; and Yahweh 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly ; and Moses was displeased .
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don 't let me see my wretchedness . "
shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Moses went out , and told the people the words of Yahweh ; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them around the tent .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people , and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague .
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a Cushite woman .
now the man Moses was very humble , above all the men who were on the surface of the earth .
Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forward .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in riddles ; and he shall see Yahweh 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
Aaron said to Moses , " Oh , my lord , please don 't count this sin against us , in which we have done foolishly , and in which we have sinned .
let her not , I pray , be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother 's womb . "
Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they dwell in , whether in camps , or in strongholds ;
they went up by the South , and came to Hebron ; and Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were there . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
they came to the valley of Eshcol , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the pomegranates and figs .
that place was called the valley of Eshcol , because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there .
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said to them , " Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , who were of those who spied out the land , tore their clothes :
and they spoke to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , " The land , which we passed through to spy it out , is an exceeding good land .
if Yahweh delights in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it to us ; a land which flows with milk and honey .
only don 't rebel against Yahweh , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Yahweh is with us . Don 't fear them . "
but all the Congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness , and according as you have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . "
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers , neither shall any of those who despised me see it :
but my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and has followed me fully , him will I bring into the land into which he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley : tomorrow turn , and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . "
but your little ones , that you said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which you have rejected .
I , Yahweh , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil Congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land .
for there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you , and you shall fall by the sword : because you are turned back from following Yahweh , therefore Yahweh will not be with you . "
but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and Moses , didn 't depart out of the camp .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habitations , which I give to you ,
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil :

" ' or for a ram , you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil :

the priest shall make Atonement for the soul who errs , when he sins unwittingly , before Yahweh , to make Atonement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
they put him in custody , because it had not been declared what should be done to him .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue :
and put fire in them , and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Levi ! "
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
it happened , as he made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground split apart that was under them ;
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who appertained to Korah , and all their goods .
but on the next day all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , " You have killed Yahweh 's people ! "
it happened , when the Congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Yahweh appeared .
Yahweh spoke to Moses , saying ,
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the incense , and made Atonement for the people .
now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , besides those who died about the matter of Korah .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .

Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .

" you shall perform the duty of the sanctuary , and the duty of the altar ; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel .

you shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five shekels of money , after the shekel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty gerahs ) .
Yahweh said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tent of Meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
your wave offering shall be reckoned to you , as though it were the grain of the threshing floor , and as the fullness of the winepress .

" whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them .

" if she has a husband , while her vows are on her , or the rash utterance of her lips , with which she has bound her soul ,
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and didn 't disallow her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand .
these are the statutes , which Yahweh commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their encampments , they burnt with fire .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor , and so the plague was among the Congregation of Yahweh .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
" Encamp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
as to every garment , and all that is made of skin , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood , you shall purify yourselves . "
you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and afterward you shall come into the camp . "
" take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Eleazar the priest , and the heads of the fathers ' households of the Congregation ;
and divide the prey into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Congregation .
now the prey , over and above the booty which the men of war took , was six hundred seventy @-@ five thousand sheep ,
and thirty @-@ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @-@ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands , and the captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ;
and they said to Moses , " Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels .
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh .
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don 't bring us over the Jordan . "
for when they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them .
Yahweh 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh , was consumed .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
and the land is subdued before Yahweh ; then afterward you shall return , and be guiltless towards Yahweh , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh .
so Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fathers ' households of the tribes of the children of Israel .
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , " As Yahweh has said to your servants , so will we do .
the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kiriathaim ,
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
they traveled from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians ,
they traveled from before Hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and encamped in Marah .
they traveled from Marah , and came to Elim : and in Elim were twelve springs of water , and seventy palm trees ; and they encamped there .
they traveled from Kadesh , and encamped in Mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the South in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their molten images , and demolish all their high places .
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
" ' this shall be your north border : from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor ;
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad ;
and the border shall go forth to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down , and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward ;
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
" these are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun .
of the children of Joseph : of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Levites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @-@ two cities .
all the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty @-@ eight cities together with their suburbs .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
" ' but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge , where he flees ,
and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
" ' moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death ; but he shall surely be put to death .
" ' you shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge , that he may come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
and they said , " Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
this is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance . "
the daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses :
they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
Yahweh , the God of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and bless you , as he has promised you !
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which Yahweh our God gives to us .
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the valley of Eshcol , and spied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us . "
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cloud by day .
Joshua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
the Amorites , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and beat you down in Seir , even to Hormah .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yahweh spoke to me ; and we encircled Mount Seir many days .
Yahweh spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
Don 't contend with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on ; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession .
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim , who came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn 't come near ; all the side of the river Jabbok , and the cities of the hill country , and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
but all the livestock , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon .
this land we took in possession at that time : from Aroer , which is by the valley of the Arnon , and half the hill country of Gilead , and its cities , gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites :
the Arabah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , " Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over .
go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up your eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you .
behold , I have taught you statutes and ordinances , even as Yahweh my God commanded me , that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it .
take therefore good heed to yourselves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire .
furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance :
take heed to yourselves , lest you forget the Covenant of Yahweh your God , which he made with you , and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you .
but from there you shall seek Yahweh your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul .
when you are in oppression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yahweh your God is a merciful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the Covenant of your fathers which he swore to them .
that the manslayer might flee there , who kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Moses spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
Yahweh didn 't make this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yahweh and you at that time , to show you the word of Yahweh : for you were afraid because of the fire , and didn 't go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an engraved image for yourself , any likeness of what is in heaven above , or what is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more , then we shall die .
go near , and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say : and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
Oh that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children forever !
you shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
now this is the commandment , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it ;
and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your might .
and you shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a Jealous God ; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the earth .
you shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers ,
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimonies , the statutes , and the ordinances , which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were Pharaoh 's bondservants in Egypt : and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand ;
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their altars , and dash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Asherim , and burn their engraved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God : Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Yahweh didn 't set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fewest of all peoples :
know therefore that Yahweh your God , he is God , the faithful God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ,
and repays those who hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him who hates him , he will repay him to his face .
Yahweh will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a snare to you .
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , perish from before you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consume them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers .
a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills you may dig copper .
beware lest you forget Yahweh your God , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have eaten and are full , and have built goodly houses , and lived therein ;
and when your herds and your flocks multiply , and your silver and your gold is multiplied , and all that you have is multiplied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yahweh your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery Serpents and Scorpions , and thirsty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna , which your fathers didn 't know ; that he might humble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his Covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
as the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you , so you shall perish ; because you wouldn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Who can stand before the sons of Anak ? "
it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sinned against Yahweh your God ; you had made yourselves a molten calf : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you .
I took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you . but Yahweh listened to me that time also .
remember your servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; don 't look to the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ark . "
I turned and came down from the mountain , and put the tables in the Ark which I had made ; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his place .
for Yahweh your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who doesn 't respect persons , nor takes reward .
know this day : for I don 't speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his outstretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
but the land , where you go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yahweh your God cares for : the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Yahweh your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your grain , and your new wine , and your oil .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and you turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul ; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Yahweh your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
the blessing , if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God , which I command you this day ;
it shall happen , when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it , that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim , and the curse on Mount Ebal .
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you , and you shall possess it , and dwell therein .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
but to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his habitation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yahweh your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but when you go over the Jordan , and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit , and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you , so that you dwell in safety ;
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
take heed to yourself that you don 't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so you shall eat of it : the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only your holy things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose :
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dispossess them , and you dispossess them , and dwell in their land ;
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye pity him , neither shall you spare , neither shall you conceal him :
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
then you shall inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is done in the midst of you ,
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God , and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the ibex , and the antelope , and the chamois .
every animal that parts the hoof , and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pig , because it has a split hoof but doesn 't chew the cud , is unclean to you : of their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
and the red kite , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not harden your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall surely open your hand to him , and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God : you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd , nor shear the firstborn of your flock .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God ; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Yahweh shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
you shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your tents .
you shall count for yourselves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
you shall not wrest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
you shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox , or a sheep , in which is a blemish , or anything evil ; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
and has gone and served other gods , and worshiped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
and you shall come to the priests the Levites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inquire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
it shall be , when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book , out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
this shall be the priests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep , that they shall give to the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreigner , and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God , as all his brothers the Levites do , who stand there before Yahweh .
when you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices sorcery , or an enchanter , or a sorcerer ,
you shall be perfect with Yahweh your God .
for these nations , that you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice sorcery , and to diviners ; but as for you , Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
when Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yahweh your God gives you , and you succeed them , and dwell in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man hates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mortally so that he dies , and he flees into one of these cities ;
your eye shall not pity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yahweh , before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified falsely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak to the people ,
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you , and shall serve you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it , lying in the field , and it isn 't known who has struck him ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water , which is neither plowed nor sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the valley .
the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him , and to bless in the name of Yahweh ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
forgive , Yahweh , your people Israel , whom you have redeemed , and don 't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel . " the blood shall be forgiven them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands , and you carry them away captive ,
and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has , that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
you shall not see your brother 's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way , and hide yourself from them : you shall surely help him to lift them up again .
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a battlement for your roof , that you don 't bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
then shall the father of the young lady , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady 's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
if there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
if a man find a lady who is a virgin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they didn 't meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
you shall not abhor an Edomite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abhor an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
and you shall have a paddle among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall dig therewith , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be Slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
when you come into your neighbor 's vineyard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that you observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so you shall observe to do .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt , and Yahweh your God redeemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
it shall be , that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blotted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don 't want to take her " ;
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
the priest shall take the basket out of your hand , and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God .
and we cried to Yahweh , the God of our fathers , and Yahweh heard our voice , and saw our affliction , and our toil , and our oppression ;
and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with wonders ;
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you swore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
you have declared Yahweh this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and listen to his voice :
and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his commandments ;
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount Ebal , and you shall plaster them with plaster .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
you shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
and all these blessings shall come on you , and overtake you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh ; and they shall be afraid of you .
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock shall be Cursed .
Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the earth ; and there shall be none to frighten them away .
Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt , and with the tumors , and with the scurvy , and with the itch , of which you can not be healed .
and you shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropes in darkness , and you shall not prosper in your ways : and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a vineyard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
because you didn 't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , YAHWEH your God ;
then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful , and the plagues of your seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and severe sicknesses , and of long continuance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Yahweh will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
and your life shall hang in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assurance of your life .
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
when you came to this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half @-@ tribe of the Manassites .
that you may enter into the Covenant of Yahweh your God , and into his oath , which Yahweh your God makes with you this day ;
Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that is written in this book of the law .
then men shall say , " Because they forsook the Covenant of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yahweh your God has scattered you .
if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart , and the heart of your seed , to love Yahweh your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , that you may live .
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce to you this day , that you shall surely perish ; you shall not prolong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yahweh has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yahweh your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dispossess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Yahweh has spoken .
Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
be strong and courageous , don 't be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Yahweh your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor forsake you . "
Yahweh , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither forsake you : Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , and to all the elders of Israel .
Moses commanded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of tents ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yahweh your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
it happened , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall condense as the dew , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the herb .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yahweh 's portion is his people . Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to suck honey out of the rock , oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sleek . then he forsook God who made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
they sacrificed to demons , not God , to gods that they didn 't know , to new gods that came up recently , which your fathers didn 't dread .
of the Rock who became your father , you are unmindful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faithfulness .
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the teeth of animals on them , With the poison of crawling things of the dust .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrongly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Yahweh has not done all this . ' "
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , of the fields of Gomorrah . their grapes are grapes of gall , Their clusters are bitter .
vengeance is mine , and recompense , at the time when their foot slides ; for the day of their calamity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make haste . "
if I whet my glittering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will recompense those who hate me .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood . my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will avenge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make expiation for his land , for his people .
for it is no vain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to possess it . "
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor , and was gathered to his people :
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
this is the blessing , with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness , for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the sand . "
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead , to Dan ,
now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' servant , saying ,
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
from the wilderness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don 't know . pursue them quickly ; for you will overtake them . "
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof .
the men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords : and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out , they shut the gate .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had returned . the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but didn 't find them .
then the two men returned , descended from the mountain , passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
Joshua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Shittim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lodged there before they passed over .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant being before the people ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the Ark of the Covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ark of Yahweh passed over , with the priests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke to them .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the east border of Jericho .
this is the reason Joshua circumcised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circumcised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circumcised by Joshua ; for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circumcising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns before Yahweh advanced , and blew the trumpets ; and the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh followed them .
so he caused the Ark of Yahweh to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
but as for you , only keep yourselves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy to Yahweh . they shall come into Yahweh 's treasury . "
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh 's house .
the men of AI struck about thirty @-@ six men of them , and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
he brought near the family of Judah ; and he selected the family of the Zerahites . he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man , and Zabdi was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was selected .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yahweh .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to AI . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of valor , and sent them out by night .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yahweh . behold , I have commanded you . "
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursued Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in AI or Beth El who didn 't go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursued Israel .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and killed the men of AI .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become moldy .
these wineskins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a Covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel didn 't strike them , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh , the God of Israel . all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be on us , because of the oath which we swore to them . "
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are Cursed , and some of you will never fail to be bondservants , both wood cutters and Drawers of water for the house of my God . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they didn 't kill them .
so Joshua went up from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
Yahweh confused them before Israel , and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon , and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah .
but don 't stay . pursue your enemies , and them from the rear . Don 't allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed , and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
it happened , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , to the king of Shimron , to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Arabah south of Chinneroth , in the lowland , and in the heights of Dor on the west ,
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with very many horses and chariots .
Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and chased them to great Sidon , and to Misrephoth Maim , and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breathed . he burnt Hazor with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded .
for it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might utterly destroy them , that they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Yahweh commanded Moses .
there were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , did some remain .
and the border of Og king of Bashan , of the remnant of the Rephaim , who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,

nevertheless the children of Israel didn 't drive out the Geshurites , nor the Maacathites : but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . the offerings of Yahweh , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inheritance , as he spoke to him .
their border was from Aroer , that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the city that is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain by Medeba ;

I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom , even to the wilderness of Zin southward , at the uttermost part of the south .
their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea , from the bay that looks southward ;
and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea , and passed along by Hezron , went up to Addar , and turned about to Karka ;

it went out from Bethel to Luz , and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth ;
and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites , to the border of Beth Horon the lower , even to Gezer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar , to Beth Horon the upper .
the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh , and passed along it on the east of Janoah .
from Tappuah the border went along westward to the Brook of Kanah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath , which is before Shechem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of En Tappuah .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea was his border . they reached to Asher on the north , and to Issachar on the east .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and didn 't utterly drive them out .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh , and set up the tent of Meeting there . the land was subdued before them .
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .

this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
so they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders . the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun in their midst .
according to the commandment of Yahweh , they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yahweh spoke to Joshua , saying ,
they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( the same is Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
the children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben , out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun .
they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi ; for theirs was the first lot .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , Libnah with its suburbs ,
the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites , even the rest of the children of Kohath , had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
to the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its suburbs , Kartah with its suburbs ,
all these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families , even the rest of the families of the Levites . their lot was twelve cities .
all the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty @-@ eight cities with their suburbs .
Yahweh gave them rest all around , according to all that he swore to their fathers . not a man of all their enemies stood before them . Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand .
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , one prince of a fathers ' house for each of the tribes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the Congregation of Yahweh ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yahweh , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Congregation of Israel .
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh answered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
Yahweh your God will thrust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall possess their land , as Yahweh your God spoke to you .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
" for Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh .
it happened after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of Yahweh , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah , which is in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , and had known all the work of Yahweh , that he had worked for Israel .
it happened after the death of Joshua , the children of Israel asked of Yahweh , saying , " Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? "
the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the lowland .
Yahweh was with Judah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Zebulun didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
Asher didn 't drive out the inhabitants of Acco , nor the inhabitants of Sidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob ;
but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley ;
but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres , in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
and you shall make no Covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their altars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
it happened , when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel .
they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , on the north of the mountain of Gaash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , who didn 't know Yahweh , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
wherever they went out , the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil , as Yahweh had spoken , and as Yahweh had sworn to them : and they were very distressed .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel ; and he said , " Because this nation have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not listened to my voice ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
the children of Israel lived among the Canaanites , the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh , Yahweh raised up a Savior to the children of Israel , who saved them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he didn 't draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
then Ehud went forth into the porch , and shut the doors of the upper room on him , and locked them .
they waited until they were ashamed ; and behold , he didn 't open the doors of the upper room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
it happened , when he had come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
however Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
" hear , you kings ! give ear , you princes ! I , even I , will sing to Yahweh . I will sing praise to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" Yahweh , when you went forth out of Seir , when you marched out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
the mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh , even Sinai , at the presence of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied . the travelers walked through byways .
the princes of Issachar were with Deborah . as was Issachar , so was Barak . they rushed into the valley at his feet . by the watercourses of Reuben , there were great resolves of heart .
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
she put her hand to the tent peg , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer . with the hammer she struck Sisera . she struck through his head . yes , she pierced and struck through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cried : Sisera 's mother looked through the lattice . ' why is his chariot so long in coming ? why do the wheels of his chariots wait ? '
" so let all your enemies perish , Yahweh , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel ; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all who oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
the angel of Yahweh came , and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down . "
he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the Fleece together , and wrung the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude .
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets , and empty pitchers , with torches within the pitchers .
when I blow the trumpet , I and all who are with me , then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and shout , ' For Yahweh and for Gideon ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after Midian .
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
it happened , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the prostitute after the Baals , and made Baal Berith their god .
the children of Israel didn 't remember Yahweh their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem .
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and lived there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , " behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
Abimelech rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people who were with him , from the ambush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the roof of the tower .
Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man to his place .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was very distressed .
Yahweh said to the children of Israel , " Didn 't I save you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpah .
the people , the princes of Gilead , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . "
now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a prostitute : and Gilead became the father of Jephthah .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob ;
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
I therefore have not sinned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yahweh , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon . "
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house ; and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and didn 't bear .
the angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman , and said to her , " See now , you are barren , and don 't bear ; but you shall conceive , and bear a son .
God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah , her husband , wasn 't with her .
the woman made haste , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " behold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh , " Please , let us detain you , that we may make a young goat ready for you . "
so Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Yahweh . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of Yahweh didn 't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more . then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and behold , a young lion roared against him .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain , and also the olive groves .
he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam .
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ramath Lehi .
Samson said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was troubled to death .
the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country , who has slain many of us , into our hand . "
and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests , that I may lean on them . "
Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested , and leaned on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
the man departed out of the city , out of Bethlehem Judah , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he traveled .
Micah consecrated the Levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
there set forth from there of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , even to the house of Micah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the engraved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image , the priest said to them , " What are you doing ? "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was Laish at the first .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be merry . "
when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , " Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gibeah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " Where are you going ? where did you come from ? "
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , to Yahweh at Mizpah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this wickedness happen ? "
the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered , " I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
the men of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have slain me , and they forced my concubine , and she is dead .
I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty @-@ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they didn 't know that evil was close on them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah .
the ambushers hurried , and rushed on Gibeah ; and the ambushers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them ; and behold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
the whole Congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon , and proclaimed peace to them .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
Yahweh grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Naomi ? "
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
she went , and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said to the reapers , " Yahweh be with you . " they answered him , " Yahweh bless you . "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
May Yahweh repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yahweh , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
so she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz , to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she went down to the threshing floor , and did according to all that her mother @-@ in @-@ law told her .
now , my daughter , don 't be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
he said to the near kinsman , " Naomi , who has come back out of the country of Moab , is selling the parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's .
when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yahweh , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and didn 't eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh 's temple .
she said , " Let your handmaid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression wasn 't sad any more .
it happened , when the time had come , that Hannah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Yahweh . "
but Hannah didn 't go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yahweh , and stay there forever . "
when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bulls , and one ephah of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Yahweh 's house in Shiloh . the child was young .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don 't let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Yahweh is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hungry are satisfied . yes , the barren has borne seven . she who has many children languishes .
he will keep the feet of his holy ones , but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness ; for no man shall prevail by strength .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith . so they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meeting .
a man of God came to Eli , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the affliction of my habitation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my anointed forever .
it happened at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
Yahweh said to Samuel , " behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he didn 't restrain them .
the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Philistines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
the Philistines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Woe to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Woe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
the Philistines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day , with his clothes torn , and with earth on his head .
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " Don 't be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she didn 't answer , neither did she regard it .
when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day , behold , Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of Yahweh . they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any who come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod , to this day .
the men who didn 't die were struck with the tumors ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , " What shall we do with the Ark of Yahweh ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no yoke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
and they put the Ark of Yahweh on the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors .
they of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the cart , and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh : for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
the men of Kiriath Jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of Yahweh , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of Yahweh .
it happened , from the day that the Ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don 't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yahweh thundered with a great Thunder on that day on the Philistines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and struck them , until they came under Beth Kar .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even to Gath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines . there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
Yahweh said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive groves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your donkeys , and put them to his work .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the donkeys , and be anxious for us . "
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , behold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yahweh . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul , and spoke these words in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
" when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yahweh your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Yahweh has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yahweh , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh , but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh , then will the hand of Yahweh be against you , as it was against your fathers .
for Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in coverts , and in pits .
now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might greet him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal , and I haven 't entreated the favor of Yahweh . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
but now your kingdom shall not continue . Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you . "
the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah , to the land of Shual ;
the one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash , and the other on the south in front of Geba .
both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , " behold , the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armor bearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a furrow 's length in an acre of land .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and calves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
there was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to him .
thus says Yahweh of Armies , ' I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Samuel said to him , " Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you .
Samuel said , " As your sword has made women childless , so your mother will be childless among women ! " Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal .
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and encamped in the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was clad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
when the words were heard which David spoke , they rehearsed them before Saul ; and he sent for him .
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
Saul dressed David with his clothing . he put a helmet of brass on his head , and he clad him with a coat of mail .
when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and withal of a fair face .
and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn 't save with sword and spear : for the battle is Yahweh 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hurried , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and struck the Philistine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @-@ in @-@ law . the days were not expired ;
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
when the messengers came in , behold , the teraphim was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
he went there to Naioth in Ramah . then the Spirit of God came on him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , you shall not be established , nor your kingdom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall surely die ! "
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
it happened in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " Isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don 't delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Yahweh ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul .
David arose , and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Adullam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their livestock , and killed them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . Saul sought him every day , but God didn 't deliver him into his hand .
then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , " Doesn 't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the desert ?
they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah on the south of the desert .
Saul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . when Saul heard that , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , " behold , David is in the wilderness of En Gedi . "
so David checked his men with these words , and didn 't allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand , you didn 't kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away unharmed ? therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' Long life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
God do so to the enemies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall . "
when Abigail saw David , she hurried , and alighted from her donkey , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
now this present which your servant has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men who follow my lord .
please forgive the trespass of your handmaid . for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
it shall come to pass , when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you prince over Israel ,
blessed is your discretion , and blessed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness , and from avenging myself with my own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " behold , your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Abigail hurried , and arose , and rode on a donkey , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
he said , " Why does my lord pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in my hand ?
now therefore , don 't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea , as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains . "
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Achish the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
David lived with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , and didn 't execute his fierce wrath on Amalek , therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
the woman had a fattened calf in the house . she hurried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread of it .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has slain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South , and on Ziklag , and had struck Ziklag , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they didn 't kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
we made a raid on the South of the Cherethites , and on that which belongs to Judah , and on the South of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire . "
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , " behold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh . "
and to those who were in Hormah , and to those who were in Borashan , and to those who were in Athach ,
the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth ; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan .
it happened after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had stayed two days in Ziklag ;
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
then David took hold on his clothes , and tore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
( and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jashar ) :
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swifter than eagles . they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of Hebron .
the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be valiant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them . "
now Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's army , had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
the battle was very severe that day : and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he didn 't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
but Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah , that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
Joab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and came to Mahanaim .
they took up Asahel , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Joab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at Hebron .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
it happened , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul .
her husband went with her , weeping as he went , and followed her to Bahurim . then Abner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
you know Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into fetters . as a man falls before the children of iniquity , so you fell . " all the people wept again over him .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner .
the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stronghold .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
they set the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon , Uzzah reached for the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah ; and God struck him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
so David would not move the Ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
it was so , that , when those who bore the Ark of Yahweh had gone six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf .
they brought in the Ark of Yahweh , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies .
I will be yet more vile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore you shall tell my servant David this , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people , over Israel .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before you .
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
therefore you are great , Yahweh God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for you , Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
after this it happened that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Seraiah was scribe ;
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
so Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . then Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
Hadadezer sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Helam , with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
it happened at evening , that David arose from off his bed , and walked on the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her uncleanness ) ; and she returned to her house .
when Uriah had come to him , David asked of him how Joab did , and how the people fared , and how the war prospered .
David said to Uriah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and didn 't go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
it happened , when Joab kept watch on the city , that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Didn 't you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . "
the elders of his house arose beside him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fasted and wept for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David 's brother ; and Jonadab was a very subtle man .
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Amnon said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Amnon said to Tamar , " Bring the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother .
when she had brought them near to him to eat , he took hold of her , and said to her , " Come , lie with me , my sister ! "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were virgins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mule , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Absalom has slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don 't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead . "
but Absalom fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and wept . the king also and all his servants wept bitterly .
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
so Joab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and kissed him .
Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed to Yahweh , in Hebron .
two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem , who were invited , and went in their simplicity ; and they didn 't know anything .
Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counselor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
but if he say thus , ' I have no delight in you ; ' behold , here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was worshiped , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn , and earth on his head .
Don 't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz , Zadok 's son , and Jonathan , Abiathar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him , and Cursed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw dust .
it happened , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , had come to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
again , whom should I serve ? Shouldn 't I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
so they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house ; and Absalom went in to his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
even he who is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are valiant men .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there isn 't one small stone found there . "
Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab . now Amasa was the son of a man , whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
they took Absalom , and cast him into the great pit in the forest , and raised over him a very great heap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king grieves for his son . "
he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjamite , who was of Bahurim , hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your servant knows that I have sinned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why didn 't you go with me , Mephibosheth ? "
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gilgal , and Chimham went over with him . all the people of Judah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri ; but the men of Judah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
so Amasa went to call the men of Judah together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth Maacah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall surely ask counsel at Abel ; ' and so they settled it .
now Joab was over all the army of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Yahweh 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son : and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged .
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the tomb of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . after that God was entreated for the land .
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Philistines at Gob ; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite 's brother , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my Savior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from my enemies .
in my distress I called on Yahweh . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry came into his ears .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh , At the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
you will save the afflicted people , But your eyes are on the haughty , that you may bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
I have consumed them , and struck them through , so that they can 't arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth . I crushed them as the mire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the strivings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
the foreigners will submit themselves to me . as soon as they hear of me , they will obey me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righteously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without clouds , when the tender grass springs out of the earth , through clear shining after rain . '
but all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away , because they can 't be taken with the hand ,
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite , against eight hundred slain at one time .
after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of lentils ; and the people fled from the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam ; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Wasn 't he most honorable of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
and came to the stronghold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites , and of the Canaanites ; and they went out to the south of Judah , at Beersheba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
Araunah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Araunah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood :
now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he couldn 't keep warm .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
behold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders . "
they told the king , saying , " behold , Nathan the prophet ! " when he had come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but he hasn 't called me , even me your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon .
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule , and bring him down to Gihon .
all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
Adonijah feared because of Solomon ; and he arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh , that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh , which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
the news came to Joab ; for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he didn 't turn after Absalom . Joab fled to the tent of Yahweh , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Brook Kidron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
the king said moreover to Shimei , " You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head .
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
now , Yahweh my God , you have made your servant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don 't know how to go out or come in .
your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can 't be numbered nor counted for multitude .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while your handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
Baana the son of Ahilud , in Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan , beneath Jezreel , from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah , as far as beyond Jokmeam ;
Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tribute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures , and one hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and roebucks , and fattened fowl .
for he had dominion over all on this side the River , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all the nations all around .
Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil . Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was its length , according to the breadth of the house . ten cubits was its breadth before the house .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temple and of the oracle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quarry ; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
within the oracle was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in its height ; and he overlaid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with cedar .
the whole house he overlaid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold .
five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
and two doors of fir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
he made the porch of pillars ; its length was fifty cubits , and its breadth thirty cubits ; and a porch before them ; and pillars and a threshold before them .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the porch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Pharaoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this porch .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
it was a handbreadth thick : and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it held two thousand baths .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the ledges ;
and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubim ; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
the four wheels were underneath the panels ; and the axles of the wheels were in the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axles , and their rims , and their spokes , and their naves , were all molten .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engraved cherubim , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wreaths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
Hiram made the basins , and the shovels , and the basins . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh :
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ;
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hiram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yahweh , were of burnished brass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh : the golden altar , and the table whereupon the show bread was , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , who were assembled to him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
it came to pass , when the priests had come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh ,
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh .
he said , " blessed is Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the Ark , in which is the Covenant of Yahweh , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can 't contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his supplication , Yahweh my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day ;
listen to the supplication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers .
whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your mighty hand , and of your outstretched arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
( for they are your people , and your inheritance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant , and to the supplication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh , he arose from before the altar of Yahweh , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven .
that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yahweh and the king 's house
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they didn 't please him .
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
as for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fifty , who bore rule over the people who labored in the work .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
Hiram sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . behold , the half was not told me ! your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in droves , each drove at a price .
then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
however I will not tear away all the kingdom ; but I will give one tribe to your son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
for it happened , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain , and had struck every male in Edom
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's house among the sons of Pharaoh .
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and lived therein , and reigned in Damascus .
Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite of Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breach of the city of David his father .
it happened at that time , when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him , and tore it in twelve pieces .
( but he shall have one tribe , for my servant David 's sake and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tribes .
to his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
I will take you , and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires , and shall be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam ; but Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , aren 't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones . King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
" speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El : and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense .
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back ;
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the donkey stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
behold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the donkey , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn , and to bury him .
this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth .
take with you ten loaves , and cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
he who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yahweh has spoken it . " '
he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , which he has sinned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh , the guard bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and didn 't turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
he brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben Hadad listened to king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck Ijon , and Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and lived in Tirzah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
behold , I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
the dogs will eat Baasha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him . now he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household in Tirzah :
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he committed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he showed , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
so he went and did according to the word of Yahweh ; for he went and lived by the Brook Cherith , that is before the Jordan .
the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
for thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the jar of meal didn 't empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke by Elijah .
Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " behold , your son lives . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah , in the third year , saying , " Go , show yourself to Ahab ; and I will send rain on the earth . "
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh , that Obadiah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
it was so , when midday was past , that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of Yahweh came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
then the fire of Yahweh fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yahweh , he is God ! Yahweh , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " seize the prophets of Baal ! Don 't let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and killed them there .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the coals , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
it shall happen , that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu will kill ; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed to Baal , and every mouth which has not kissed him . "
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben Hadad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @-@ two . after them , he mustered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty @-@ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samaria . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the princes of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
do this thing : take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their place .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who dwells in Samaria . behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
the dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
say , ' Thus says the king , " Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke .
Jehoshaphat was thirty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he showed , and how he warred , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
behold , fire came down from the sky , and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties . but now let my life be precious in your sight . "
so he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken . Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cursed them in the name of Yahweh . two female bears came out of the woods , and mauled forty @-@ two of those youths .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs , and of one hundred thousand rams .
for thus says Yahweh , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on armor , and upward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites .
when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and pour out into all those containers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
then she saddled a donkey , and said to her servant , " Drive , and go forward ! Don 't slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
when Elisha had come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
the Syrians had gone out in bands , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his leprosy . "
Aren 't Abanah and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Couldn 't I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
please let us go to the Jordan , and every man take a beam from there , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . " he answered , " Go ! "
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water . then he cried , and said , " Alas , my master ! for it was borrowed . "
now the king of Syria was warring against Israel ; and he took counsel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
there was a great famine in Samaria . behold , they besieged it , until a donkey 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a kab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
they rose up in the twilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years .
in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife . he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
twenty @-@ two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when you come there , find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
you shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish . I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses . then he trampled her under foot .
they went to bury her ; but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the body of Jezebel shall be as Dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel , so that they shall not say , " This is Jezebel . " ' "
now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , to the rulers of Jezreel , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fortified city also , and armor .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jezreel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I conspired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh , which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab . for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
so Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
when he came to Samaria , he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yahweh , which he spoke to Elijah .
however from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin , Jehu didn 't depart from after them , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king .
you shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be slain . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yahweh .
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the horses ' entry to the king 's house . she was slain there .
so all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet . Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king 's house .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
but there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver , snuffers , basins , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh ;
moreover they didn 't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the trespass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Yahweh : it was the priests ' .
now the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and struck Joash at the house of Millo , on the way that goes down to Silla .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he didn 't depart from it .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael , continually .
nevertheless they didn 't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria . )
for he didn 't leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .

he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
but Amaziah would not listen . so Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any helper for Israel .
Yahweh didn 't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
now the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Jotham his son reigned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Zechariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and killed him , and reigned in his place .

there came against the land Pul the king of Assyria ; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
now the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .

Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and struck him , and killed him , and reigned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
now the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
he was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh ; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath , and lived there , to this day .
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
Urijah the priest built an altar : according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus , so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus .
when the king had come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king drew near to the altar , and offered on it .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
the bronze altar , which was before Yahweh , he brought from the forefront of the house , from between his altar and the house of Yahweh , and put it on the north side of his altar .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away to Assyria , and placed them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he tore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they didn 't depart from them ;
until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day .
so one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear Yahweh .
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom Yahweh had made a Covenant , and commanded them , saying , " You shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
he trusted in Yahweh , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria , and put them in Halah , and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
because they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh their God , but transgressed his Covenant , even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh 's temple , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus says the king , ' Don 't let Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , came with Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " behold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent messengers again to Hezekiah , saying ,
'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , " Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Telassar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ? " ' "
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it . then Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh , and spread it before Yahweh .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
haven 't you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
" therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
it happened that night , that the angel of Yahweh went out , and struck one hundred eighty @-@ five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yahweh came to him , saying ,
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
at that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
'Of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ' "
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hephzibah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his place .
Amon was twenty @-@ two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and he forsook Yahweh , the God of his fathers , and didn 't walk in the way of Yahweh .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty @-@ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in all the way of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Yahweh , saying ,
" go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt faithfully . "
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh . " Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
he killed all the priests of the high places that were there , on the altars , and burned men 's bones on them ; and he returned to Jerusalem .
surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
notwithstanding , Yahweh didn 't turn from the fierceness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , aren 't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Jehoahaz was twenty @-@ three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .

Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , according to all that his father had done .
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city , while his servants were besieging it ;
the king of Babylon made Mattaniah , Jehoiachin 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
he burnt the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Babylon , and the residue of the multitude .
the captain of the guard took away the fire pans , the basins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pillars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh , the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .

he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain : however he didn 't attain to the three .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow : they were of Saul 's brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
these of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father 's house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul .
of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous men in their fathers ' houses .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
of the Danites who could set the battle in array , twenty @-@ eight thousand six hundred .
of Asher , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , forty thousand .
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
they carried the Ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ark ; and there he died before God .
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
for because you didn 't carry it at first , Yahweh our God made broke out against us , because we didn 't seek him according to the ordinance . "
the children of the Levites bore the Ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed Lyre , to lead .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
they brought in the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians twenty @-@ two thousand men .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yahweh do that which seems good to him . "
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
David said to God , " I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . "
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed .
there are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work :
the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @-@ eight thousand .
David said , " Of these , twenty @-@ four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn 't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
of the Izharites , Shelomoth ; of the sons of Shelomoth , Jahath .
of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asharelah , the sons of Asaph , under the hand of Asaph , who prophesied after the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
for the divisions of the doorkeepers : of the Korahites , Meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of Asaph .
also to Shemaiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of valor .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yahweh .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fathers ' houses , for every gate .
these were the divisions of the doorkeepers ; of the sons of the Korahites , and of the sons of Merari .
of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Ladan , the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan , the heads of the fathers ' households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite : Jehieli .
he was of the children of Perez , the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @-@ four thousand .
this is that Benaiah , who was the mighty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Ammizabad his son .
furthermore over the tribes of Israel : of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler : of the Simeonites , Shephatiah the son of Maacah :
of the children of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Azaziah : of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh , Joel the son of Pedaiah :
but David didn 't take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but didn 't finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite : and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite : and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite .
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the forks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot , the cherubim , that spread out , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh , under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
for we are strangers before you , and foreigners , as all our fathers were . our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty @-@ three years in Jerusalem .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh , which was at the tent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon , from before the tent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he reigned over Israel .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @-@ three thousand six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
the porch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cubits , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
the wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @-@ five cubits high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
he made chains in the oracle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it .
under it was the likeness of oxen , which encircled it , for ten cubits , encircling the sea . the oxen were in two rows , cast when it was cast .
it was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup , like the flower of a Lily : it received and held three thousand baths .
he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid their doors with brass .
Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basins . so Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks ; two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb , when Yahweh made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers .
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers .
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their petitions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
" now , my God , let , I beg you , your eyes be open , and let your ears be attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
the priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh , because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh 's house .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @-@ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the Goodness that Yahweh had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
now my eyes shall be open , and my ears attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
but if you turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Yahweh done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth Horon the upper , and Beth Horon the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel didn 't consume , of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh , and until it was finished . so the house of Yahweh was completed .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty @-@ six talents of gold ,
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any kingdom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland , for abundance .
King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
and he appointed him priests for the high places , and for the male goats , and for the calves which he had made .
Rehoboam took him a wife , Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David , and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ;
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Yahweh , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with its towns , and Jeshanah with its towns , and Ephron with its towns .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and ASA his son reigned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred chariots ; and he came to Mareshah .
but when in their distress they turned to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
they entered into the Covenant to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
and that whoever would not seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and its timber , with which Baasha had built ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethanel , and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
he had many works in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , mighty men of valor , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Yahweh ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor .
after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead .
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and struck Micaiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you ? "
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem : and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim , and brought them back to Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yahweh , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them some of the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
when Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah ; for there they blessed Yahweh : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries , when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel .
he walked in the way of ASA his father , and didn 't turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
he had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
however Yahweh would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
then Jehoram passed over with his captains , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , along with the captains of the chariots .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day : then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did the house of Ahab ; for they were his counselors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
all the assembly made a Covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Baal , and broke it down , and broke his altars and his images in pieces , and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals .
all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
so the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king listened to them .
they forsook the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherim and the idols : and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
thus Joash the king didn 't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . "
Amaziah was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan , of Jerusalem .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
Amaziah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
so Joash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , aren 't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty @-@ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jechiliah , of Jerusalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the heads of fathers ' households , even the mighty men of valor , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared for them , even for all the army , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and stones for slinging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he didn 't enter into Yahweh 's temple . the people still did corruptly .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , killed Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the ruler of the house , and Elkanah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . Aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the captives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you . "
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yahweh , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with Yahweh , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don 't be negligent now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn incense . "
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed , have we prepared and sanctified ; and behold , they are before the altar of Yahweh . "
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves : therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean , to sanctify them to Yahweh .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the Brook that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? "
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
Doesn 't Hezekiah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ? '
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jerusalem , as of the gods of the peoples of the earth , which are the work of men 's hands .
thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all kinds of goodly vessels ;
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
he prayed to him ; and he was entreated by him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he didn 't humble himself before Yahweh , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but this same Amon trespassed more and more .
but the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh , Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses .
Shaphan carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he tore his clothes .
the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day , to keep the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds , according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh ,
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God ; he didn 't humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh .
he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and scoffed at his prophets , until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people , until there was no remedy .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
then the heads of fathers ' households of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Hassophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty @-@ two .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of tents , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the ordinance , as the duty of every day required ;
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new moons , of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated , and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Yahweh .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh ; but the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was not yet laid .
and hired counselors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dishonor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tribute , custom , and toll , was paid to them .
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that Tattenai , the governor beyond the River , and Shetharbozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were beyond the River , sent to Darius the king ;
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a scroll , and therein was thus written for a record :
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
for the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom . of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel . of the sons of David , Hattush .
of the sons of Shecaniah , of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah ; and with him one hundred sixty males .
of the sons of Adonikam , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava ; and there we encamped three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were mentioned by name .
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
so the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their trespass of the captivity ; and I sat confounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they swore .
they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
they said to me , " The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , " I beg you , Yahweh , the God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who keeps Covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you trespass , I will scatter you abroad among the peoples ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then went I up in the night by the Brook , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the valley gate , and so returned .
next to them , the Tekoites made repairs ; but their nobles didn 't put their necks to the work of their lord .
Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the old gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its bolts , and its bars .
next to them , Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , repaired the residence of the governor beyond the River .
next to him , Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , goldsmiths , made repairs . next to him , Hananiah one of the perfumers made repairs , and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall .

after him , Malchijah one of the goldsmiths to the house of the Nethinim , and of the merchants , made repairs over against the gate of Hammiphkad , and to the ascent of the corner .
but it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
Don 't cover their iniquity , and don 't let their sin be blotted out from before you ; for they have insulted the builders . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trumpet was by me .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clothes . everyone took his weapon to the water .
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and Tobiah 's letters came to them .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy @-@ three .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua , of Kadmiel , of the children of Hodevah , seventy @-@ four .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty @-@ two .
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand two hundred minas of silver .
Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinctly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they confessed , and worshiped Yahweh their God .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursuers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
yes , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful blasphemies ;
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and didn 't withhold your manna from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" yes , forty years you sustained them in the wilderness . they lacked nothing . their clothes didn 't grow old , and their feet didn 't swell .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
now those who sealed were : Nehemiah the governor , the son of Hacaliah , and Zedekiah ,
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts in the other cities .
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
all the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty @-@ eight valiant men .
and their brothers , mighty men of valor , one hundred twenty @-@ eight ; and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of Haggedolim .
of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chiefs of the Levites , who had the oversight of the outward business of God 's house ;
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns , and in Dibon and its towns , and in Jekabzeel and its villages ,
Jeshua became the father of Joiakim , and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib , and Eliashib became the father of Joiada ,
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the purification , and so did the singers and the porters , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
now before this , Eliashib the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tobiah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frankincense .
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don 't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observances .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
thus I cleansed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites , everyone in his work ;
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment ;
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
after these things , when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
there was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Esther was doing , and what would become of her .
so Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
then the king 's servants , who were in the king 's gate , said to Mordecai , " Why do you disobey the king 's commandment ? "
when Haman saw that Mordecai didn 't bow down , nor pay him Homage , Haman was full of wrath .
the king said to Haman , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
the couriers went forth in haste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa . the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was perplexed .
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
Esther 's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly grieved . she sent clothing to Mordecai , to replace his sackcloth ; but he didn 't receive it .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then the king said , " Bring Haman quickly , so that it may be done as Esther has said . " so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Courier on horseback , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the couriers who rode on royal horses went out , hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
on that day , the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
and the Sabeans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh .
so Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his grief was very great .
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terrify it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
because it didn 't shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why didn 't I die from the womb ? why didn 't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me ?
for now should I have lain down and been quiet . I should have slept , then I would have been at rest ,
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mourn are exalted to safety .
you shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn 't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
Isn 't it that I have no help in me , That wisdom is driven quite from me ?
" to him who is ready to faint , kindness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Toss and turn until the dawning of the day .
why do you not pardon my disobedience , and take away my iniquity ? for now shall I lie down in the dust . you will seek me diligently , but I shall not be . "
behold , he goes by me , and I don 't see him . he passes on also , but I don 't perceive him .
if it is a matter of strength , behold , he is mighty ! if of justice , ' Who , ' says he , ' will summon me ? '
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and cheer up ; '
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
although you know that I am not wicked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! for true wisdom has two sides . know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves .
if iniquity is in your hand , put it far away . Don 't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents .
surely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Yes , you shall be steadfast , and shall not fear :
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
also you shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid . yes , many shall court your favor .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . yes , who doesn 't know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
who doesn 't know that in all these , the hand of Yahweh has done this ,
behold , he breaks down , and it can 't be built again . he imprisons a man , and there can be no release .
behold , he Withholds the waters , and they dry up . again , he sends them out , and they overturn the earth .
he removes the speech of those who are trusted , and takes away the understanding of the elders .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also flees like a shadow , and doesn 't continue .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can 't pass ;
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
so man lies down and doesn 't rise . until the heavens are no more , they shall not awake , nor be roused out of their sleep .
" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
the waters wear the stones . the torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth . so you destroy the hope of man .
his sons come to honor , and he doesn 't know it . they are brought low , but he doesn 't perceive it of them .
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor .
he wanders abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness . the flame shall dry up his branches . by the breath of God 's mouth shall he go away .
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gnashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpens his eyes on me .
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his archers surround me . he splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he pours out my gall on the ground .
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the worm , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts . he shall be brought to the king of terrors .
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his . sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation .
he has walled up my way so that I can 't pass , and has set darkness in my paths .
those who dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
I call to my servant , and he gives me no answer . I beg him with my mouth .
my breath is offensive to my wife . I am loathsome to the children of my own mother .
but as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives . in the end , he will stand upon the earth .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . yes , he shall be chased away like a vision of the night .
he has swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again . God will cast them out of his belly .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
for he has oppressed and forsaken the poor . he has violently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him .
all darkness is laid up for his treasures . an unfanned fire shall devour him . it shall consume that which is left in his tent .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ?
you say , ' God lays up his iniquity for his children . ' let him recompense it to himself , that he may know it .
you haven 't given water to the weary to drink , and you have withheld bread from the hungry .
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn 't see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
saying , ' surely those who rose up against us are cut off . the fire has consumed their remnant . '
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall shine on your ways .
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
my foot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I haven 't gone back from the commandment of his lips . I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face .
from out of the populous city , men groan . the soul of the wounded cries out , yet God doesn 't regard the Folly .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don 't know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
the womb shall forget him . the worm shall feed sweetly on him . he shall be no more remembered . Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree .
far be it from me that I should justify you . until I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
for it hurls at him , and does not spare , as he flees away from his hand .
he breaks open a Shaft away from where people live . they are forgotten by the foot . they hang far from men , they swing back and forth .
he binds the streams that they don 't trickle . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
he establishes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
the voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth .
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commended me :
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me , and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I was a father to the needy . the cause of him who I didn 't know , I searched out .
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any defilement has stuck to my hands ,
then let me sow , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
for that would be a heinous crime . yes , it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges :
" if I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant , when they contended with me ;
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade , and my arm be broken from the bone .
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
( yes , I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse ) ;
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .
" behold , I waited for your words , and I listened for your reasoning , while you searched out what to say .
yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Job , or who answered his words , among you .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed . I will open my lips and answer .
for I don 't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
" surely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , in slumbering on the bed ;
for the work of a man he will render to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the afflicted .
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righteousness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? '
if you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? if your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
how much less when you say you don 't see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
he doesn 't preserve the life of the wicked , but gives to the afflicted their right .
he doesn 't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
but if they don 't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fatness .
for he says to the snow , ' Fall on the earth ; ' likewise to the shower of rain , and to the showers of his mighty rain .
it is turned around by his guidance , that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world ,
now men don 't see the light which is bright in the skies , but the wind passes , and clears them .
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the wilderness , in which there is no man ;
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
will you confide in him , that he will bring home your seed , and gather the grain of your threshing floor ?
on the cliff he dwells , and makes his home , on the point of the cliff , and the stronghold .
pour out the fury of your anger . look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low .
behold , the hope of him is in vain . won 't one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can 't be pulled apart .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can 't be moved .
you asked , ' Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand , things too wonderful for me , which I didn 't know .
blessed is the man who doesn 't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ;
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . whatever he does shall prosper .
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take counsel together , against Yahweh , and against his Anointed , saying ,
give sincere Homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish in the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . blessed are all those who take refuge in him .
< < A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . > > Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side .
arise , Yahweh ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
< < For the Chief Musician , with the flutes . a Psalm by David . > > Give ear to my words , Yahweh . consider my meditation .
Yahweh , in the morning you shall hear my voice . in the morning I will lay my requests before you , and will watch expectantly .
but as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
< < For the Chief Musician ; on stringed instruments , upon the eight @-@ stringed Lyre . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your anger , neither discipline me in your wrath .
if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me ( yes , if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary ) ,
let the enemy pursue my soul , and overtake it ; yes , let him tread my life down to the earth , and lay my glory in the dust . Selah .
the trouble he causes shall return to his own head . his violence shall come down on the crown of his own head .
when I consider your heavens , the work of your fingers , the moon and the stars , which you have ordained ;
< < For the Chief Musician . set to " The Death of the Son . " a Psalm by David . > > I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart . I will tell of all your marvelous works .
the nations have sunk down in the pit that they made . in the net which they hid , their own foot is taken .
his ways are prosperous at all times . he is haughty , and your laws are far from his sight . as for all his adversaries , he sneers at them .
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
Yahweh , you have heard the desire of the humble . you will prepare their heart . you will cause your ear to hear ,
< < For the Chief Musician . by David . > > In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
for , behold , the wicked bend their bows . they set their arrows on the strings , that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart .
Yahweh is in his holy temple . Yahweh is on his throne in heaven . his eyes observe . his eyes examine the children of men .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > How long , Yahweh ? will you forget me forever ? how long will you hide your face from me ?
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on Yahweh ?
he who doesn 't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ;
in whose eyes a vile man is despised , but who honors those who fear Yahweh ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts , and doesn 't change ;
he who doesn 't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god . their drink offerings of blood I will not offer , nor take their names on my lips .
I have set Yahweh always before me . because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
< < A Prayer by David . > > Hear , Yahweh , my righteous plea ; Give ear to my prayer , that doesn 't go out of deceitful lips .
as for the works of men , by the word of your lips , I have kept myself from the ways of the violent .
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
in my distress I called on Yahweh , and cried to my God . he heard my voice out of his temple . my cry before him came into his ears .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yahweh is tried . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
you have also given me the shield of your salvation . your right hand sustains me . your gentleness has made me great .
I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . they shall fall under my feet .
you have delivered me from the strivings of the people . you have made me the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me . the foreigners shall submit themselves to me .
he rescues me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > The heavens declare the glory of God . the expanse shows his handiwork .
their voice has gone out through all the earth , their words to the end of the world . in them he has set a tent for the sun ,
his going forth is from the end of the heavens , his circuit to its ends ; There is nothing hidden from its heat .
keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . let them not have dominion over me . then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble . May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high ,
for the king trusts in Yahweh . through the loving kindness of the Most High , he shall not be moved .
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall devour them .
I am poured out like water . all my bones are out of joint . my heart is like wax ; it is melted within me .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd . my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . you have brought me into the dust of death .
I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the assembly , I will praise you .
for he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted , Neither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cried to him , he heard .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing .
even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for you are with me . your rod and your staff , they comfort me .
you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . you anoint my head with oil . my cup runs over .
< < A Psalm by David . > > The earth is Yahweh 's , with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein .
my God , I have trusted in you . Don 't let me be shamed . Don 't let my enemies triumph over me .
Don 't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your Goodness ' sake , Yahweh .
< < By David . > > Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering .
< < By David . > > Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
though an army should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear . though war should rise against me , even then I will be confident .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me . I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to Yahweh .
Don 't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , for false witnesses have risen up against me , such as breathe out cruelty .
Yahweh is my strength and my shield . my heart has trusted in him , and I am helped . therefore my heart greatly rejoices . with my song I will thank him .
< < A Psalm . a Song for the Dedication of the Temple . by David . > > I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me .
Yahweh , you have brought up my soul from Sheol . you have kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
you have turned my mourning into dancing for me . you have removed my sackcloth , and clothed me with gladness ,
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . you have known my soul in adversities .
you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy . you have set my feet in a large place .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me .
Oh how great is your Goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
I acknowledged my sin to you . I didn 't hide my iniquity . I said , I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh , and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
for this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him .
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go . I will counsel you with my eye on you .
Don 't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you .
Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing . he makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect .
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart , and saves those who have a crushed spirit .
< < By David . > > contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . fight against those who fight against me .
let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor . let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
all my bones shall say , " Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? "
Don 't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me ; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes .
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
< < For the Chief Musician . by David , the servant of Yahweh . > > An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : " there is no fear of God before his eyes . "
he plots iniquity on his bed . he sets himself in a way that is not good . he doesn 't abhor evil .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house . you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures .
Don 't let the foot of pride come against me . Don 't let the hand of the wicked drive me away .
< < By David . > > Don 't fret because of evildoers , neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness .
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
for yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . yes , though you look for his place , he isn 't there .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
they shall not be disappointed in the time of evil . in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
for such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . those who are Cursed by him shall be cut off .
but he passed away , and behold , he was not . yes , I sought him , but he could not be found .
< < A Psalm by David , for a memorial . > > Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
my heart throbs . my strength fails me . as for the light of my eyes , it has also left me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > I waited patiently for Yahweh . he turned to me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . he set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh .
blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn 't respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it . let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil .
Yahweh will preserve him , and keep him alive . he shall be blessed on the earth , and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies .
yes , my own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , who ate bread with me , has lifted up his heel against me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a contemplation by the sons of Korah . > > As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God .
Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime . in the night his song shall be with me : a prayer to the God of my life .
for you are the God of my strength . why have you rejected me ? why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
through you , will we push down our adversaries . through your name , will we tread them under who rise up against us .
yes , for your sake we are killed all day long . we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter .
< < For the Chief Musician . by the sons of Korah . according to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term . > > God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore we won 't be afraid , though the earth changes , though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas ;
there is a river , the streams of which make the city of God glad , the holy place of the tents of the Most High .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . he burns the chariots in the fire .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Oh clap your hands , all you nations . shout to God with the voice of triumph !
< < A Song . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , is Mount Zion , on the north sides , the city of the great King .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Hear this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
they are appointed as a flock for Sheol . death shall be their shepherd . the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning . their beauty shall decay in Sheol , far from their mansion .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > The mighty One , God , Yahweh , speaks , and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset .
he calls to the heavens above , to the earth , that he may judge his people :
if I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world is mine , and all that is in it .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
whoever offers the sacrifice of Thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
against you , and you only , have I sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah .
but as for me , I am like a green olive tree in God 's house . I trust in God 's loving kindness forever and ever .
I will give you thanks forever , because you have done it . I will hope in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your saints .
every one of them has gone back . they have become filthy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don 't call on God ?
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven 't set God before them . Selah .
because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . for they bring suffering on me . in anger they hold a grudge against me .
behold , then I would wander far off . I would lodge in the wilderness . " Selah .
in God , I praise his word . in God , I put my trust . I will not be afraid . what can flesh do to me ?
for you have delivered my soul from death , and prevented my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living .
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
my soul is among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Do Not Destroy . " a poem by David . > > Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ?
let them be like a snail which melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun .
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter .
they shall wander up and down for food , and wait all night if they aren 't satisfied .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . for a stringed instrument . by David . > > Hear my cry , God . listen to my prayer .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthan . a Psalm by David . > > My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
but those who seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the Goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
< < For the Chief Musician . a song . a Psalm . > > Make a joyful shout to God , all the earth !
you allowed men to ride over our heads . we went through fire and through water , but you brought us to the place of abundance .
< < For the Chief Musician . with stringed instruments . a Psalm . a song . > > May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away . as wax melts before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
the chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands . the Lord is among them , from Sinai , into the sanctuary .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
to him who rides on the heaven of heavens , which are of old ; behold , he utters his voice , a mighty voice .
< < For the Chief Musician . to the tune of " Lilies . " by David . > > Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don 't let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
Don 't let the flood waters overwhelm me , neither let the deep swallow me up . Don 't let the pit shut its mouth on me .
reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
they also gave me gall for my food . in my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink .
be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go . give the command to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress .
I have relied on you from the womb . you are he who took me out of my mother 's womb . I will always praise you .
my mouth will tell about your righteousness , and of your salvation all day , though I don 't know its full measure .
I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh . I will make mention of your righteousness , even of yours alone .
yes , even when I am old and gray @-@ haired , God , don 't forsake me , until I have declared your strength to the next generation , your might to everyone who is to come .
you , who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . you will bring us up again from the depths of the earth .
my tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long , for they are disappointed , and they are confounded , who want to harm me .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
they shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . men shall pray for him continually . they shall bless him all day long .
< < A Psalm by Asaph . > > surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > God , why have you rejected us forever ? why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ?
remember your Congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
Don 't forget the voice of your adversaries . the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
for in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup , full of foaming wine mixed with spices . he pours it out . indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs .
< < For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a Psalm by Asaph . a song . > > In Judah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
there he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah .
< < For the Chief Musician . to Jeduthun . a Psalm by Asaph . > > My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and didn 't get tired . my soul refused to be comforted .
the voice of your Thunder was in the whirlwind . the lightnings lit up the world . the earth trembled and shook .
< < A contemplation by Asaph . > > Hear my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
we will not hide them from their children , telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh , his strength , and his wondrous works that he has done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
he made a path for his anger . he didn 't spare their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ,
he also drove out the nations before them , allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
we have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and derision to those who are around us .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you ; on the kingdoms that don 't call on your name ;
Don 't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us . let your tender mercies speedily meet us , for we are in desperate need .
why should the nations say , " Where is their God ? " let it be known among the nations , before our eyes , that vengeance for your servants ' blood is being poured out .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
he appointed it in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out over the land of Egypt , I heard a language that I didn 't know .
I am Yahweh , your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . open your mouth wide , and I will fill it .
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
they don 't know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
< < A song . a Psalm by Asaph . > > God , don 't keep silent . Don 't keep silent , and don 't be still , God .
< < For the Chief Musician . on an instrument of Gath . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies !
yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by the sons of Korah . > > Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
< < A Psalm by the sons of Korah ; a Song . > > His foundation is in the holy mountains .
I am counted among those who go down into the pit . I am like a man who has no help ,
set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can 't escape .
< < A contemplation by Ethan , the Ezrahite . > > I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .
a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones , to be feared above all those who are around him ?
before the mountains were brought forth , before you had formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , you are God .
for all our days have passed away in your wrath . we bring our years to an end as a sigh .
satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness , that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
let the favor of the Lord our God be on us ; establish the work of our hands for us ; yes , establish the work of our hands .
he will call on me , and I will answer him . I will be with him in trouble . I will deliver him , and honor him .
he who implanted the ear , won 't he hear ? he who formed the eye , won 't he see ?
for he is our God . we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep in his care . today , oh that you would hear his voice !
therefore I swore in my wrath , " They won 't enter into my rest . "
< < A Psalm . > > sing to Yahweh a new song , for he has done marvelous things ! his right hand , and his holy arm , have worked salvation for him .
he has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel . all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
know that Yahweh , he is God . it is he who has made us , and we are his . we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
< < A Psalm by David . > > I will sing of loving kindness and justice . to you , Yahweh , I will sing praises .
I will set no vile thing before my eyes . I hate the deeds of Faithless men . they will not cling to me .
my eyes will be on the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me . he who walks in a perfect way , he will serve me .
he who practices deceit won 't dwell within my house . he who speaks falsehood won 't be established before my eyes .
morning by morning , I will destroy all the wicked of the land ; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh 's city .
Don 't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
you will arise and have mercy on Zion ; for it is time to have pity on her . yes , the set time has come .
they will perish , but you will endure . yes , all of them will wear out like a garment . you will change them like a cloak , and they will be changed .
he makes his messengers winds ; his servants flames of fire .
he causes the grass to grow for the livestock , and plants for man to cultivate , that he may bring forth food out of the earth :
you hide your face : they are troubled ; you take away their breath : they die , and return to the dust .
I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live . I will sing praise to my God while I have any being .
and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute ; to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
our fathers didn 't understand your wonders in Egypt . they didn 't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses , but were rebellious at the sea , even at the Red Sea .
he rebuked the Red Sea also , and it was dried up ; so he led them through the depths , as through a desert .
he saved them from the hand of him who hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Moses , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , so that he wouldn 't destroy them .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . the land was polluted with blood .
and gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .
they mount up to the sky ; they go down again to the depths . their soul melts away because of trouble .
they reel back and forth , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people , and praise him in the seat of the elders .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > God of my praise , don 't remain silent ,
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh . Don 't let the sin of his mother be blotted out .
yes , he loved cursing , and it came to him . he didn 't delight in blessing , and it was far from him .
I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth . yes , I will praise him among the multitude .
for he will stand at the right hand of the needy , to save him from those who judge his soul .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth .
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same , Yahweh 's name is to be praised .
he raises up the poor out of the dust . lifts up the needy from the ash heap ;
not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .
Yahweh remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
because he has turned his ear to me , therefore I will call on him as long as I live .
open to me the gates of righteousness . I will enter into them . I will give thanks to Yah .
blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh ! we have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh .
Don 't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth , for I put my hope in your ordinances .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . he answered me .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > I will lift up my eyes to the hills . where does my help come from ?
< < A Song of Ascents . > > To you I do lift up my eyes , you who sit in the heavens .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , with the contempt of the proud .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , let Israel now say ,
our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler 's snare . the snare is broken , and we have escaped .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion , which can 't be moved , but remains forever .
for the scepter of wickedness won 't remain over the allotment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won 't use their hands to do evil .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to stay up late , eating the bread of toil ; for he gives sleep to his loved ones .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh , who walks in his ways .
for you will eat the labor of your hands . you will be happy , and it will be well with you .
your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the innermost parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table .
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up . let Israel now say ,
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Out of the depths I have cried to you , Yahweh .
Yahweh has sworn to David in truth . he will not turn from it : " I will set the fruit of your body on your throne .
< < A Song of Ascents . by David . > > See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity !
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
< < A Song of Ascents . > > Look ! praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh 's house !
praise Yah ! praise the name of Yahweh ! praise him , you servants of Yahweh ,
who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth ; who makes lightnings with the rain ; who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries ;
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down . yes , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don 't remember you ; if I don 't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy .
< < By David . > > I will give you thanks with my whole heart . before the gods , I will sing praises to you .
I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth ; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all .
for though Yahweh is high , yet he looks after the lowly ; but the proud , he knows from afar .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , you will revive me . you will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies . your right hand will save me .
< < For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , you have searched me , and you know me .
if I ascend up into heaven , you are there . if I make my bed in Sheol , behold , you are there !
your eyes saw my body . in your book they were all written , the days that were ordained for me , when as yet there were none of them .
if I would count them , they are more in number than the sand . when I wake up , I am still with you .
as for the head of those who surround me , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Yahweh , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
Don 't incline my heart to any evil thing , to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity . Don 't let me eat of their delicacies .
their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock . they will hear my words , for they are well spoken .
for my eyes are on you , Yahweh , the Lord . in you , I take refuge . Don 't leave my soul destitute .
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me , from the traps of the workers of iniquity .
< < A contemplation by David , when he was in the cave . a Prayer . > > I cry with my voice to Yahweh . with my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , you knew my path . in the way in which I walk , they have hidden a snare for me .
look on my right , and see ; for there is no one who is concerned for me . refuge has fled from me . no one cares for my soul .
bring my soul out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name . the righteous will surround me , for you will be good to me .
< < A Psalm by David . > > Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
hurry to answer me , Yahweh . my spirit fails . Don 't hide your face from me , so that I don 't become like those who go down into the pit .
< < By David . > > blessed be Yahweh , my rock , who teaches my hands to war , and my fingers to battle :
Yahweh is near to all those who call on him , to all who call on him in truth .
he will fulfill the desire of those who fear him . he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
Don 't put your trust in princes , each a son of man in whom there is no help .
May the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ;
I also will laugh at your disaster . I will mock when calamity overtakes you ;
he lays up sound wisdom for the upright . he is a shield to those who walk in integrity ;
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don 't withhold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
when you go , your steps will not be hampered . when you run , you will not stumble .
Don 't enter into the path of the wicked . Don 't walk in the way of evil men .
for they don 't sleep , unless they do evil . their sleep is taken away , unless they make someone fall .
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
you are trapped by the words of your mouth . you are ensnared with the words of your mouth .
when you walk , it will lead you . when you sleep , it will watch over you . when you awake , it will talk with you .
I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry , with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt .
beside the gates , at the entry of the city , at the entry doors , she cries aloud :
when he established the heavens , I was there ; when he set a circle on the surface of the deep ,
when he gave to the sea its boundary , that the waters should not violate his commandment , when he marked out the foundations of the earth ;
she has prepared her meat . she has mixed her wine . she has also set her table .
instruct a wise man , and he will be still wiser . teach a righteous man , and he will increase in learning .
Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry , but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked .
he who gathers in summer is a wise son , but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame .
wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment , but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding .
the way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright , but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity .
one who brings gossip betrays a confidence , but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret .
a gracious woman obtains honor , but violent men obtain riches .
those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh , but those whose ways are blameless are his delight .
there is one who scatters , and increases yet more . there is one who Withholds more than is appropriate , but gains poverty .
the words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood , but the speech of the upright rescues them .
a man shall be commended according to his wisdom , but he who has a warped mind shall be despised .
better is he who is lightly esteemed , and has a servant , than he who honors himself , and lacks bread .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth . the work of a man 's hands shall be rewarded to him .
there are some who pretend to be rich , yet have nothing . there are some who pretend to be poor , yet have great wealth .
good understanding wins favor ; but the way of the unfaithful is hard .
a good man leaves an inheritance to his children 's children , but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous .
in the multitude of people is the king 's glory , but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince .
he who is slow to anger has great understanding , but he who has a quick temper displays Folly .
the king 's favor is toward a servant who deals wisely , but his wrath is toward one who causes shame .
when a man 's ways please Yahweh , he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him .
how much better it is to get wisdom than gold ! yes , to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver .
one who winks his eyes to plot perversities , one who compresses his lips , is bent on evil .
one who is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; one who rules his spirit , than he who takes a city .
he who justifies the wicked , and he who condemns the righteous , both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh .
wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding , but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth .
even a fool , when he keeps silent , is counted wise . when he shuts his lips , he is thought to be discerning .
one who is Slack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction .
a man 's stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth . with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied .
it isn 't good to have zeal without knowledge ; nor being hasty with one 's feet and missing the way .
the fear of Yahweh leads to life , then contentment ; he rests and will not be touched by trouble .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
the terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion . he who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life .
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter ; therefore he shall beg in harvest , and have nothing .
Don 't love sleep , lest you come to poverty . open your eyes , and you shall be satisfied with bread .
it is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication , then later to consider his vows .
whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor , he will also cry out , but shall not be heard .
the man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it .
for it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you , if all of them are ready on your lips .
Don 't you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are collateral for debts .
why do you set your eyes on that which is not ? for it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky .
Don 't look at the wine when it is red , when it sparkles in the cup , when it goes down smoothly .
yes , you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea , or as he who lies on top of the rigging :
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don 't feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
rescue those who are being led away to death ! indeed , hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter !
so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
Don 't rejoice when your enemy falls . Don 't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown ;
for there will be no reward to the evil man ; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out .
Don 't say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . "
I went by the field of the sluggard , by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
behold , it was all grown over with thorns . its surface was covered with nettles , and its stone wall was broken down .
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to those who send him ; for he refreshes the soul of his masters .
have you found honey ? eat as much as is sufficient for you , lest you eat too much , and vomit it .
if your enemy is hungry , give him food to eat . if he is thirsty , give him water to drink :
like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint .
like the legs of the lame that hang loose : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as one who binds a stone in a sling , so is he who gives honor to a fool .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish . he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth .
Don 't forsake your friend and your father 's friend . Don 't go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
he who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning , it will be taken as a curse by him .
though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain , yet his foolishness will not be removed from him .
there will be plenty of goats ' milk for your food , for your family 's food , and for the nourishment of your servant girls .
better is the poor who walks in his integrity , than he who is perverse in his ways , and he is rich .
one who works his land will have an abundance of food ; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty .
whoever robs his father or his mother , and says , " It 's not wrong . " he is a partner with a destroyer .
if a wise man goes to court with a foolish man , the fool rages or scoffs , and there is no peace .
whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul . he takes an oath , but dares not testify .
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Who is Yahweh ? ' or lest I be poor , and steal , and so dishonor the name of my God .
there is a generation whose teeth are like swords , and their jaws like knives , to devour the poor from the earth , and the needy from among men .
" the eye that mocks at his father , and scorns obedience to his mother : the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , the young eagles shall eat it .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maiden .
for as the churning of milk brings forth butter , and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
it is not for kings , Lemuel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes to say , ' Where is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and behold , all is vanity and a chasing after wind .
that which is crooked can 't be made straight ; and that which is lacking can 't be counted .
therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun .
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that wickedness was there .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him who is alone when he falls , and doesn 't have another to lift him up .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools , for they don 't know that they do evil .
Don 't be rash with your mouth , and don 't let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
for as a dream comes with a multitude of cares , so a fool 's speech with a multitude of words .
when you vow a vow to God , don 't defer to pay it ; for he has no pleasure in fools . pay that which you vow .
Don 't allow your mouth to lead you into sin . Don 't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eats little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep .
this also is a grievous evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go . and what profit does he have who labors for the wind ?
for what advantage has the wise more than the fool ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
Don 't be hasty in your spirit to be angry , for anger rests in the bosom of fools .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , and in the day of adversity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of vanity : there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don 't withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that wickedness is stupidity , and that foolishness is madness .
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hardness of his face is changed .
for he doesn 't know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the wicked buried . indeed they came also from holiness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow ; because he doesn 't fear God .
when I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes ) ,
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don 't know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their envy has perished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in Sheol , where you are going .
yes also , when the fool walks by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fool .
he who digs a pit may fall into it ; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of nobles , and your princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
Don 't curse the king , no , not in your thoughts ; and don 't curse the rich in your bedroom : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has wings may tell the matter .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
he who observes the wind won 't sow ; and he who regards the clouds won 't reap .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don 't withhold your hand ; for you don 't know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him rejoice in them all ; but let him remember the days of darkness , for they shall be many . all that comes is vanity .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are darkened ,
before the silver cord is severed , or the golden bowl is broken , or the pitcher is broken at the spring , or the wheel broken at the cistern ,
Don 't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven 't kept my own vineyard .
if you don 't know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the sheep . Graze your young goats beside the shepherds ' tents .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he glances through the lattice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the flowers appear on the earth . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land .
the fig tree ripens her green figs . the vines are in blossom . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " Lover
my dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn 't find him .
he made its pillars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of purple , its midst being paved with love , from the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . Lover
your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is bereaved among them .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense .
you have ravished my heart , my sister , my bride . you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your neck .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices !
your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
I have taken off my robe . indeed , must I put it on ? I have washed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
I rose up to open for my beloved . my hands dripped with myrrh , my fingers with liquid myrrh , on the handles of the lock .
the watchmen who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bruised me . the keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me .
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . your hair is like a flock of goats , that lie along the side of Gilead .
I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower .
how beautiful are your feet in sandals , prince 's daughter ! your rounded thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a skillful workman .
Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruct me . I would have you drink spiced wine , of the juice of my pomegranate .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
many waters can 't quench love , neither can floods drown it . if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be utterly scorned . friends
we have a little sister . she has no breasts . what shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ?
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it : wounds , welts , and open sores . they haven 't been closed , neither bandaged , neither soothed with oil .
your country is desolate . your cities are burned with fire . Strangers devour your land in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , like a hut in a field of melons , like a besieged city .
unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant , we would have been as Sodom ; we would have been like Gomorrah .
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
your princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don 't judge the fatherless , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yahweh 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hills ; and all nations shall flow to it .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
enter into the rock , and hide in the dust , from before the terror of Yahweh , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man will be brought low , the haughtiness of men will be bowed down , and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clothing , you be our ruler , and let this ruin be under your hand . "
Woe to the wicked ! disaster is upon them ; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him .
moreover Yahweh said , " Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes , walking to trip as they go , jingling ornaments on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion , and Yahweh will make their scalps bald . "
it will happen , that he who is left in Zion , and he who remains in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem ;
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be trampled down .
Woe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
Woe to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inflames them !
the harp , Lyre , tambourine , and flute , with wine , are at their feasts ; but they don 't respect the work of Yahweh , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire , and opened its mouth without measure ; and their glory , their multitude , their pomp , and he who rejoices among them , descend into it .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him hasten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come speedily and swiftly .
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea . if one looks to the land behold , darkness and distress . the light is darkened in its clouds .
the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called , and the house was filled with smoke .
then one of the seraphim flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
and Yahweh has removed men far away , and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
" let 's go up against Judah , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its midst , even the son of Tabeel . "
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
Yahweh will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
it will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the desolate valleys , in the clefts of the rocks , on all Thorn hedges , and on all pastures .
in that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of Assyria , the head and the hair of the feet ; and it shall also consume the beard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels , shall be for briers and thorns .
all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe , you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of sheep . "
now therefore , behold , the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River : the king of Assyria and all his glory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
take counsel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" Don 't say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terrorized .
Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dread .
I will wait for Yahweh , who hides his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies , who dwells in Mount Zion .
they will pass through it , very distressed and hungry ; and it will happen that when they are hungry , they will worry , and curse by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces upward ,
the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has shined .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spares his brother .
Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers who write oppressive decrees ;
what will you do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which will come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
therefore the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , will send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard bearer faints .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his yoke from off your neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil .
the Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him : the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh .
his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
the wolf will live with the lamb , and the Leopard will lie down with the young goat ; The calf , the young lion , and the fattened calf together ; and a little child will lead them .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse , who stands as a banner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be glorious .
he will set up a banner for the nations , and will assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim will depart , and those who persecute Judah will be cut off . Ephraim won 't envy Judah , and Judah won 't persecute Ephraim .
behold , God is my salvation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Yah , Yahweh , is my strength and song ; and he has become my salvation . "
set up a banner on the bare mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my consecrated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
the noise of a multitude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together ! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even Yahweh , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
behold , the day of Yahweh comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a desolation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light . the sun will be darkened in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to shine .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible .
therefore I will make the heavens tremble , and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies , and in the day of his fierce anger .
it will happen that like a hunted gazelle , and like sheep that no one gathers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be ransacked , and their wives raped .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not delight in it .
their bows will dash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb . their eyes will not spare children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
for Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreigner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jacob .
it will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
your pomp is brought down to Sheol , with the sound of your stringed instruments . Maggots are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will ascend into heaven ! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of evildoers will not be named forever .
prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers , that they not rise up and possess the earth , and fill the surface of the world with cities .
" I will also make it a possession for the porcupine , and pools of water . I will sweep it with the Broom of destruction , " says Yahweh of Armies .
Yahweh of Armies has sworn , saying , " surely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and tread him under foot on my mountains . then his yoke will leave them , and his burden leave their shoulders .
the firstborn of the poor will eat , and the needy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remnant will be killed .
they have gone up to Bayith , and to Dibon , to the high places , to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba . Baldness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
Heshbon cries out with Elealeh . their voice is heard even to Jahaz . therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud . their souls tremble within them .
my heart cries out for Moab ! her nobles flee to Zoar , to Eglath Shelishiyah ; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping ; for in the way of Horonaim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of Nimrim will be desolate ; for the grass has withered away , the tender grass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Brook of the willows .
for it will be that as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon .
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his boastings are nothing .
therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah . I will water you with my tears , Heshbon , and Elealeh : for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen .
it will happen that when Moab presents himself , when he wearies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken . they will be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Yahweh of Armies .
" it will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh will become lean .
it will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat , and his arm reaps the grain . yes , it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim .
in that day , people will look to their Maker , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the altars , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made , either the Asherim , or the incense altars .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blossom , but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the uproar of many peoples , who roar like the roaring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
at evening , behold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who plunder us , and the lot of those who rob us .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trumpet is blown , listen !
for before the harvest , when the blossom is over , and the flower becomes a ripening grape , he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the charmers , those who have familiar spirits , and the wizards .
the rivers will become foul . the streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up . the reeds and flags will wither away .
the princes of Zoan have become fools . the princes of Memphis are deceived . they have caused Egypt to go astray , who are the cornerstone of her tribes .
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works , like a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies , which he determines against it .
in that day , there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to Yahweh at its border .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria ; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
you are my threshing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " Within a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the glory of Kedar will fail ,
and the residue of the number of the archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , will be few ; for Yahweh , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
he took away the covering of Judah ; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and I will clothe him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the pitchers .
the burden of Tyre . Howl , you ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the merchants of Sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the kingdoms . Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan 's strongholds .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth .
for it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples , as the shaking of an olive tree , as the gleanings when the vintage is done .
the earth will stagger like a drunken man , and will sway back and forth like a hammock . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the earth on the earth .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
Yahweh , you are my God . I will exalt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faithfulness and truth .
as the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers ; as the heat by the shade of a cloud , the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
for in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest . Moab will be trodden down in his place , even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill .
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swims spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
for he has brought down those who dwell on high , the lofty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the dust .
yes , in the way of your judgments , Yahweh , have we waited for you . your name and your renown are the desire of our soul .
with my soul have I desired you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly ; for when your judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully , and will not see Yahweh 's majesty .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in pain and cries out in her pangs ; so we have been before you , Yahweh .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yourself for a little moment , until the indignation is past .
in days to come , Jacob will take root . Israel will blossom and bud . they will fill the surface of the world with fruit .
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a habitation deserted and forsaken , like the wilderness . the calf will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim , and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine !
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in .
when he has leveled its surface , doesn 't he plant the dill , and scatter the cumin seed , and put in the wheat in rows , the barley in the appointed place , and the spelt in its place ?
for the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin ; but the dill is beaten out with a stick , and the cumin with a rod .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be threshing it . although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it , his horses don 't grind it .
I will encamp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
but the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
for Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep , and has closed your eyes , the prophets ; and he has covered your heads , the seers .
Isn 't it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the deaf will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh , and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant .
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain , and like a banner on a hill .
for the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem . you will weep no more . he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your ears will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver , and the plating of your molten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an unclean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
the oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender , which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
there shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of Yahweh comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a devouring fire .
his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction ; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Yahweh will lay on him , will be with the sound of tambourines and harps . he will fight with them in battles , brandishing weapons .
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of those who work iniquity .
for in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the ears of those who hear will listen .
at the noise of the Thunder , the peoples have fled . when you lift yourself up , the nations are scattered .
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can 't comprehend , with a strange language that you can 't understand .
their slain will also be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree .
the wild oxen will come down with them , and the young bulls with the mighty bulls ; and their land will be drunken with blood , and their dust made greasy with fat .
it won 't be quenched night nor day . its smoke will go up forever . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it forever and ever .
but the pelican and the porcupine will possess it . the owl and the raven will dwell in it . he will stretch the line of confusion over it , and the Plumb line of emptiness .
they shall call its nobles to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
thorns will come up in its palaces , nettles and thistles in its fortresses ; and it will be a habitation of jackals , a court for ostriches .
the wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves , and the wild goat will cry to his fellow . yes , the night creature shall settle there , and shall find herself a place of rest .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , Hatch , and gather under her shade . yes , the kites will be gathered there , every one with her Mate .
it will blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Carmel and Sharon . they will see Yahweh 's glory , the excellence of our God .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah , and captured them .
the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army . he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller 's field highway .
I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebelled against me ?
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
Don 't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh , saying , " Yahweh will surely deliver us . this city won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . " '
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , " Yahweh will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth , and went into Yahweh 's house .
he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
he heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , ' Don 't let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won 't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . "
have the gods of the nations delivered them , which my fathers have destroyed , Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the children of Eden who were in Telassar ?
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it . then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh 's house , and spread it before Yahweh .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you defied and blasphemed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yahweh .
the angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and eighty @-@ five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
" go , and tell Hezekiah , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yahweh , that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul .
behold , for peace I had great anguish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
the living , the living , he shall praise you , as I do this day . the father shall make known your truth to the children .
Yahweh will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh .
now Isaiah had said , " Let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a poultice on the boil , and he shall recover . "
at that time , Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
'Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Yahweh .
'They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned , that she has received of Yahweh 's hand double for all her sins . "
behold , the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him .
he will feed his flock like a shepherd . he will gather the lambs in his arm , and carry them in his bosom . he will gently lead those who have their young .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard , yet ? haven 't you been told from the beginning ? haven 't you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
it is he who sits above the circle of the earth , and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers ; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain , and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in ;
they are planted scarcely . they are sown scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wither , and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble .
haven 't you known ? haven 't you heard ? the everlasting God , Yahweh , The Creator of the ends of the earth , doesn 't faint . he isn 't weary . his understanding is unsearchable .
but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eagles . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
behold , all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
you will seek them , and won 't find them , even those who contend with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @-@ existent thing .
for I , Yahweh your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' Don 't be afraid . I will help you . '
you will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whirlwind will scatter them . you will rejoice in Yahweh . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers on the bare heights , and springs in the midst of the valleys . I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
behold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who chooses you is an abomination .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no counselor who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
" behold , my servant , whom I uphold ; my chosen , in whom my soul delights-- I have put my Spirit on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not shout , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won 't break a bruised Reed . he won 't quench a dimly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
" I , Yahweh , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a Covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that Kedar inhabits . let the inhabitants of Sela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
Yahweh will go out like a mighty man . he will stir up zeal like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will shout aloud . he will triumph over his enemies .
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
who is there among you who will give ear to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scorch you .
since you have been precious and honored in my sight , and I have loved you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
Don 't be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yahweh , " and I am God .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don 't you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jackals and the ostriches ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wearied you with frankincense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wearied me with your iniquities .
I , even I , am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sins .
for I will pour water on him who is thirsty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
this is what Yahweh , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , Yahweh of Armies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the workmen are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
the blacksmith takes an axe , works in the coals , fashions it with hammers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hungry , and his strength fails ; he drinks no water , and is faint .
he cuts down cedars for himself , and takes the Cypress and the oak , and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a fir tree , and the rain nourishes it .
they don 't know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can 't see ; and their hearts , that they can 't understand .
he feeds on ashes . a deceived heart has turned him aside ; and he can 't deliver his soul , nor say , " Isn 't there a lie in my right hand ? "
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , your transgressions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have redeemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the rough places smooth . I will break the doors of brass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yahweh , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have surnamed you , though you have not known me .
I am Yahweh , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yahweh , and there is no one else .
thus says Yahweh , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , confounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
" assemble yourselves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image , and pray to a god that can 't save .
I have sworn by myself , the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and will not return , that to me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall take an oath .
they will say of me , ' There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh . ' " even to him shall men come ; and all those who were incensed against him shall be disappointed .
" listen to me , house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , that have been borne from their birth , that have been carried from the womb ;
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed , I will also do it .
your nakedness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
I was angry with my people , I profaned my inheritance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mercy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
they are created now , and not from of old ; and before this day you didn 't hear them ; lest you should say , ' behold , I knew them . '
for my name 's sake will I defer my anger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand has spread out the heavens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
" come near to me and hear this : " from the beginning I have not spoken in secret ; from the time that it was , there am I. " Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me , with his Spirit .
thus says Yahweh , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yahweh your God , who teaches you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
they didn 't thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
behold , these shall come from far ; and behold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim . "
" for , as for your waste and your desolate places , and your land that has been destroyed , surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who swallowed you up shall be far away .
I gave my back to the strikers , and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair ; I didn 't hide my face from shame and spitting .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Yahweh will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yahweh , who obeys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yahweh , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Yahweh : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
look to Abraham your father , and to Sarah who bore you ; for when he was but one I called him , and I blessed him , and made him many .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my righteousness shall be forever , and my salvation to all generations . "
Isn 't it you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over ?
the captive exile shall speedily be freed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
the voice of your watchmen ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yahweh returns to Zion .
Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
for you shall not go out in haste , neither shall you go by flight : for Yahweh will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of dry ground . he has no good looks or majesty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
after the suffering of his soul , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their iniquities .
" enlarge the place of your tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations ; don 't spare : lengthen your cords , and strengthen your stakes .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your seed shall possess the nations , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my Covenant of peace be removed , " says Yahweh who has mercy on you .
I will make your pinnacles of rubies , and your gates of Sparkling jewels , and all your walls of precious stones .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Yahweh , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and doesn 't return there , but waters the earth , and makes it bring forth and bud , and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
blessed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yahweh , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it , and holds fast my Covenant ;
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shepherds who can 't understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
you were wearied with the length of your way ; yet you didn 't say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you weren 't faint .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the lips : peace , peace , to him who is far off and to him who is near , " says Yahweh ; " and I will heal them . "
" cry aloud , don 't spare , lift up your voice like a trumpet , and declare to my people their disobedience , and to the house of Jacob their sins .
behold , you fast for strife and contention , and to strike with the fist of wickedness : you don 't fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth speedily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard .
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obscurity be as the noonday ;
behold , Yahweh 's hand is not shortened , that it can 't save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can 't hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
the way of peace they don 't know ; and there is no justice in their goings : they have made them crooked paths ; whoever goes therein does not know peace .
we grope for the wall like the blind ; yes , we grope as those who have no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the twilight ; among those who are lusty we are as dead men .
for our transgressions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us , and as for our iniquities , we know them :
yes , truth is lacking ; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey . Yahweh saw it , and it displeased him that there was no justice .
he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his own arm brought salvation to him ; and his righteousness , it upheld him .
he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a mantle .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
" foreigners shall build up your walls , and their kings shall minister to you : for in my wrath I struck you , but in my favor have I had mercy on you .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Yahweh , am your Savior , and your Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
but you shall be named the priests of Yahweh ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will boast in their glory .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed . "
for as the earth brings forth its bud , and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Yahweh shall name .
you shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh , and a royal diadem in the hand of your God .
behold , Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth , " Say to the daughter of Zion , ' behold , your salvation comes . behold , his reward is with him , and his recompense before him . ' "
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
I trod down the peoples in my anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth . "
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
when you did awesome things which we didn 't look for , you came down , the mountains quaked at your presence .
you meet him who rejoices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sinned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
for we have all become as one who is unclean , and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment : and we all fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , take us away .
but now , Yahweh , you are our Father ; we are the clay , and you our Potter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
" I am inquired of by those who didn 't ask ; I am found by those who didn 't seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create ; for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus says Yahweh , " Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for by fire will Yahweh execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many .
" for as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yahweh , " so your seed and your name shall remain .
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
then Yahweh put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and Yahweh said to me , " behold , I have put my words in your mouth .
the word of Yahweh came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling caldron ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your belt on your waist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . Don 't be dismayed at them , lest I dismay you before them .
" for my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
" haven 't you procured this to yourself , in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God , when he led you by the way ?
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ;
" but where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah .
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . surely his anger has turned away from me . ' " behold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sinned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be ashamed of Egypt also , as you were ashamed of Assyria .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
I said after she had done all these things , ' She will return to me ; ' but she didn 't return ; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
it happened through the lightness of her prostitution , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
only acknowledge your iniquity , that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Yahweh . "
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
a voice is heard on the bare heights , the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel ; because they have perverted their way , they have forgotten Yahweh their God .
truly in vain is help from the hills , the tumult on the mountains . truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God .
and you shall swear , ' As Yahweh lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us ! for we are ruined .
" for my people are foolish , they don 't know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers ; they go into the thickets , and climb up on the rocks : every city is forsaken , and not a man dwells therein .
the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
shepherds with their flocks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yahweh . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superficially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
Don 't go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
for if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even forevermore .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yahweh .
but go now to my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yahweh , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you didn 't hear ; and I called you , but you didn 't answer :
for I didn 't speak to your fathers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
for the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Yahweh : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the earth ; and none shall frighten them away .
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yahweh of Armies .
I listened and heard , but they didn 't speak aright : no man repents him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle .
yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don 't know Yahweh 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Yahweh ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mourn ; dismay has taken hold on me .
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit iniquity .
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceit : one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the peoples are vanity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman with the axe .
but Yahweh is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trembles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
every man has become brutish and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of Yahweh : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
the voice of news , behold , it comes , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah a desolation , a dwelling place of jackals .
then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing , even altars to burn incense to Baal .
Yahweh called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it , and its branches are broken .
therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remnant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
but you , Yahweh , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have forsaken my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourns to me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man lays it to heart .
Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
it shall happen , after that I have plucked them up , I will return and have compassion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a cleft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yahweh said to me , arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
but if you will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall weep bitterly , and run down with tears , because Yahweh 's flock is taken captive .
say to the king and to the queen mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headdresses have come down , even the crown of your glory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Judah is carried away captive , all of it ; it is wholly carried away captive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
if you say in your heart , Why are these things come on me ? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered , and your heels suffer violence .
because of the ground which is cracked , because no rain has been in the land , the plowmen are disappointed , they cover their heads .
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
I didn 't sit in the assembly of those who make merry , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible .
for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
and you have done evil more than your fathers ; for , behold , you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , so that you don 't listen to me :
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes .
first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things , and have filled my inheritance with their abominations .
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is engraved on the tablet of their heart , and on the horns of your altars ;
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
Yahweh , the hope of Israel , all who forsake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken Yahweh , the spring of living waters .
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day holy , neither do any work : but make the Sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the Potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incense to false gods ; and they have been made to stumble in their ways , in the ancient paths , to walk in byways , in a way not built up ;
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them ; for they have dug a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the gate Harsith , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you ;
then came Jeremiah from Topheth , where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Yahweh 's house , and said to all the people :
now Pashhur , the son of Immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
but , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
Cursed is the day in which I was born : Don 't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed .
let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew , and didn 't repent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and shouting at noontime ;
because he didn 't kill me from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and doesn 't give him his hire ;
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you didn 't obey my voice .
I will cast you out , and your mother who bore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel ? is he a vessel in which none delights ? why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into the land which they don 't know ?
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
I will set up shepherds over them , who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yahweh .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that they shall no more say , As Yahweh lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their visitation , says Yahweh .
they say continually to those who despise me , Yahweh has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say , No evil shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yahweh , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth . yes , a whirling storm . it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers forgot my name for Baal .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
one basket had very good figs , like the figs that are first @-@ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yahweh : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Yahweh 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yahweh had sent me :
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Thus says Yahweh of Armies : you shall surely drink .
Wail , you shepherds , and cry ; and wallow in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goodly vessel .
the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word from Yahweh , saying ,
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh , Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim ; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant .
for they prophesy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
Don 't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy a lie to you .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
( after that Jeconiah the king , the queen mother , the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the Smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , to all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
for thus says Yahweh , After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
thus says Yahweh of Armies ; behold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that can 't be eaten , they are so bad .
because they have not listened to my words , says Yahweh , with which I sent to them my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yahweh .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incurable : for the greatness of your iniquity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of Yahweh will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus , You have chastised me , and I was chastised , as an untrained calf : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yahweh my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yahweh .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own iniquity : every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar .
and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yahweh : though you fight with the Chaldeans , you shall not prosper ?
so I took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
Ah Lord Yahweh ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Yahweh of Armies is his name ;
who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yourself a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
therefore thus says Yahweh : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
yes , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
thus says Yahweh of Armies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yahweh our righteousness .
Don 't consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yahweh chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
the word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , saying ,
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
but we have lived in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh ,
then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
they were not afraid , nor tore their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the scroll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take again another scroll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned .
Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king , instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Yahweh , which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah .
Pharaoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house , and into the cells , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
where now are your prophets who prophesied to you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh : and the king said to Jeremiah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then you shall tell them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah .
the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , to Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
and said to him , Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life ? but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn 't believe them .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
now therefore hear the word of Yahweh , O remnant of Judah : thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
however I sent to you all my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them , saying , Oh , don 't do this abominable thing that I hate .
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky , and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Put , who handle the shield ; and the Ludim , who handle and bend the bow .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
they cried there , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he has let the appointed time pass by .
the sound of it shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cutters .
for by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up ; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
Moab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Yahweh of Armies .
judgment has come on the plain country , on Holon , and on Jahzah , and on Mephaath ,
you inhabitants of Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Moab . he is very proud ; his loftiness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the haughtiness of his heart .
from the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim , to Eglath Shelishiyah : for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate .
moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , says Yahweh , him who offers in the high place , and him who burns incense to his gods .
on all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where ; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights , says Yahweh .
Kerioth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
flee , turn back , dwell in the depths , inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him , the time that I shall visit him .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
I have heard news from Yahweh , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , Gather yourselves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
the earth trembles at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise which is heard in the Red Sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
Damascus has grown feeble , she turns herself to flee , and trembling has seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her , as of a woman in travail .
their tents and their flocks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
they shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it , saying , Come , and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting Covenant that shall not be forgotten .
my people have been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the male goats before the flocks .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who plunder my heritage , because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain , and neigh as strong horses ;
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly desolate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of Assyria devoured him ; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Yahweh , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
Yahweh has opened his armory , and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans .
kill all her bulls ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe to them ! for their day has come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day , says Yahweh .
the proud one shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all who are around him .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engraved images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax feeble : anguish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall winnow her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
for Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah , of his God , of Yahweh of Armies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh 's hand , who made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
he has made the earth by his power , he has established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens :
every man has become brutish without knowledge . every goldsmith is disappointed by his image ; for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tribe of his inheritance : Yahweh of Armies is his name .
you are my battle axe and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy kingdoms ;
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Medes , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dominion .
the land trembles and is in pain ; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without inhabitant .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Yahweh .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
though Babylon should mount up to the sky , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall destroyers come to her , says Yahweh .
for Yahweh lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
and say , Yahweh , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall dwell therein , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be desolate forever .
Zedekiah was twenty @-@ one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chaldeans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty @-@ two persons ;
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are desolate , her priests do sigh : her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she didn 't remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down wonderfully ; she has no comforter : see , Yahweh , my affliction ; for the enemy has magnified himself .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
for these things I weep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
let all their wickedness come before you ; Do to them , as you have done to me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
he has cut off in fierce anger all the Horn of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , which devours all around .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
they tell their mothers , Where is grain and wine ? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their soul is poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your iniquity , to bring back your captivity , but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me desolate .
it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
you will render to them a recompense , Yahweh , according to the work of their hands .
how the gold has become dim ! the most pure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street .
even the jackals draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ; They were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was as of sapphire .
their appearance is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin clings to their bones ; it is withered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yahweh has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations .
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can 't touch their garments .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
they hunt our steps , so that we can 't go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky : they chased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
we have given the hand to the Egyptians , To the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus :
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl : and the four of them had one likeness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse , like the awesome crystal to look on , stretched forth over their heads above .
there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard @-@ hearted .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
go to them of the captivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv , that lived by the river Chebar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
yet if you warn the wicked , and he doesn 't turn from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but you have delivered your soul .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all your abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
your doom has come to you , inhabitant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of tumult , and not of joyful shouting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your abominations .
they shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be on all faces , and baldness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall profane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the plain .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of creeping things , and abominable animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they didn 't turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they didn 't turn as they went .
when the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the wheels also didn 't turn from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me , and he said to me , Speak , Thus says Yahweh : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep my ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
then the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophesies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
they have seen falsehood and lying divination , who say , Yahweh says ; but Yahweh has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
haven 't you seen a false vision , and haven 't you spoken a lying divination , in that you say , Yahweh says ; but I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one builds up a wall , behold , they plaster it with whitewash :
tell those who plaster it with whitewash , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and you , great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall tear it .
behold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it ?
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
if the prophet is deceived and speak a word , I , Yahweh , have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yahweh .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they ravage it , and it be made desolate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has devoured both its ends , and its midst is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
and say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite ; the Amorite was your father , and your mother was a Hittite .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
when I passed by you , and saw you wallowing in your blood , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Though you are in your blood , live .
then washed I you with water ; yes , I thoroughly washed away your blood from you , and I anointed you with oil .
I decked you with ornaments , and I put bracelets on your hands , and a chain on your neck .
your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty ; for it was perfect , through my majesty which I had put on you , says the Lord Yahweh .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were wallowing in your blood .
you have built your lofty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an abomination , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multiplied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
you have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians , because you were insatiable ; yes , you have played the prostitute with them , and yet you weren 't satisfied .
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chaldea ; and yet you weren 't satisfied with this .
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and thrust you through with their swords .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , Sodom your sister has not done , she nor her daughters , as you have done , you and your daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither has Samaria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
and he took of the seed royal , and made a Covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
for he has despised the oath by breaking the Covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
what do you mean , that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
who has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , has not defiled his neighbor 's wife ,
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , robbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , behold , he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he has done he shall live .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , in which you have transgressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the abominations of his eyes , and don 't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Yahweh your God .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
I gave them my statutes , and showed them my ordinances , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ordinances , and didn 't walk in my statutes , and profaned my Sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless my eye spared them , and I didn 't destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness .
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant ;
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I swore to give to your fathers .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh .
then I said , Ah Lord Yahweh ! they say of me , Isn 't he a speaker of parables ?
and tell the land of Israel , Thus says Yahweh : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mirth ? the rod of my son , it condemns every tree .
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stumblings be multiplied : ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight , who have sworn oaths to them ; but he brings iniquity to memory , that they may be taken .
I will overturn , overturn , overturn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to defile her !
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yahweh , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will scatter you among the nations , and disperse you through the countries ; and I will consume your filthiness out of you .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
yes , I will gather you , and blow on you with the fire of my wrath , and you shall be melted in its midst .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Yahweh , have poured out my wrath on you .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yahweh .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the choicest men of Assyria all of them ; and on whoever she doted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a byword among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
her sister Oholibah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her prostitution , remembering the days of her youth , in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt .
she doted on their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decorate yourself with ornaments ,
they went in to her , as they go in to a prostitute : so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
Righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she didn 't pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mourn nor weep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your headdress on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don 't cover your lips , and don 't eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
your tires shall be on your heads , and your shoes on your feet : you shall not mourn nor weep ; but you shall pine away in your iniquities , and moan one toward another .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : because you have clapped your hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and revenged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethites , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
it happened in the eleventh year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh , behold , I am against you , Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make forts against you , and cast up a mound against you , and raise up the buckler against you .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your departure .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars ; they have made your benches of Ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the islands of Kittim .
of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning .
the men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around , and valorous men were in your towers ; they hanged their shields on your walls all around ; they have perfected your beauty .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith , and confections , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
these were your traffickers in choice wares , in wrappings of blue and embroidered work , and in chests of rich clothing , bound with cords and made of cedar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise : and you were replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bald for you , and clothe them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
when your wares went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters , your merchandise and all your company fell in your midst .
by your great wisdom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your riches , and your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until unrighteousness was found in you .
for I will send pestilence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
for the day is near , even the day of Yahweh is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
a sword shall come on Egypt , and anguish shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
thus says Yahweh : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
they shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great anguish , and No shall be broken up ; and Memphis [ shall have ] adversaries in the daytime .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @-@ like shade , and of high stature ; and its top was among the thick boughs .
the waters nourished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plantation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh : because you are exalted in stature , and he has set his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
on his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yahweh : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of you .
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of animals trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
it happened also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
they shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all their multitude ; their graves are around them ; all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army , slain by the sword , says the Lord Yahweh .
then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet , and doesn 't take warning , if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and didn 't take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
none of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him : he has done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yahweh , when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment , because of all their abominations which they have committed .
they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth ; and there was none who searched or sought .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I myself , even I , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yahweh , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not hated blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its slain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall who are slain with the sword .
you have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : I have sworn , [ saying ] , surely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be tilled and sown ;
and I will multiply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity .
therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they profaned my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yahweh , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations , where they went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
I will put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and you shall keep my ordinances , and do them .
you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your uncleanness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sinews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , an earthquake ; and the bones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , behold , there were sinews on them , and flesh came up , and skin covered them above ; but there was no breath in them .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yahweh , have spoken it and performed it , says Yahweh .
my servant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my ordinances , and observe my statutes , and do them .
you shall ascend , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cloud to cover the land , you , and all your hordes , and many peoples with you .
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yahweh : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
I will set my glory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them ; and I hid my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Jealous for my holy name .
they shall bear their shame , and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
every lodge was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lodges was five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one Reed .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its posts , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @-@ five cubits ; door against door .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
there was a gate to the inner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits .
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
and its lodges , and its posts , and its arches , according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in its arches all around ; it was fifty cubits long , and twenty @-@ five cubits broad .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side room , four cubits , all around the house on every side .
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length ninety cubits .
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cubits .
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
for they were in three stories , and they didn 't have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the uppermost ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits , and the breadth a cubit .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall also take the bull of the sin offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanctuary .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
you shall bring them near to Yahweh , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
thus says the Lord Yahweh , No foreigner , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
they shall have linen tires on their heads , and shall have linen breeches on their waists ; they shall not clothe themselves with [ anything that causes ] sweat .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordinances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts ; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy .
in the day that he goes into the sanctuary , into the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yahweh .
of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in breadth ] , square all around ; and fifty cubits for its suburbs all around .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a Homer : its measure shall be after the Homer .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a Homer of barley ;
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who errs , and for him who is simple : so you shall make Atonement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fourteenth day of the month , you shall have the Passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh , seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a male goat daily for a sin offering .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram ; they shall be without blemish :
and he shall prepare a meal offering , an ephah for the bull , and an ephah for the ram , and for the lambs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the prince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ankles .
afterward he measured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed through .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] portions .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer Hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side southward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath . this is the west side .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok , who have kept my instruction , who didn 't go astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
in every matter of wisdom and understanding , concerning which the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm .
in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king answered the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if you don 't make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
he changes the times and the seasons ; he removes kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
you , O king , saw , and behold , a great image . this image , which was mighty , and whose brightness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was awesome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory ;
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things ; and as iron that crushes all these , shall it break in pieces and crush .
the king answered to Daniel , and said , Of a truth your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was sixty cubits , and its breadth six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
and whoever doesn 't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its height reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the earth .
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached to the sky , and its sight to all the earth ;
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dominion to the end of the earth .
whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree ; your kingdom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
Peres ; your kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which doesn 't alter .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a Leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands ministered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
the male goat magnified himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great Horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the glorious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and trampled on them .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me upright .
the rough male goat is the king of Greece : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances ;
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his petitions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and behold , a man clothed in linen , whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
then he said , " Do you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia . when I go forth , behold , the prince of Greece shall come .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
after the treaty made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses ; and a god whom his fathers didn 't know shall he honor with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse ; and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
many shall purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
blessed is he who waits , and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty @-@ five days .
Yahweh said to him , " Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thorns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can 't find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the grain , the new wine , and the oil , and multiplied to her silver and gold , which they used for Baal .
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will betroth you to me forever . yes , I will betroth you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ephod or idols .
hear the word of Yahweh , you children of Israel ; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
you will stumble in the day , and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the prostitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh .
my people consult with their wooden idol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray , and they have been unfaithful to their God .
the wind has wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices .
their deeds won 't allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don 't know Yahweh .
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke . among the tribes of Israel , I have made known that which will surely be .
" come , and let us return to Yahweh ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will heal us ; he has injured us , and he will bind up our wounds .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets ; I killed them with the words of my mouth . your judgments are like a flash of lightning .
when I would heal Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , also the wickedness of Samaria ; for they commit falsehood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of robbers ravages outside .
they don 't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness . now their own deeds have engulfed them . they are before my face .
they are all adulterers . they are burning like an oven that the Baker stops stirring , from the kneading of the dough , until it is leavened .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them , as their Congregation has heard .
they haven 't cried to me with their heart , but they howl on their beds . they assemble themselves for grain and new wine . they turn away from me .
for they sow the wind , and they will reap the whirlwind . he has no standing grain . the stalk will yield no head . if it does yield , strangers will swallow it up .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
they won 't dwell in Yahweh 's land ; but Ephraim will return to Egypt , and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
what will you do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yahweh ?
a prophet watches over Ephraim with my God . a fowler 's snare is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
though they bring up their children , yet I will bereave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , woe also to them when I depart from them !
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
Ephraim is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit . according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars . as their land has prospered , they have adorned their sacred stones .
it also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king . Ephraim will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
when it is my desire , I will chastise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
you have plowed wickedness . you have reaped iniquity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle roar will arise among your people , and all your fortresses will be destroyed , as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle . the mother was dashed in pieces with her children .
I drew them with cords of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks ; and I bent down to him and I fed him .
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger . I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of you ; and I will not come in wrath .
they will walk after Yahweh , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children will come trembling from the west .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
" but I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
Jacob fled into the country of Aram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended flocks and herds .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor , and like the smoke out of the chimney .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted . therefore they have forgotten me .
I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will devour them like a lioness . the wild animal will tear them .
the sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him . he is an unwise son ; for when it is time , he doesn 't come to the opening of the womb .
Samaria will bear her guilt ; for she has rebelled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . "
Ephraim , what have I to do any more with idols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green fir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the fangs of a lioness .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fig tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
Sanctify a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yahweh , your God , and cry to Yahweh .
Yahweh , I cry to you , For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water brooks have dried up , And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , for the day of Yahweh comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they run like mighty men . they climb the wall like warriors . they each march in his line , and they don 't swerve off course .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
gather the people . Sanctify the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bridegroom go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
Yahweh answered his people , " behold , I will send you grain , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten , the great locust , the grasshopper , and the caterpillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Yahweh , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem ,
because you have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my finest treasures into your temples ,
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah , and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a faraway nation , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
" let the nations arouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
Yahweh will roar from Zion , and Thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
Egypt will be a desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
he said : " Yahweh will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn , and the top of Carmel will wither . "
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to Edom ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Tyre , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to Edom , and didn 't remember the brotherly Covenant ;
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it will devour its palaces , with shouting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the whirlwind ;
but I will send a fire on Moab , and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth ; and Moab will die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet ;
thus says Yahweh : " for three transgressions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
they trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same maiden , to profane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .

" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
it is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher , and the servant like his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more those of his household !
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the housetops .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he .
you , Capernaum , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to Hades . for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
but I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , on the day of judgment , than for you . "
take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and plunder his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will plunder his house .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
you offspring of vipers , how can you , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through waterless places , seeking rest , and doesn 't find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
others fell on rocky ground , where they didn 't have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
when anyone hears the word of the Kingdom , and doesn 't understand it , the evil one comes , and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart . this is what was sown by the roadside .
what was sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
then Jesus sent the multitudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field . "
the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
for Herod had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife .
the king was grieved , but for the sake of his oaths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he commanded it to be given ,
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pray . when evening had come , he was there alone .
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
you hypocrites ! well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
that which enters into the mouth doesn 't defile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
and he took the seven loaves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jonah . " he left them , and departed .
then they understood that he didn 't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , " Who do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
again , assuredly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven .
but because he couldn 't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
it happened when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
again I tell you , it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
" for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Isn 't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
the multitudes who went before him , and who followed kept shouting , " Hosanna to the son of David ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children who were crying in the temple and saying , " Hosanna to the son of David ! " they were indignant ,
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , and seize his inheritance . '
Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them , saying ,
'i am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
for they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
but he answered them , " You see all of these things , don 't you ? most certainly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone on another , that will not be thrown down . "
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there will be famines , plagues , and earthquakes in various places .
" when , therefore , you see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
he will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fig tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
I was naked , and you clothed me . I was sick , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' depart from me , you Cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " Sleep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes , " Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and you didn 't arrest me .
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists , and some slapped him ,
then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remorse , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
the chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It 's not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is the price of blood . "
when they had mocked him , they took the robe off of him , and put his clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
immediately one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him a drink .
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth quaked and the rocks were split .
now the centurion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Truly this was the Son of God . "
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , " rejoice ! " they came and took hold of his feet , and worshiped him .
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick , and those who were possessed by demons .
a leper came to him , begging him , kneeling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the Mat that the paralytic was lying on .
he arose , and immediately took up the Mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
it happened , that he was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
it happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields , and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of grain .
how he entered into God 's house when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wouldn 't press on him .
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder , unless he first binds the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house .
and it happened , as he sowed , some seed fell by the road , and the birds came and devoured it .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
for whoever has , to him will more be given , and he who doesn 't have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legion ; and they were afraid .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
but the woman , fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
they ridiculed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
but Herod , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I beheaded . he has risen from the dead . "
the king was exceedingly sorry , but for the sake of his oaths , and of his dinner guests , he didn 't wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring John 's head , and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
the Apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
Jesus came out , saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke the loaves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " cheer up ! it is I ! Don 't be afraid . "
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marveled ;
now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , they found fault .
( for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , don 't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms , holding to the tradition of the elders .
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
for Moses said , ' honor your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man .
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
she went away to her house , and found the child having been laid on the bed , with the demon gone out .
again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the region of Decapolis .
they brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech . they begged him to lay his hand on him .
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven loaves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don 't enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Whoever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
if your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire ,
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
for everyone will be salted with fire , and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt .
he arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan . multitudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
but when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said to them , " allow the little children to come to me ! Don 't forbid them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
they said to him , " Grant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your glory . "
when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , " Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! "
many spread their garments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
those who went in front , and those who followed , cried out , " Hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! "
he taught , saying to them , " Isn 't it written , ' My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? ' but you have made it a den of robbers ! "
when it was time , he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard .
again , he sent another servant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully treated .
Jesus answered them , " render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . " they marveled greatly at him .
for when they will rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet . " '
for nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . there will be earthquakes in various places . there will be famines and troubles . these things are the beginning of birth pains .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be hated by all men for my name 's sake , but he who endures to the end , the same will be saved .
then he will send out his angels , and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky .
" now from the fig tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception , and kill him .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "

a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high priest . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to tell him , " Prophesy ! " the officers struck him with the palms of their hands .
they compelled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .

the superscription of his accusation was written over him , " the King of the Jews . "
one ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a Reed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to take him down . "
when the centurion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , " Truly this man was the Son of God ! "
entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe , and they were amazed .
now when he had risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they didn 't believe those who had seen him after he had risen .

the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .

he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @-@ in @-@ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they begged him for her .

it happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God . with him were the twelve ,
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
those along the road are those who hear , then the devil comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved .
when Jesus stepped ashore , a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him . he wore no clothes , and didn 't live in a house , but in the tombs .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and begged him to come into his house ,
as many as don 't receive you , when you depart from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
for whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed , when he comes in his glory , and the glory of the Father , and of the holy angels .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently . but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they didn 't understand this saying . it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
but he turned and rebuked them , " You don 't know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man didn 't come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes , and the birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them . "
in the same way a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep knocking , and it will be opened to you .
or if he asks for an egg , he won 't give him a scorpion , will he ?
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
the unclean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
the lamp of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is evil , your body also is full of darkness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don 't know it . "
as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
" I tell you , my friends , don 't be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . therefore don 't be afraid . you are of more value than many sparrows .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith ?
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and knocks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them recline , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
whoever doesn 't bear his own cross , and come after me , can 't be my disciple .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ' rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . '
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight .
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble .
but who is there among you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
he said to the disciples , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
as it happened in the days of Noah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulfur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
you know the commandments : ' Don 't commit adultery , ' ' Don 't murder , ' ' Don 't steal , ' ' Don 't give false testimony , ' ' honor your father and your mother . ' "
for it is easier for a Camel to enter in through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
for I feared you , because you are an exacting man . you take up that which you didn 't lay down , and reap that which you didn 't sow . '
then why didn 't you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
for the days will come on you , when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , surround you , hem you in on every side ,
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you didn 't know the time of your visitation . "
he answered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
but he perceived their craftiness , and said to them , " Why do you test me ?
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
but that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
every day Jesus was teaching in the temple , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet .
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
for who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Isn 't it he who sits at the table ? but I am in the midst of you as one who serves .
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
when I was with you in the temple daily , you didn 't stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
when he found out that he was in Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem during those days .
when they came to the place that is called The skull , they crucified him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , from Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again ? "
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has declared him .
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , hereafter you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . "
after this , he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and they stayed there a few days .
he made a whip of cords , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables .
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this , and they believed the Scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in his name , observing his signs which he did .
Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
that which is born of the flesh is flesh . that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don 't receive our witness .
no one has ascended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
he who believes in him is not judged . he who doesn 't believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
the woman said to him , " I know that Messiah comes , " ( he who is called Christ ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
so when he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and begged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Your child lives ! "
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Yesterday at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate , there is a pool , which is called in Hebrew , " Bethesda , " having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of those who were sick , blind , lame , or paralyzed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sabbath .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who doesn 't honor the Son doesn 't honor the Father who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and doesn 't come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
" Don 't think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
after these things , Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
Jesus therefore , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had rowed about twenty @-@ five or thirty stadia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn 't there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thirsty .
all those whom the Father gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
this is the will of my Father who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
I am the living bread which came down out of heaven . if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don 't have life in yourselves .
as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he who feeds on me , he will also live because of me .
but there are some of you who don 't believe . " for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn 't believe , and who it was who would betray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my Father . "
now the feast of the Jews , the Feast of booths , was at hand .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
but of the multitude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Christ comes , he won 't do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
but he said this about the Spirit , which those believing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus wasn 't yet glorified .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham didn 't do this .
therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I haven 't come of myself , but he sent me .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
when he had said this , he spat on the ground , made mud with the saliva , anointed the blind man 's eyes with the mud ,
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
but how he now sees , we don 't know ; or who opened his eyes , we don 't know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
we know that God has spoken to Moses . but as for this man , we don 't know where he comes from . "
we know that God doesn 't listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshipper of God , and does his will , he listens to him .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who doesn 't enter by the door into the sheep fold , but climbs up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don 't know the voice of strangers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find pasture .
I have other sheep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one shepherd .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You blaspheme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secretly , saying , " The Teacher is here , and is calling you . "
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wouldn 't have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a stench , for he has been dead four days . "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
now the Passover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temple , " What do you think--that he isn 't coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might seize him .
then six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
Mary , therefore , took a pound of ointment of pure Nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
his disciples didn 't understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testifying about it .
most certainly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
if anyone listens to my sayings , and doesn 't believe , I don 't judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and doesn 't receive my sayings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
then he poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
I don 't speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . '
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going , you can 't come , ' so now I tell you .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it weren 't so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
he who doesn 't love me doesn 't keep my words . the word which you hear isn 't mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don 't let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can 't bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the vine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man doesn 't remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant doesn 't know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don 't know him who sent me .
if I hadn 't done among them the works which no one else did , they wouldn 't have had sin . but now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father .
" when the counselor has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I didn 't tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
most certainly I tell you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don 't say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
I came out from the Father , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . "
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of coals , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
they led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . it was early , and they themselves didn 't enter into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
then Pilate went out again , and said to them , " behold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
when Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pavement , " but in Hebrew , " Gabbatha . "
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Place of a skull , " which is called in Hebrew , " golgotha , "
Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " Jesus of NAZARETH , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
but there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping . so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
so when they got out on the land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @-@ three ; and even though there were so many , the net wasn 't torn .
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself wouldn 't have room for the books that would be written .
being assembled together with them , he commanded them , " Don 't depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which you heard from me .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Judea and Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth . "
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Akeldama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
yes , and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will prophesy .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
you made known to me the ways of life . you will make me full of gladness with your presence . '
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness . "
the kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Christ . '
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira , his wife , sold a possession ,
by the hands of the Apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
they agreed with him . summoning the Apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
but some of those who were of the synagogue called " The Libertines , " and of the Cyrenians , of the Alexandrians , and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose , disputing with Stephen .
then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and lived in Haran . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
and they were brought back to Shechem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sirs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their groaning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don 't know what has become of him . '
" our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness , even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen ;
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up steadfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
Saul was consenting to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except for the Apostles .
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them . they came out , crying with a loud voice . many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans .
now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . as a lamb before his shearer is silent , so he doesn 't open his mouth .
he commanded the chariot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away , and the eunuch didn 't see him any more , for he went on his way rejoicing .
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus . he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists , but they were seeking to kill him .
so the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened in those days that she fell sick , and died . when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
when the angel who spoke to him had departed , Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon .
now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
when it happened that Peter entered , Cornelius met him , fell down at his feet , and worshiped him .
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they also killed , hanging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
they of the circumcision who believed were amazed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles .
when I had looked intently at it , I considered , and saw the four @-@ footed animals of the earth , wild animals , creeping things , and birds of the sky .
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
the report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem . they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch ,
and he went out and followed him . he didn 't know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Herod had sought for him , and didn 't find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Judea to Caesarea , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Herod dressed himself in royal clothing , sat on the throne , and gave a speech to them .
now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
when they had gone through the island to Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar Jesus ,
but they , passing on from Perga , came to Antioch of Pisidia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
for those who dwell in Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they didn 't know him , nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
for so has the Lord commanded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gentiles , that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth . ' "
at Lystra a certain man sat , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Lycaonia , " The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! "
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes .
but when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they tore their clothes , and sprang into the multitude , crying out ,
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the assembly and the Apostles and the elders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why do you tempt God , that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but Paul didn 't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia , and didn 't go with them to do the work .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the Apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also , they came there likewise , agitating the multitudes .
now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignorance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwellings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained ; of which he has given assurance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Justus , one who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinthians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gallio didn 't care about any of these things .
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem , but I will return again to you if God Wills , " he set sail from Ephesus .
this man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
he began to speak boldly in the synagogue . but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
the whole city was filled with confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , having seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in confusion . most of them didn 't know why they had come together .
if therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . let them press charges against one another .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and eaten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he departed .
sailing from there , we came the following day opposite Chios . the next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium , and the day after we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
" now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Damascus , about noon , suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me .
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they didn 't understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when I couldn 't see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting to his death , and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " Rid the earth of this fellow , for he isn 't fit to live ! "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
he even tried to profane the temple , and we arrested him .
he ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove ,
but Festus , desiring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
when therefore they had come together here , I didn 't delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the goads . '
embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
when we had sailed slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus , the wind not allowing us further , we sailed under the Lee of Crete , opposite Salmone .
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the ship was caught , and couldn 't face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
after they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven along .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow ,
when it was day , they didn 't recognize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kindled a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cured .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three taverns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
when they didn 't agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
for I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yours and mine .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his everlasting power and divinity ; that they may be without excuse .
and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man , and of birds , and four @-@ footed animals , and creeping things .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
backbiters , hateful to God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who , knowing the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @-@ seeking , and don 't obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law . as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
for it isn 't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be justified
( for when Gentiles who don 't have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
you therefore who teach another , don 't you teach yourself ? you who preach that a man shouldn 't steal , do you steal ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a liar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prevail when you come into judgment . "
why not ( as we are slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
they have all turned aside . they have together become unprofitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in uncircumcision .
for if those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of no effect .
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he didn 't waver through unbelief , but grew strong through faith , giving glory to God ,
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope doesn 't disappoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bondservants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanctification , and the result of eternal life .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
for I don 't know what I am doing . for I don 't practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , I consent to the law that it is good .
for I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don 't find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don 't do ; but the evil which I don 't desire , that I practice .
but if what I don 't desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which dwells in me .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
for if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are children of God .
whom he predestined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also glorified .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
for he said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
as he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , who didn 't follow after righteousness , attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith ;
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
and how will they preach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace , who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he didn 't obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
and so all Israel will be saved . even as it is written , " There will come out of Zion the Deliverer , and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
Don 't be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @-@ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
if it is possible , as much as it is up to you , be at peace with all men .
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you despise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
Don 't overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating .
but I write the more boldly to you in part , as reminding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
yes , it has been their good pleasure , and they are their debtors . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ;
I commend to you Phoebe , our sister , who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae ,
now I beg you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doctrine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don 't serve our Lord , Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by their smooth and flattering speech , they deceive the hearts of the innocent .
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
we speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wisdom not of this world , nor of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
now the natural man doesn 't receive the things of God 's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can 't know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
for you are still fleshly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren 't you fleshly , and don 't you walk in the ways of men ?
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yours ,
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father 's wife .
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . for indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
Don 't you know that the saints will judge the world ? and if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
if then , you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
or don 't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one flesh . "
or don 't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife doesn 't have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband doesn 't have authority over his own body , but the wife .
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
were you called being a bondservant ? Don 't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? Don 't seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don 't seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from cares . he who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
so then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn 't give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
if to others I am not an Apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
but I have used none of these things , and I don 't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
but I beat my body and bring it into submission , lest by any means , after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don 't desire that you would have fellowship with demons .
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
but in giving you this command , I don 't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
when therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not the Lord 's Supper that you eat .
in the same way he also took the cup , after Supper , saying , " This cup is the new Covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
if the foot would say , " Because I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ;
if I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don 't have love , I am nothing .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
if then I don 't know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe .
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subjection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
for I am the least of the Apostles , who is not worthy to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn 't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
that which you sow , you don 't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own .
there is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory .
as is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
as we have borne the image of those made of dust , let 's also bear the image of the heavenly .
therefore let no one despise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
but I call God for a witness to my soul , that I didn 't come to Corinth to spare you .
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
for most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect , by reason of the glory that surpasses .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for most certainly in this we groan , longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven ;
for indeed we who are in this tent do groan , being burdened ; not that we desire to be unclothed , but that we desire to be clothed , that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
we are courageous , I say , and are willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . behold , all things have become new .
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as though God were entreating by us : we beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
great is my boldness of speech toward you . great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in all our affliction .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won 't by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident boasting .
now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food , supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ;
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints , but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God ;
while they themselves also , with supplication on your behalf , yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such are we also in deed when we are present .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
for we don 't stretch ourselves too much , as though we didn 't reach to you . for we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ ,
not boasting beyond proper limits in other men 's labors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different " good news " ;
and there isn 't another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to pervert the Good News of Christ .
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be Cursed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man preaches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cursed .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Good News which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God , and ravaged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Good News might continue with you .
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision , even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @-@ breaker .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
so that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bondservant , though he is lord of all ;
what was the blessing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
however , the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don 't use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption . but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don 't give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
as many as desire to look good in the flesh , they compel you to be circumcised ; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
for even they who receive circumcision don 't keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body .
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
but to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk , in the futility of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
let him who stole steal no more ; but rather let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are reproved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reveals is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Savior of the body .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one flesh . "
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing .
therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it will go with me .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
in nothing be anxious , but in everything , by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving , let your requests be made known to God .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
you yourselves also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
and through him to reconcile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ .
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in Thanksgiving .
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
if then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth .
for I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as Apostles of Christ .
even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
but we don 't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don 't grieve like the rest , who have no hope .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
but let us , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds ;
this is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
Don 't you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an Apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
but I don 't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness .
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
for bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
for this , I was appointed as a preacher , an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don 't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear .
traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ;
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to convict those who contradict him .
therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate ,
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
but which of the angels has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? "
God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ?
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold tightly to our confession .
the high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness .
so also Christ didn 't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear ,
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
in this way God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best spoils .
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them .
for if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
in that he says , " A new Covenant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away .
for a tabernacle was prepared . in the first part were the lampstand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place .
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshipper perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh :
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
but we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul .
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ,
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don 't grow weary , fainting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don 't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ;
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not children .
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ;
for they could not stand that which was commanded , " If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned " ;
this phrase , " Yet once more , " signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . "
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal Covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
but if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
for the sun arises with the scorching wind , and Withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits .
but each one is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn 't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man 's religion is worthless .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
for in many things we all stumble . if anyone doesn 't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don 't boast and don 't lie against the truth .
you adulterers and adulteresses , don 't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
you have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure . you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter .
Don 't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won 't be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn 't rain on the earth for three years and six months .
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
for this is the will of God , that by well @-@ doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed .
let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ;
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears open to their prayer ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
beloved , don 't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men 's matters .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don 't obey the Good News of God ?
when the chief shepherd is revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn 't fade away .
be sober and self @-@ controlled . be watchful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
Simon Peter , a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for if God didn 't spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to Tartarus , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly ;
having eyes full of adultery , and who can 't cease from sin ; enticing unsettled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing ;
for , uttering great swelling words of emptiness , they entice in the lusts of the flesh , by licentiousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware , lest being carried away with the error of the wicked , you fall from your own steadfastness .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sins , we have a counselor with the Father , Jesus Christ , the righteous .
one who says , " I know him , " and doesn 't keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth isn 't in him .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perfected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
but he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness , and doesn 't know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
I have not written to you because you don 't know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? this is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
my little children , let 's not love in word only , neither with the tongue only , but in deed and truth .
this is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , even as he commanded .
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
for there are three who testify :
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he listens to us .
and if we know that he listens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
we know that whoever is born of God doesn 't sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the evil one doesn 't touch him .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
this is love , that we should walk according to his commandments . this is the commandment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
watch yourselves , that we don 't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
if anyone comes to you , and doesn 't bring this teaching , don 't receive him into your house , and don 't welcome him ,
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
now I desire to remind you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who didn 't believe .
blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " Don 't be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands . the seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies . the seven lampstands are seven assemblies .
" to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things :
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God .
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
" to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write : " the Amen , the faithful and True Witness , the Head of God 's creation , says these things :
he who overcomes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
before the throne was something like a sea of glass , similar to crystal . in the midst of the throne , and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
no one in heaven above , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it had a bow . a crown was given to him , and he came forth conquering , and to conquer .
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
saying , " Don 't harm the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred forty @-@ four thousand , sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel :
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " salvation be to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the lamb ! "
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshiped God ,
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the lamb 's blood .
for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel 's hand .
the angel took the censer , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed thunders , sounds , lightnings , and an earthquake .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wormwood . " one third of the waters became wormwood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don 't have God 's seal on their foreheads .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
they have over them as king the angel of the abyss . his name in Hebrew is " Abaddon , " but in Greek , he has the name " Apollyon . "
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they didn 't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
they overcame him because of the lamb 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they didn 't love their life , even to death .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . Woe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the dragon grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her seed , who keep God 's commandments and hold Jesus ' testimony .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
here is wisdom . he who has understanding , let him calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred sixty @-@ six .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
the winepress was trodden outside of the city , and blood came out from the winepress , even to the bridles of the horses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadia .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
people were scorched with great heat , and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues . they didn 't repent and give him glory .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . they gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
the seventh poured out his bowl into the air . a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality , and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality . "
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amazement .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the cup which she mixed , mix to her double .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her , will weep and wail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth . "
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad , and let us give the glory to him . for the marriage of the lamb has come , and his wife has made herself ready . "
it was given to her that she would array herself in bright , pure , fine linen : for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " King of Kings , and Lord of lords . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
he seized the dragon , the old serpent , which is the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole inhabited earth , and bound him for a thousand years ,
and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
they went up over the breadth of the earth , and surrounded the camp of the saints , and the beloved city . fire came down out of heaven from God , and devoured them .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
its wall is one hundred forty @-@ four cubits , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to shine , for the very glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp is the lamb .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb ,
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
