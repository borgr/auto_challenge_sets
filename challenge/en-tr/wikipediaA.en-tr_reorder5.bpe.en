note : in this article the step by step ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal der@@ iv@@ ations will not be included , but will focus on the major equ@@ ations and concep@@ ts in vi@@ br@@ ation analysis .
this simple relation can be used to understand in general what will happen to a more complex system once we add mass or sti@@ ff@@ ness .
the mass then begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate because it is now com@@ pressing the spring and in the process transferring the kin@@ etic energy back to its potential .
in this simple model the mass will continue to os@@ cil@@ late fore@@ ver at the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de , but in a real system there is always d@@ amp@@ ing that dis@@ si@@ p@@ ates the energy , eventually bringing it to rest .
: formula _ 8@@ Sum@@ ming the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differ@@ ential equ@@ ation : : formula _ 9@@ The solution to this equ@@ ation depends on the amount of d@@ amp@@ ing .
if the d@@ amp@@ ing is increased just to the point where the system no longer os@@ cil@@ la@@ tes the point of critical d@@ amp@@ ing is reached ( if the d@@ amp@@ ing is increased past critical d@@ amp@@ ing the system is called over@@ d@@ amp@@ ed ) .
the plo@@ ts to the side present how 0.@@ 1 and 0.@@ 3 d@@ amp@@ ing rati@@ os effect how the system will " ring " down over time .
if the system can@@ not be changed , perhaps the forcing frequ@@ ency can be shif@@ ted ( for example , changing the speed of the machine gener@@ ating the force ) .
in other words , if energy is to be efficiently pum@@ ped into both the mass and spring the energy source needs to fe@@ ed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequ@@ ency .
applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on s@@ wing , a push is needed at the correct moment to make the s@@ wing get higher and higher .
in the case of our square wave force , the first component is actually a constant force of 0.5 new@@ ton and is represented by a value at " 0 " H@@ Z in the frequ@@ ency spectrum .
the remaining components are at od@@ d frequ@@ encies and it takes an in@@ fin@@ ite amount of sine waves to generate the perfect square wave .
hence , the Fo@@ ur@@ ier transform allows you to interpre@@ t the force as a sum of sin@@ us@@ o@@ id@@ al forces being applied instead of a more " complex " force ( e@@ .@@ g@@ .
in the previous section , the vi@@ br@@ ation solution was given for a single harmonic force , but the Fo@@ ur@@ ier transform will in general give multiple harmonic forces .
hence , the solution to the problem with a square wave is sum@@ ming the predicted vi@@ br@@ ation from each one of the harmonic forces found in the frequ@@ ency spectrum of the square wave .
this techni@@ que is used in the field of experim@@ ental mo@@ dal analysis to determine the vi@@ br@@ ation character@@ isti@@ cs of a structure .

for every possible state of the system , or allowed combination of values of the system 's parame@@ ters , a point is included in the multi@@ dimen@@ sional space .
as a whole , the phase di@@ ag@@ ram represents all that the system can be , and its shape can easily elu@@ ci@@ date qu@@ alities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise .
within the context of a model system in classical mechan@@ ics , the phase space co@@ ordin@@ ates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic vari@@ ables .
because of this , it is possible to calc@@ ulate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past , through integration of Ham@@ il@@ ton 's or Lag@@ range 's equ@@ ations of motion .
in this sense , a point in phase space is said to be a micro@@ state of the system .
for example , for a fixed temper@@ ature , the system could have many dynamic config@@ ur@@ ations at the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic level .
when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liqu@@ id phase , or solid phase , et@@ c .
since there are many more micro@@ states than mac@@ ro@@ states , the phase space in the first sense is usually a manif@@ old of much larger dimen@@ sions than the second sense .
clearly , many more parame@@ ters are required to register every detail of the system down to the mo@@ lec@@ ular or at@@ om@@ ic scale than to simply specify , say , the temper@@ ature or the pressure of the system .

there is even debate on whether it was a civil war or a revolution , or some combination of the two .

when Aug@@ ust@@ us became the first ru@@ ler of the Roman Empire in 31 BC , he decided such a formation was useful not only on the batt@@ le@@ field but in politics also .
finally in 101 their number was increased once more to ten , resulting in a force of 10,000 troops , whose status was at least elite .
for instance , a liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al may flow like a liqu@@ id , but its mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les may be oriented in a cr@@ y@@ st@@ al @@@ -@@ @ like way .
in 19@@ 65 , he organized the first international conference on liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ als , in Kent , O@@ hi@@ o , with about 100 of the world 's top liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al scientists in attendance .
this conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field , which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials .
an extended , struc@@ tur@@ ally ri@@ g@@ id , highly an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic shape seems to be the main criter@@ ion for liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ stal@@ line behavi@@ or , and as a result many liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ stal@@ line materials are based on benz@@ ene r@@ ings .
however some techniques , such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field , can be used to enforce a single ordered dom@@ ain in a mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al samp@@ le .
for instance , a particular type of L@@ C mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e ( called me@@ so@@ gen ) may exhibit various s@@ mec@@ tic and n@@ em@@ atic ( and finally is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic ) phases as temper@@ ature is increased .
thus , the mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les are free to flow and their cen@@ ter of mass positions are r@@ and@@ om@@ ly distributed as in a liqu@@ id , but still maintain their long @@@ -@@ @ range direc@@ tional order .
only ch@@ iral mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , those that have no internal planes of sym@@ me@@ try ) can give rise to such a phase .
in some liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al systems , the pit@@ ch is of the same order as the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of visible light .
Ch@@ iral dis@@ co@@ tic phases , similar to the ch@@ iral n@@ em@@ atic phase , are also known .
for instance , the concentrated prote@@ in solution that is ex@@ tru@@ ded by a sp@@ i@@ der to generate sil@@ k is , in fact , a liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al phase .
there are a number of fairly simple the@@ ories , however , that can at least predict the general behavi@@ or of the phase transi@@ tions in liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al systems .
for a typical liqu@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ al samp@@ le , S is on the order of 0.@@ 3 to 0.@@ 8 , and generally decreas@@ es as the temper@@ ature is raised .
as a result , it allows for a triple critical point where the n@@ em@@ atic , is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic , and s@@ mec@@ tic A phase meet .

these ideas eventually led to the creation , by James cler@@ k Max@@ well , of the first unified field theory in physi@@ cs with the introduction of equ@@ ations for the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
usually this is done by writing a Lag@@ ran@@ gian or a Ham@@ il@@ ton@@ ian of the field , and tre@@ ating it as the classical mechan@@ ics ( or qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics ) of a system with an in@@ fin@@ ite number of degrees of freedom .
the dynam@@ ics of a classical field are usually specified by the Lag@@ ran@@ gian den@@ s@@ ity in terms of the field components ; the dynam@@ ics can be obtained by using the action principle .
in a general setting , classical fields are described by sections of fi@@ ber bun@@ d@@ les and their dynam@@ ics is formu@@ lated in the terms of j@@ et manif@@ ol@@ ds ( c@@ ov@@ ar@@ i@@ ant classical field theory ) .
if there is a sym@@ me@@ try of the problem , not involving sp@@ ac@@ etime , under which these components transform into each other , then this set of sym@@ me@@ tries is called an " internal sym@@ me@@ try . "
when dealing carefully with classical fields at fin@@ ite temper@@ ature , the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal methods of continuous ran@@ dom fields are used , because ther@@ m@@ ally f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ating classical fields are no@@ where differ@@ enti@@ able .
the in@@ fin@@ ities are not well @@@ -@@ @ defined ; but the fin@@ ite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the fin@@ ite values , and that can be well @@@ -@@ @ defined .
the dimension of a v@@ ec@@ tor ordinary differ@@ ential equ@@ ation is simply the dimension of the v@@ ec@@ tor dependent vari@@ able , or the v@@ ec@@ tor function .
in this sense partial differ@@ ential equ@@ ations so can be thought of as ( coup@@ led ) O@@ DE@@ s of in@@ fin@@ ite dimension ( a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal interpre@@ tation of the degrees of freedom argument ) .
examples of such areas are spec@@ tral theory and harmonic analysis ( vi@@ br@@ ations and waves ) or the self @@@ -@@ @ descri@@ p@@ tive potential theory , all now ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal subjects in their own right .

the type of T cell activ@@ ated , and the type of response generated , depends , in part , on the context in which the A@@ PC first en@@ countered the anti@@ gen .
this af@@ fin@@ ity depends on the type and ori@@ entation of the anti@@ gen / M@@ H@@ C complex , and is what keeps the C@@ T@@ L and infected cell bound together .
the factors that dict@@ ate whether an infection will trigger a Th@@ 1 or Th@@ 2 type response are not fully understood , but the response generated does play an important role in the clear@@ ance of different path@@ o@@ gen@@ s .
in general , Th@@ 1 responses are more effective against in@@ tr@@ ac@@ el@@ lular path@@ o@@ gen@@ s ( vir@@ uses and bac@@ ter@@ ia that are inside host cells ) , whereas Th@@ 2 responses are more effective against extr@@ ac@@ el@@ lular bac@@ ter@@ ia , par@@ asi@@ tes including hel@@ min@@ ths and to@@ x@@ ins .

in classical statistical mechan@@ ics , the equi@@ partition the@@ o@@ rem is a general formula that rela@@ tes the temper@@ ature of a system with its average ener@@ gies .
like the vi@@ ri@@ al the@@ o@@ rem , it gives the total average kin@@ etic and potential ener@@ gies for a system at a given temper@@ ature , from which the system 's heat capacity can be compu@@ ted .
however , equi@@ partition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy , such as the kin@@ etic energy of a particular parti@@ cle or the potential energy of a single spring .
the equi@@ partition the@@ o@@ rem can be used to der@@ ive the ideal gas law , and the Dul@@ ong @@@ -@@ @ P@@ eti@@ t law for the specific heat capacities of sol@@ ids .
the equi@@ partition of kin@@ etic energy was proposed initially in 18@@ 43 , and more correc@@ tly in 18@@ 45 , by John James W@@ ater@@ ston .
in 18@@ 76 , Lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g Bol@@ t@@ z@@ mann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system .
in 18@@ 19 , the French physi@@ c@@ ists Pierre Louis Dul@@ ong and Alex@@ is Th@@ é@@ r@@ è@@ se P@@ eti@@ t discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temper@@ ature were in@@ ver@@ sely propor@@ tional to the at@@ om@@ ic weight of the element .
Ex@@ per@@ iment@@ ally , however , elec@@ tr@@ ons contribute little to the heat capacity : the mo@@ lar heat capacities of many conduc@@ tors and in@@ su@@ la@@ tors are nearly the same .
although equi@@ partition provides a simple der@@ iv@@ ation of the ideal @@@ -@@ @ gas law and the internal energy , the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the partition function .

in this way , our gender identity ( the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender ) and sexual ori@@ entation are program@@ med or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the w@@ om@@ b .

wh@@ en@@ ever a formula _ 60 is too large to be given exactly , the value of formula _ 62 is increased by 1 and everything to the right of formula _ 63 is re@@ written .

an electric car is an autom@@ obile that is pro@@ p@@ elled by one or more electric mo@@ tors , using electrical energy stored in re@@ char@@ ge@@ able bat@@ ter@@ ies or another energy storage device .

in some cases , the motor can be ho@@ used directly in the whe@@ el , such as in the W@@ his@@ per@@ ing W@@ he@@ el design , which low@@ ers the vehicle 's cen@@ ter of gra@@ vity and redu@@ ces the number of moving parts .
housing the motor within the whe@@ el can increase the un@@ sp@@ run@@ g weight of the whe@@ el , which can have an adver@@ se effect on the handling of the vehicle .
in a single car accident , and for the other car in a two car accident , the increased mass causes an increase in acceler@@ ations and hence an increase in the sever@@ ity of the accident .
the weight and type of vehicle , and the performance demands of the driver , also have an impact just as they do on the range of traditional vehicles .

studying an en@@ z@@ y@@ me 's k@@ ine@@ tics in this way can reveal the cataly@@ tic mechanism of this en@@ z@@ y@@ me , its role in met@@ abol@@ ism , how its activity is controlled , and how a drug or an ag@@ on@@ ist might in@@ hibi@@ t the en@@ z@@ y@@ me .
this rate @@@ -@@ @ determining step may be a chemical reaction or a con@@ form@@ ational change of the en@@ z@@ y@@ me or sub@@ stra@@ tes , such as those involved in the release of product ( s ) from the en@@ z@@ y@@ me .
the main difference between ri@@ boz@@ y@@ mes and en@@ z@@ y@@ mes is that R@@ NA cataly@@ sts are composed of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , whereas en@@ z@@ y@@ mes are composed of am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
kno@@ wing these properties suggests what an en@@ z@@ y@@ me might do in the cell and can show how the en@@ z@@ y@@ me will respond to changes in these conditions .
because en@@ z@@ y@@ mes are not consu@@ med by the reactions they cat@@ al@@ yse , en@@ z@@ y@@ me as@@ says usually follow changes in the concentration of either sub@@ stra@@ tes or products to measure the rate of reaction .
although radio@@ metric as@@ says require the removal and counting of samples ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , they are dis@@ continuous as@@ says ) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of en@@ z@@ y@@ me activity .
the en@@ z@@ y@@ me produces product at an initial rate that is approximately lin@@ e@@ ar for a short period after the start of the reaction .
if the initial rate of the reaction is meas@@ ured over a range of sub@@ str@@ ate concentr@@ ations ( den@@ oted as the reaction rate ( " V " ) increases as [ S increases , as shown on the right .
being able to predict how much ox@@ alo@@ ac@@ et@@ ate goes into which path@@ way requires knowledge of the concentration of ox@@ alo@@ ac@@ et@@ ate as well as the concentration and k@@ ine@@ tics of each of these en@@ z@@ y@@ mes .
this aim of predic@@ ting the behaviour of Met@@ abol@@ ic path@@ ways reaches its most complex expression in the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of huge amounts of kin@@ etic and gen@@ e expression data into ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal models of entire organis@@ ms .
if a set of these meas@@ ure@@ ments is performed at different fixed concentr@@ ations of A , these data can be used to work out what the mechanism of the reaction is .

because blue light is sc@@ at@@ tered more easily than red light , the sun takes on a red@@ dish h@@ ue when it is observed through a th@@ ick atmosphere , as during a sun@@ rise or sun@@ set .
because R@@ ain@@ bo@@ ws are seen on the opposite side of the sky as the sun , R@@ ain@@ bo@@ ws are more prominent the closer the sun is to the hor@@ iz@@ on due to their greater distance apart .

tiny parti@@ c@@ les of water are den@@ sely packed and sun@@ light can@@ not pen@@ et@@ rate far into the cl@@ oud before it is reflected out , giving a cl@@ oud its character@@ istic white col@@ or , especially when viewed from the top .

however , according to Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations , the charges in the conduc@@ tor experience a mag@@ ne@@ tic force in the frame of the mag@@ net and an electric force in the frame of the conduc@@ tor .
likewise , the sol@@ en@@ o@@ id@@ al portion of electric fields ( the portion that is not origin@@ ated by electric charges ) becomes a mag@@ ne@@ tic field in another frame : that is , the sol@@ en@@ o@@ id@@ al electric fields and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields are aspects of the same thing .
an alternative unification of descri@@ p@@ tions is to think of the physical entity as the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field ten@@ sor , as described later on .
a strong requirement in physi@@ cs is that all observers of the motion of a parti@@ cle agree on the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the parti@@ cle .
perhaps the simp@@ lest example , and one that E@@ in@@ stein referen@@ ced in his 19@@ 05 paper introducing special rela@@ tivity , is the problem of a conduc@@ tor moving in the field of a mag@@ net .
the mag@@ ne@@ tic field in the mag@@ net frame and the electric field in the conduc@@ tor frame must generate consistent results in the conduc@@ tor .
as a by@@ product , this argument will " also " yield a general formula for the electric and mag@@ ne@@ tic fields in one frame in terms of the fields in another frame .
= = = mag@@ net frame = = = In the rest frame of the mag@@ net , the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is some fixed field B ( R ) , determined by the structure and shape of the mag@@ net .
( the A@@ mp@@ ere @@@ -@@ @ Max@@ well equ@@ ation also comes into play , explaining how , in the conduc@@ tor 's frame , this moving electric field will contribute to the mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
assuming a Lor@@ ent@@ z transformation , inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ance of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations then leads to the above transformation of the fields for this example .
so the force on the charge is not the same in both fra@@ mes , but it trans@@ forms as expected according to rela@@ tivity .

* Spe@@ ed : this is the speed at which a point on the wave ( for example , a point of maximum stretch or squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e ) travels .
the polar@@ ization of a wave depends on the an@@ gle from the source , as we will see in the next section .
when the radi@@ us has sh@@ run@@ k to half its initial value , it is sh@@ rin@@ king eight times faster than before .

the Egyp@@ t@@ ologist James P@@ . Al@@ len estimates that more than 1,@@ 400 de@@ ities are named in Egyptian tex@@ ts , whereas his colleague Christian Le@@ itz says there are " thousands upon thousands " of go@@ ds .

as temp@@ les were the fo@@ cal points of Egyptian cities , the go@@ d in a city 's main temp@@ le was the pat@@ ron go@@ d for the city and the surrounding region .
H@@ ath@@ or , as a fer@@ tility go@@ d@@ de@@ ss , could act as mother to any child go@@ d , including the child form of the sun go@@ d , although in other circumstances she was the sun go@@ d 's daughter .

in this no@@ tion , a fixed initial state of a mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic system correspon@@ ds to relatively low ent@@ rop@@ y because the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les of the body are con@@ strained .
one can , however equally well imag@@ ine a state of the uni@@ verse in which the mo@@ tions of all of the parti@@ c@@ les at one in@@ stan@@ t were the rever@@ se ( strictly , the C@@ P@@ T rever@@ se ) .
one position is to say that the constant increase of ent@@ rop@@ y we observe happens " only " because of the initial state of our uni@@ verse .
other possible states of the uni@@ verse ( for example , a uni@@ verse at heat death equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ) would actually result in no increase of ent@@ rop@@ y .
in this view , the apparent T @@@ -@@ @ asy@@ m@@ me@@ try of our uni@@ verse is a problem in cos@@ m@@ ology : why did the uni@@ verse start with a low ent@@ rop@@ y ?
the modern view of black hol@@ e ir@@ re@@ versi@@ bility is to rela@@ te it to the second law of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics , since black ho@@ les are viewed as ther@@ mo@@ dynamic objects .

physical processes at the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic level are believed to be either entirely or mostly time @@@ -@@ @ sym@@ metric : if the direction of time were to rever@@ se , the the@@ ore@@ tical statements that describe them would remain true .
yet at the mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic level it often appears that this is not the case : there is an obvious direction ( or " flow " ) of time .
the ther@@ mo@@ dynamic ar@@ row of time is provided by the Second Law of T@@ her@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics , which says that in an isolated system , ent@@ rop@@ y ten@@ ds to increase with time .
Alternati@@ vely , it may be an arti@@ fact of our place in the uni@@ verse 's evol@@ ution ( see the An@@ thro@@ p@@ ic bias ) , with this ar@@ row re@@ vers@@ ing as gra@@ vity pul@@ ls everything back into a Big cr@@ un@@ ch .
if this ar@@ row of time is related to the other ar@@ ro@@ ws of time , then the future is " by defin@@ ition " the direction towards which the uni@@ verse becomes bigger .
an ep@@ istem@@ ological problem with using ca@@ us@@ ality as an ar@@ row of time is that , as David Hum@@ e maintained , the ca@@ usal relation per se can@@ not be perceived ; one only perce@@ ives sequ@@ ences of events .
however , it does seem evident that dropping a c@@ up of water is a cause while the c@@ up subsequently sh@@ at@@ tering and sp@@ illing the water is the effect .

to add another elec@@ tr@@ on to a given volume requires raising an elec@@ tr@@ on 's energy level to make room , and this requirement for energy to com@@ press the material manif@@ ests as a pressure .
when the pressure due to this " He@@ is@@ en@@ berg motion " exceeds that of the pressure from the thermal mo@@ tions of the elec@@ tr@@ ons , the elec@@ tr@@ ons are referred to as de@@ generate , and the material is termed de@@ generate matter .

the effective temper@@ ature of a star indicates the amount of heat that the star radi@@ ates per unit of sur@@ face area .
an al@@ bed@@ o of 1 means that all the radi@@ ation is reflected , an al@@ bed@@ o of 0 means all of it is absor@@ bed .
the area of the plan@@ et that absor@@ bs the power from the star is A@@ ab@@ s which is some frac@@ tion of the total sur@@ face area formula _ 8 , where R is the radi@@ us of the plan@@ et .
an al@@ bed@@ o of 1 means that all the radi@@ ation is reflected , an al@@ bed@@ o of 0 means all of it is absor@@ bed .
one reason for the difference between the two values is due to the green@@ house effect , which increases the average temper@@ ature of the Earth 's sur@@ face .

an observer in a win@@ dow@@ less room can@@ not distingu@@ ish between being on the sur@@ face of the Earth , and being in a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hip in deep space acceler@@ ating at 1@@ g .
if an observer measures a pat@@ ch of space to be flat , then the strong equi@@ val@@ ence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other pat@@ ch of flat space elsewhere in the uni@@ verse .
" ] : and from J@@ . D@@ . N@@ ort@@ on : the discussion is taken beyond simple space @@@ -@@ @ time co@@ ordinate systems by Br@@ ading and Cas@@ tel@@ lani .
here we adopt the view expressed by Kum@@ ar and Bar@@ ve : an ob@@ serv@@ ational frame of reference is character@@ ized " only by its state of motion . "
in special rela@@ tivity , the distinc@@ tion is sometimes made between an " observer " and a " frame . "
this restricted view is not used here , and is not uni@@ vers@@ ally adopted even in discussions of rela@@ tivity .
in general rela@@ tivity the use of general co@@ ordinate systems is common ( see , for example , the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild solution for the gra@@ vit@@ ational field outside an isolated sp@@ here ) .
in physi@@ cs experim@@ ents , the frame of reference in which the laboratory meas@@ urement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the laboratory frame or simply " lab frame .
in order to catch up to the first car , it will take a time of , that is , 25 seconds , as before .
in his frame of reference , Alfred defin@@ es the spot where he is standing as the origin , the road as the x @@@ -@@ @ ax@@ is and the direction in front of him as the positive y @@@ -@@ @ ax@@ is .
to him , the car moves along the " x " ax@@ is with some v@@ el@@ o@@ city " V " in the positive x @@@ -@@ @ direction .
if she is driving north , then north is the positive " y " -@@ direction ; if she turns east , east becomes the positive " y " -@@ direction .
fra@@ mes of reference are especially important in special rela@@ tivity , because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant frac@@ tion of the speed of light , then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame .
New@@ ton says that the rate of time as meas@@ ured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another .
that is , there exists a " universal " time and all other times in all other fra@@ mes of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time ir@@ respective of their position and v@@ el@@ o@@ city .
in a similar way , it is now common to describe that we exist in a four @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional geo@@ me@@ try known as sp@@ ac@@ etime .
an accelerated frame of reference is often de@@ lin@@ e@@ ated as being the " pri@@ med " frame , and all vari@@ ables that are dependent on that frame are no@@ ta@@ ted with pri@@ mes , e@@ .@@ g@@ .

a common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and transla@@ ting ( an example is a frame of reference att@@ ached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried ) .

in particular they resulted in the identification of the symp@@ t@@ oms of the pending changes in the life of a star .

it has been proposed that they em@@ it black @@@ -@@ @ body radi@@ ation ( called Haw@@ king radi@@ ation ) , with a temper@@ ature that depends on the mass of the black hol@@ e .
the spectrum is pe@@ aked at a character@@ istic frequ@@ ency that shi@@ fts to higher frequ@@ encies with increasing temper@@ ature , and at room temper@@ ature most of the emis@@ sion is in the inf@@ rar@@ ed region of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic spectrum .
because of its high temper@@ ature , the S@@ un em@@ its to a large extent in the ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let and visible ( U@@ V @@@ -@@ @ V@@ is ) frequ@@ ency range .
in this frequ@@ ency range , the plan@@ et reflects a frac@@ tion formula _ 31 of this energy where formula _ 31 is the al@@ bed@@ o or reflec@@ tance of the plan@@ et in the U@@ V @@@ -@@ @ V@@ is range .
this temper@@ ature , calculated for the case of the plan@@ et acting as a black body by setting formula _ 38 , is known as the effective temper@@ ature .
ignoring the atmosphere and green@@ house effect , the plan@@ et , since it is at a much lower temper@@ ature than the S@@ un , em@@ its mostly in the inf@@ rar@@ ed ( I@@ R ) portion of the spectrum .
in this frequ@@ ency range , it em@@ its formula _ 39 of the radi@@ ation that a black body would em@@ it where formula _ 39 is the average emis@@ si@@ vity in the I@@ R range .
prior to this time , most matter in the uni@@ verse was in the form of an ion@@ ized plas@@ ma in thermal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um with radi@@ ation .

after a period of research starting from 19@@ 75 , the first commercial fi@@ ber @@@ -@@ @ op@@ tic communications system was developed , which operated at a w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th around 0.@@ 8 µ@@ m and used G@@ a@@ As sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor las@@ ers .
they were used at that time for the transmission of television channels , not available because of local rec@@ eption problems .
by 1987 , these systems were operating at bit rates of up to 1.7 G@@ b / s with repe@@ ater sp@@ ac@@ ing up to 50 km .
third @@@ -@@ @ generation fi@@ ber @@@ -@@ @ op@@ tic systems operated at 1.@@ 55 µ@@ m and had losses of about 0.2 d@@ B / km .
however , due to their relatively simple design , L@@ E@@ Ds are very useful for low @@@ -@@ @ cost applications .
a sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor las@@ er em@@ its light through stimu@@ lated emis@@ sion rather than spon@@ tane@@ ous emis@@ sion , which results in high output power ( ~ 100 m@@ W ) as well as other benefits related to the nature of co@@ her@@ ent light .
com@@ mon@@ ly used classes of sem@@ ic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor las@@ er trans@@ mit@@ ters used in fi@@ ber op@@ tics include V@@ C@@ SE@@ L ( ver@@ tical @@@ -@@ @ c@@ av@@ ity Sur@@ face @@@ -@@ @ E@@ mitting L@@ as@@ er ) , F@@ ab@@ ry @@@ -@@ @ P@@ é@@ ro@@ t and D@@ F@@ B ( distributed fe@@ ed B@@ ack ) .
L@@ as@@ er di@@ o@@ des are often directly mo@@ du@@ lated , that is the light output is controlled by a current applied directly to the device .
however , a multi @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ de fi@@ ber introdu@@ ces multi@@ mo@@ de dist@@ or@@ tion , which often limits the b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th and length of the link .
because of the high complex@@ ity with modern w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th @@@ -@@ @ division multi@@ p@@ lex@@ ed signals ( including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km ) , the cost of these repe@@ at@@ ers is very high .
an alternative approach is to use an op@@ tical amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er , which amp@@ li@@ fies the op@@ tical signal directly without having to conver@@ t the signal into the electrical dom@@ ain .
this value is a product of b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th and distance because there is a trade off between the b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th of the signal and the distance it can be carried .
disper@@ sion limits the b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th of the fi@@ ber because the spreading op@@ tical pul@@ se limits the rate that pul@@ ses can follow one another on the fi@@ ber and still be distingu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble at the recei@@ ver .
the Comp@@ ton w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of a parti@@ cle is equivalent to the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of a pho@@ ton whose energy is the same as the rest @@@ -@@ @ mass energy of the parti@@ cle .

the Comp@@ ton w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th can be contr@@ asted with the de Bro@@ g@@ lie w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , which depends on the momentum of a parti@@ cle and determin@@ es the cut@@ off between parti@@ cle and wave behavi@@ or in qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
this special distance is called the Plan@@ ck length ( formula _ 20 ) .
this means the parti@@ cle sp@@ ends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well , as we would expect for a state with little energy .

in fact , the quanti@@ ty called " vol@@ t@@ age " as meas@@ ured in an electronic cir@@ cu@@ it has a simple relationship to the chemical potential for elec@@ tr@@ ons ( Fer@@ mi level ) .
if there is a state at the Fer@@ mi level ( " ϵ " = " µ " ) , then this state will have a 50 % chance of being occupied at any given time .
for this reason it is common to focus on the value of " ζ " when concentr@@ ating on the properties of elec@@ tr@@ ons in a single , h@@ omo@@ gen@@ e@@ ous conduc@@ tive material .
when the device is brought out of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and put into use , then strictly speaking the Fer@@ mi level and temper@@ ature are no longer well defined .
it also has the advantage of being acces@@ sible , so that the Fer@@ mi level of any other object can be meas@@ ured simply with a vol@@ t@@ meter .
the source of this vac@@ u@@ um potential vari@@ ation is the vari@@ ation in work function between the different conducting materials ex@@ posed to vac@@ u@@ um .
as the force due to the inter@@ action of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance , the effect of the closer ( opposite polar@@ ity ) charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction .
this process is integral to the work@@ ings of the Van de Gra@@ aff gener@@ ator , a device com@@ mon@@ ly used to demonstrate the effects of st@@ atic electricity .
the energy stored as st@@ atic electricity on an object var@@ ies depending on the size of the object and its capac@@ it@@ ance , the vol@@ t@@ age to which it is charged , and the di@@ electric constant of the surrounding medium .
while the total energy is small , on the order of milli@@ j@@ ou@@ les , it can still damage sensitive electronic devices .
in the pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry , 50 p@@ S / m is the recommended minimum value of electrical Con@@ duc@@ tivity for adequate removal of charge from a f@@ lu@@ id .
as little as 0.2 milli@@ j@@ ou@@ les may present an ign@@ ition haz@@ ard ; such low spark energy is often below the threshold of human vis@@ ual and audi@@ tory perception .
since the w@@ ire lo@@ op may be moving , we write Σ ( " t " ) for the sur@@ face .
in more vis@@ ual terms , the mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ x through the w@@ ire lo@@ op is propor@@ tional to the number of mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ x lines that pass through the lo@@ op .

for stars that lie near the plane of the Mil@@ ky Way and are within a few thousand par@@ sec@@ s of the Earth , ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion in the V band is on the order of 1.8 mag@@ n@@ itu@@ des per kil@@ op@@ ar@@ se@@ c .
in the solar neigh@@ bor@@ hood , the rate of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion in the Johnson @@@ -@@ @ co@@ usin@@ s V @@@ -@@ @ band is usually taken to be 0.@@ 7 @@@ -@@ @ 1.@@ 0 ma@@ g / KPC − simply an average due to the " cl@@ ump@@ iness " of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar d@@ ust .
in general , however , this means that a star will have its bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V @@@ -@@ @ band for every kil@@ op@@ ar@@ se@@ c it is further away from us .
for our own Gal@@ ax@@ y , the Mil@@ ky Way , the typical value for R ( V ) is 3.@@ 1 , but is found to be between 2.5 and 6 for different lines of sight .
it is also possible to use a the@@ ore@@ tical spectrum instead of the observed spectrum for the comparison , but this is less common .
a rati@@ o other than 2.@@ 85 must therefore be due to ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion , and the amount of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion can thus be calculated .

since the 197@@ 0s , the most widely accepted model has been that the lob@@ es or p@@ lu@@ mes are pow@@ ered by " be@@ ams " of high @@@ -@@ @ energy parti@@ c@@ les and mag@@ ne@@ tic field coming from close to the active n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
F@@ R@@ I@@ Is appear to be able to transport energy efficiently to the ends of the lob@@ es , while F@@ RI be@@ ams are inefficient in the sense that they radi@@ ate a significant amount of their energy away as they travel .
in more detail , the F@@ RI / F@@ R@@ II division depends on host @@@ -@@ @ Gal@@ ax@@ y environment in the sense that the F@@ RI / F@@ R@@ II transition appears at higher l@@ umin@@ os@@ ities in more massive gal@@ ax@@ ies .
in the case of sources with lob@@ es , the dynam@@ ics are fairly simple : the j@@ ets fe@@ ed the lob@@ es , the pressure of the lob@@ es increases , and the lob@@ es expand .

active Gal@@ ac@@ tic N@@ uc@@ le@@ i are the most l@@ umin@@ ous sources of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation in the Uni@@ verse , and their evol@@ ution puts constra@@ ints on cos@@ m@@ ological models .

= = = Ed@@ d@@ ington l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity = = = A lower limit to the mass of the central black hol@@ e can be calculated using the Ed@@ d@@ ington l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity .
the exact geo@@ me@@ try of the em@@ it@@ ting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the Gal@@ ac@@ tic cen@@ ter .
for 35 AG@@ N , rever@@ ber@@ ation m@@ apping has been used to calc@@ ulate the mass of the central black ho@@ les and the size of the broad line regions .
the spec@@ tra of some of these gal@@ ax@@ ies have changed from T@@ y@@ pe 1.5 to T@@ y@@ pe II in a matter of a few years .
by contrast , in T@@ y@@ pe II Sey@@ fer@@ t gal@@ ax@@ ies , the active N@@ uc@@ le@@ i are ob@@ sc@@ ured and only the col@@ der ou@@ ter regions located further away from the cl@@ ou@@ ds ' broad line emis@@ sion region are seen .
the broad lines origin@@ ate above the acc@@ re@@ tion dis@@ c of the super@@ massive black hol@@ e thought to power the Gal@@ ax@@ y , while the narrow lines occur beyond the broad line region of the acc@@ re@@ tion dis@@ c .
when the Gal@@ ax@@ y is viewed from the side , the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us is indirectly observed through ref@@ le@@ ction by gas and d@@ ust above and below the tor@@ us .
in T@@ y@@ pe 1.8 , very weak broad lines can be detec@@ ted in the H@@ β lines as well as H@@ α , even if they are very weak compared to the H@@ α .
very similar to Sey@@ fer@@ ts are the low @@@ -@@ @ ion@@ isation narrow @@@ -@@ @ line emis@@ sion radio gal@@ ax@@ ies ( lin@@ er ) , discovered in 1980 .
some ob@@ serv@@ ations suggest that AG@@ N emis@@ sion from the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us is not sp@@ her@@ ically sym@@ metric and that the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us often shows ax@@ ial sym@@ me@@ try , with radi@@ ation escap@@ ing in a con@@ ical region .
based on this ob@@ serv@@ ations , models have been dev@@ ised to explain the different classes of AG@@ N@@ s as due to their different ori@@ ent@@ ations with respect to the ob@@ serv@@ ational line of sight .
unified models explain the difference between Sey@@ fer@@ t I and Sey@@ fer@@ t II gal@@ ax@@ ies as being the result of Sey@@ fer@@ t II gal@@ ax@@ ies being surrounded by ob@@ s@@ cur@@ ing tor@@ uses which prevent us from seeing the broad line region .

they also cause many chemical and physical changes in the target by transferring their energy and momentum to the elec@@ tr@@ ons and at@@ om@@ ic N@@ uc@@ le@@ i of the target material .
because the ions have mas@@ ses compar@@ able to those of the target At@@ oms , they kno@@ ck the target At@@ oms out of place more than elec@@ tr@@ on be@@ ams do .
however , there is often great structural damage to the target , and because the dep@@ th distribution is broad ( Bra@@ g@@ g peak ) , the net composition change at any point in the target will be small .

hence , the inten@@ s@@ ity of radi@@ ation passing through any unit area ( directly facing the point source ) is in@@ ver@@ sely propor@@ tional to the square of the distance from the point source .
if the distribution of matter in each body is sp@@ her@@ ically sym@@ metric , then the objects can be treated as point mas@@ ses without approxim@@ ation , as shown in the shel@@ l the@@ o@@ rem .
however , if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their siz@@ es , then to a good approxim@@ ation , it is reasonable to treat the mas@@ ses as point mass while calc@@ ulating the gra@@ vit@@ ational force .

the frac@@ tional reduction in elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ ence ( Φ ) for indirectly ion@@ iz@@ ing radi@@ ation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the in@@ verse @@@ -@@ @ square law .
at large dist@@ ances from the source ( compared to the size of the source ) , this power is distributed over larger and larger sp@@ her@@ ical sur@@ faces as the distance from the source increases .
= = = A@@ co@@ us@@ tics = = = In ac@@ ous@@ tics one usually measures the sound pressure at a given distance " R " from the source using the 1 / R law .
since inten@@ s@@ ity is propor@@ tional to the square of pressure am@@ pl@@ itu@@ de , this is just a vari@@ ation on the in@@ verse @@@ -@@ @ square law .
the sound inten@@ s@@ ity is the product of the R@@ MS sound pressure and the " in @@@ -@@ @ phase " component of the R@@ MS parti@@ cle v@@ el@@ o@@ city , both of which are in@@ verse @@@ -@@ @ propor@@ tional .
for according to 6 & 7 , there is as much light in the narro@@ wer sp@@ her@@ ical sur@@ face , as in the wider , thus it is as much more com@@ pressed and den@@ se here than there .
although the volume of a con@@ e is propor@@ tional to the cu@@ be of its he@@ ight , Ho@@ oke argued that the air 's pressure at the ear@@ th 's sur@@ face is instead propor@@ tional to the he@@ ight of the atmosphere because gra@@ vity dimin@@ is@@ hes with al@@ titu@@ de .

the equ@@ ations of motion describe the movement of the cen@@ ter of mass of a body .
since the object 's v@@ el@@ o@@ city v@@ ec@@ tor is constantly changing direction , the moving object is undergoing acceler@@ ation by a cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force in the direction of the cen@@ ter of ro@@ tation .
= = uni@@ form cir@@ cular motion = = In physi@@ cs , uni@@ form cir@@ cular motion describes the motion of a body tra@@ vers@@ ing a cir@@ cular path at constant speed .
this acceler@@ ation is , in turn , produced by a cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force which is also constant in mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de and directed towards the ax@@ is of ro@@ tation .
although the object has a constant " speed , " its " direction " is always changing .
here is an example with an object traveling in a stra@@ ight path then lo@@ ops a lo@@ op back into a stra@@ ight path again .
the normal force is actually the sum of the radi@@ al and tan@@ gen@@ tial forces that help to counter@@ act the weight force and contribute to the cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force .
the ver@@ tical component of the normal force is what counter@@ acts the weight of the object .
in non @@@ -@@ @ uni@@ form cir@@ cular motion , normal force and weight may point in the same direction .
both forces can point down , yet the object will remain in a cir@@ cular path without falling stra@@ ight down .
in the first di@@ ag@@ ram , let 's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane , the two forces point down only when it reaches the top of the circ@@ le .
from a logical stand@@ point , a person who is traveling in the plane will be U@@ p@@ side down at the top of the circ@@ le .
once an object is thrown into the air , there is only the down@@ ward force of ear@@ th 's gra@@ vity that acts on the object .
that does not mean that once an object is thrown in the air , it will fall in@@ stan@@ tly .
although there are additional forces acting upon the object , the sum of all the forces acting on the object will have to equal to the cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force .
since the sum of all forces is the cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force , drawing cent@@ ri@@ pet@@ al force into a free body di@@ ag@@ ram is not necessary and usually not recommended .
for example , the vis@@ ual above showing an object at the top of a sem@@ ic@@ irc@@ le would be expressed as formula _ 69 .
in uni@@ form cir@@ cular motion , total acceler@@ ation of an object in a cir@@ cular path is equal to the radi@@ al acceler@@ ation .

another line of research has been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi @@@ -@@ @ jun@@ ction approach , although these cells are very high cost and su@@ itable only for large commercial deplo@@ y@@ ments .
as in a conventional alk@@ al@@ ine bat@@ tery , an ano@@ de ( the ti@@ tan@@ ium di@@ ox@@ ide ) and a c@@ ath@@ o@@ de ( the pla@@ tin@@ um ) are placed on either side of a liqu@@ id conduc@@ tor ( the elec@@ tr@@ ol@@ y@@ te ) .
after flow@@ ing through the external cir@@ cu@@ it , they are re @@@ -@@ @ introduced into the cell on a metal elec@@ tro@@ de on the back , flow@@ ing into the elec@@ tr@@ ol@@ y@@ te .
finally , in order to understand the under@@ lying physi@@ cs , the " qu@@ ant@@ um efficiency " is used to compar@@ e the chance that one pho@@ ton ( of a particular energy ) will create one elec@@ tr@@ on .
the qu@@ ant@@ um efficiency of traditional design@@ s v@@ ary , depending on their th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness , but are about the same as the DS@@ SC .
these factors limit the current generated by a DS@@ SC , for comparison , a traditional sil@@ ic@@ on @@@ -@@ @ based solar cell offers about 35 MA / c@@ m@@ 2 , whereas current DS@@ SC@@ s offer about 20 MA / c@@ m@@ 2 .

a would @@@ -@@ @ be theory that makes no ob@@ serv@@ able predic@@ tions is not a scientific theory at all .
the strength of the evidence is evalu@@ ated by the scientific community , and the most important experim@@ ents will have been rep@@ lic@@ ated by multiple independent groups .
like all knowledge in science , no theory can ever be completely certain , since it is possible that future experim@@ ents might conflict with the theory 's predic@@ tions .
after the changes , the accepted theory will explain more phenom@@ ena and have greater predic@@ tive power ( if it did not , the changes would not be adopted ) ; this new explanation will then be open to further replacement or modi@@ fication .
this also means that accepted the@@ ories continue to acc@@ um@@ ulate evidence over time , and the length of time that a theory ( or any of its principles ) remains accepted often indicates the strength of its supporting evidence .
for example , physical the@@ ories in the 19th century imp@@ lied that the S@@ un could not have been burning long enough to allow certain ge@@ ological changes as well as the evol@@ ution of life .
the phenom@@ ena explained by the the@@ ories , if they could not be directly observed by the sen@@ ses ( for example , At@@ oms and radio waves ) , were treated as the@@ ore@@ tical concep@@ ts .
one can use language to describe a model ; however , the theory is the model ( or a collection of similar models ) , and not the descri@@ ption of the model .
a model of the solar system , for example , might cons@@ ist of ab@@ str@@ act objects that represent the sun and the plan@@ ets .
in this model , the Earth was at the cen@@ ter , the plan@@ ets and the sun made cir@@ cular or@@ bi@@ ts around the ear@@ th , and the stars were fixed on a sp@@ here cen@@ tered on Earth but beyond the plan@@ etary or@@ bi@@ ts .
while ass@@ ump@@ tions are often incorpor@@ ated during the formation of new the@@ ories , these are either supported by evidence ( such as from previously existing the@@ ories ) or the evidence is produced in the course of val@@ id@@ ating the theory .
such ass@@ ump@@ tions are often the point with which older the@@ ories are succeeded by new ones ( the general theory of rela@@ tivity works in non @@@ -@@ @ iner@@ tial reference fra@@ mes as well ) .

when the temper@@ ature of the body is greater than absolute zero , inter@@ at@@ om@@ ic col@@ lis@@ ions cause the kin@@ etic energy of the At@@ oms or mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les to change .

it was proposed by John Bar@@ de@@ en , Le@@ on Cooper , and John Robert Sch@@ ri@@ effer ( " B@@ C@@ S " ) in 19@@ 57 ; they received the Nobel Prize in P@@ hy@@ sics for this theory in 197@@ 2 .
John Bar@@ de@@ en then argued in the 19@@ 55 paper , " The@@ ory of the Me@@ is@@ s@@ ner E@@ ff@@ ect in super@@ conduc@@ tors , " that such a modi@@ fication n@@ atur@@ ally occur@@ s in a theory with an energy gap .
these effects are still not yet fully understood ; it is possible that they even control super@@ conduc@@ tivity at low temperatures for some materials .
the B@@ C@@ S theory , however , requires only that the potential be attractive , regardless of its origin .
in this " con@@ den@@ sed " state , the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire con@@ den@@ s@@ ate - not just a single elec@@ tr@@ on , or a single pair .
in the normal state of a metal , elec@@ tr@@ ons move independently , whereas in the B@@ C@@ S state , they are bound into Cooper p@@ airs by the attractive inter@@ action .
this helped to support the idea of bound parti@@ c@@ les - specifically elec@@ tr@@ on p@@ airs - and together with the above helped to pain@@ t a general picture of p@@ aired elec@@ tr@@ ons and their lat@@ tice inter@@ actions .
B@@ C@@ S theory rela@@ tes the value of the critical field at zero temper@@ ature to the value of the transition temper@@ ature and the den@@ s@@ ity of states at the Fer@@ mi level .
a Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild black hol@@ e or st@@ atic black hol@@ e is a black hol@@ e that has no charge or an@@ gular momentum .
a Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild black hol@@ e is described by the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric , and can@@ not be distinguished from any other Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild black hol@@ e except by its mass .
the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild black hol@@ e is character@@ ized by a surrounding sp@@ her@@ ical sur@@ face , called the event hor@@ iz@@ on , which is situated at the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild radi@@ us , often called the radi@@ us of a black hol@@ e .
for example , the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild radi@@ us " R " " s " of the Earth is roughly , while the S@@ un , which is 3.3 × 1@@ 05 times as massive has a Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild radi@@ us of approximately .
in Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild 's original paper , he put what we now call the event hor@@ iz@@ on at the origin of his co@@ ordinate system .
in this paper he also introduced what is now known as the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild radi@@ al co@@ ordinate ( " R " in the equ@@ ations above ) , as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary vari@@ able .
in his equ@@ ations , Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild was using a different radi@@ al co@@ ordinate that was zero at the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild radi@@ us .
in 19@@ 50 , John Syn@@ ge produced a paper that showed the maxim@@ al analy@@ tic extension of the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric , again showing that the sing@@ ular@@ ity at " R " = " R " s was a co@@ ordinate arti@@ fact and that it represented two hor@@ iz@@ ons .
if one asks that the solution be valid for all " R " one runs into a true physical sing@@ ular@@ ity , or " gra@@ vit@@ ational sing@@ ular@@ ity , " at the origin .
to see that this is a true sing@@ ular@@ ity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of co@@ ordin@@ ates .

the Ker@@ r @@@ -@@ @ New@@ man solution ( with cos@@ m@@ ological constant equal to zero ) is also a special case of more general exact solutions of the E@@ in@@ stein @@@ -@@ @ Max@@ well E@@ qu@@ ations .

although it represents a general@@ ization of the Ker@@ r metric , it is not considered as very important for astro@@ physical purposes since one does not expect that realistic black ho@@ les have an important electric charge .

p@@ ure qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ical concep@@ ts are central to the phenomenon , so qu@@ ant@@ um tun@@ nel@@ ling is one of the novel implications of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
= = History = = qu@@ ant@@ um tun@@ nel@@ ling was developed from the study of radio@@ activity , which was discovered in 18@@ 96 by Hen@@ ri Bec@@ qu@@ er@@ el .
Fri@@ ed@@ rich H@@ und was the first to take no@@ tice of tun@@ nel@@ ling in 19@@ 27 when he was calc@@ ulating the ground state of the double @@@ -@@ @ well potential .
its first application was a ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal explanation for Alpha dec@@ ay , which was done in 19@@ 28 by George G@@ am@@ ow and independently by Ron@@ ald Gur@@ ney and Edward Con@@ don .
in qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , these parti@@ c@@ les can , with a very small prob@@ ability , " tunnel " to the other side , thus crossing the barrier .
the reason for this difference comes from the treatment of matter in qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics as having properties of waves and parti@@ c@@ les .
using ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal formu@@ lations of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics , such as the Sch@@ rö@@ d@@ inger equ@@ ation , the wave function can be solved .
for both cases , medium A is a region of space where the parti@@ cle 's total energy is greater than its potential energy and medium B is the potential barrier .
Alternati@@ vely , if M ( x ) is constant and positive , then the Sch@@ rö@@ d@@ inger equ@@ ation can be written in the form : formula _ 5@@ The solutions of this equ@@ ation are rising and falling ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ als in the form of ev@@ an@@ es@@ cent waves .
sub@@ stitut@@ ing the second equ@@ ation into the first and using the fact that the imag@@ inary part needs to be 0 results in : : formula _ 10 .
away from the potential hill , the parti@@ cle acts similar to a free and os@@ cil@@ la@@ ting wave ; ben@@ e@@ ath the potential hill , the parti@@ cle under@@ goes ex@@ pon@@ ential changes in am@@ pl@@ itu@@ de .
given the 2 co@@ effici@@ ents on one side of a classical turning point , the 2 co@@ effici@@ ents on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them .
the relationships between formula _ 32 and formula _ 33 are : formula _ 3@@ 4@@ and : formula _ 3@@ 5@@ With the co@@ effici@@ ents found , the global solution can be found .
in ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal physi@@ cs , equ@@ ations of motion are equ@@ ations that describe the behaviour of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time .
if the dynam@@ ics of a system is known , the equ@@ ations are the solutions to the differ@@ ential equ@@ ations describing the motion of the dynam@@ ics .
in this instance , sometimes the term ref@@ ers to the differ@@ ential equ@@ ations that the system satis@@ fies ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , New@@ ton 's second law or Eu@@ ler @@@ -@@ @ Lag@@ range equ@@ ations ) , and sometimes to the solutions to those equ@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary to use " θ , " but this does not have to be the po@@ lar an@@ gle used in po@@ lar co@@ ordinate systems .

the Ker@@ r metric is an exact solution of the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations of general rela@@ tivity ; these equ@@ ations are highly non @@@ -@@ @ lin@@ e@@ ar , which makes exact solutions very difficult to find .
the Ker@@ r metric is a general@@ ization of the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric , which was discovered by Kar@@ l Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild in 19@@ 16 and which describes the geo@@ me@@ try of sp@@ ac@@ etime around an un@@ charged , sp@@ her@@ ically @@@ -@@ @ sym@@ metric , and non @@@ -@@ @ rotating body .
however , the exact solution for an un@@ charged , " rotating " black @@@ -@@ @ hol@@ e , the Ker@@ r metric , remained un@@ solved until 1963 , when it was discovered by Ro@@ y Ker@@ r .
rotating black ho@@ les have sur@@ faces where the metric appears to have a sing@@ ular@@ ity ; the size and shape of these sur@@ faces depends on the black hol@@ e 's mass and an@@ gular momentum .
< / math > _ } } Th@@ us , an iner@@ tial reference frame is ent@@ ra@@ ined by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter 's ro@@ tation ; this is called frame @@@ -@@ @ dra@@ gging , and has been tested experim@@ ent@@ ally .
if she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms , iner@@ tial effects and frame @@@ -@@ @ dra@@ gging effects will balance and her sp@@ in will not change .
a useful met@@ ap@@ h@@ or is a plan@@ etary ge@@ ar system with the black hol@@ e being the sun ge@@ ar , the ice sk@@ ater being a plan@@ etary ge@@ ar and the outside uni@@ verse being the ring ge@@ ar .
however , this is impossible within the erg@@ os@@ phere , where " g@@ t@@ t " is negative , unless the parti@@ cle is co @@@ -@@ @ rotating with the interior mass " M " with an an@@ gular speed at least of Ω .
as with the event hor@@ iz@@ on in the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric the apparent sing@@ ular@@ ities at rin@@ ner and ro@@ u@@ ter are an illu@@ sion created by the choice of co@@ ordin@@ ates ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , they are co@@ ordinate sing@@ ular@@ ities ) .
it is forced to fall in@@ wards , and so this is sometimes called the " st@@ atic limit . "
the net process is that the rotating black hol@@ e em@@ its ener@@ ge@@ tic parti@@ c@@ les at the cost of its own total energy .
the possibility of extr@@ acting sp@@ in energy from a rotating black hol@@ e was first proposed by the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cian Ro@@ ger Pen@@ rose in 19@@ 69 and is thus called the Pen@@ rose process .
rotating black ho@@ les in astro@@ physi@@ cs are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain ener@@ ge@@ tic phenom@@ ena , such as gam@@ ma ray bur@@ sts .
the W@@ ey@@ l ten@@ sor is al@@ ge@@ bra@@ ically special , in fact it has Petrov type D@@ . The global structure is known .
the larger of these roots determin@@ es the location of the event hor@@ iz@@ on , and the smaller determin@@ es the location of a C@@ au@@ ch@@ y hor@@ iz@@ on .
a ( future @@@ -@@ @ directed , time @@@ -@@ @ like ) cur@@ ve can start in the ex@@ ter@@ ior and pass through the event hor@@ iz@@ on .
the cur@@ ve could then escape to in@@ fin@@ ity in the new region or enter the future event hor@@ iz@@ on of the new ex@@ ter@@ ior region and repeat the process .
on the other hand , in the Ker@@ r solution , the sing@@ ular@@ ity is a ring , and the cur@@ ve may pass through the cen@@ ter of this ring .
since the traj@@ ec@@ tory of observers and parti@@ c@@ les in general rela@@ tivity are described by time @@@ -@@ @ like cur@@ ves , it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past .
the special case formula _ 14 of the Ker@@ r metric yi@@ elds the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric , which models a " non@@ rotating " black hol@@ e which is st@@ atic and sp@@ her@@ ically sym@@ metric , in the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild co@@ ordin@@ ates .
there are alternative formu@@ lations of rela@@ tivis@@ tic multi@@ pol@@ e mom@@ ents due to H@@ ans@@ en , Th@@ or@@ ne , and Ger@@ o@@ ch , which turn out to agree with each other .
these are multi @@@ -@@ @ inde@@ xed quantities whose su@@ it@@ ably sym@@ metri@@ z@@ ed ( anti @@@ -@@ @ sym@@ metri@@ z@@ ed ) parts can be related to the real and imag@@ inary parts of the rela@@ tivis@@ tic mom@@ ents for the full non@@ lin@@ e@@ ar theory in a rather complicated manner .
this works out very nic@@ ely for the non @@@ -@@ @ rotating case , where we can match the Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild vac@@ u@@ um ex@@ ter@@ ior to a Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild f@@ lu@@ id interior , and indeed to more general st@@ atic sp@@ her@@ ically sym@@ metric perfect f@@ lu@@ id solutions .
however , the problem of finding a rotating perfect @@@ -@@ @ f@@ lu@@ id interior which can be mat@@ ched to a Ker@@ r ex@@ ter@@ ior , or indeed to any as@@ ymp@@ to@@ tically flat vac@@ u@@ um ex@@ ter@@ ior solution , has proven very difficult .
in particular , the Wah@@ l@@ qu@@ ist f@@ lu@@ id , which was once thought to be a candidate for mat@@ ching to a Ker@@ r ex@@ ter@@ ior , is now known not to admit any such mat@@ ching .

it was then that hydro@@ gen and hel@@ ium formed to become the content of the first stars , and is responsible for the present hydro@@ gen / hel@@ ium rati@@ o of the cos@@ m@@ os .
some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutr@@ ons ( the R process ) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion .
in addition to the fu@@ sion processes responsible for the growing ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ces of elements in the uni@@ verse , a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new n@@ uc@@ li@@ des on Earth .
this first process , Big Ban@@ g n@@ uc@@ le@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is , was the first type of n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is to occur in the uni@@ verse .
Inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar gas therefore contains declining ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ces of these light elements , which are present only by vir@@ tu@@ e of their n@@ uc@@ le@@ os@@ yn@@ th@@ es@@ is during the Big Ban@@ g .

the closest known real representative of such ex@@ otic matter is the region of p@@ se@@ u@@ do @@@ -@@ @ negative @@@ -@@ @ pressure den@@ s@@ ity produced by the Cas@@ imir effect .
the sol@@ it@@ on phenomenon was first described in 18@@ 34 by John Scot@@ t Rus@@ sell ( 18@@ 08 @@@ -@@ @ 18@@ 82 ) who observed a sol@@ itary wave in the Union Can@@ al in Scot@@ land .
if the pul@@ se has just the right shape , the Ker@@ r effect will exactly can@@ cel the disper@@ sion effect , and the pul@@ se 's shape will not change over time : a sol@@ it@@ on .
the discovery is described here in Scot@@ t Rus@@ sell 's own words : Scot@@ t Rus@@ sell spent some time making practical and the@@ ore@@ tical investigations of these waves .

in some physical con@@ tex@@ ts ( for instance str@@ ing theory ) this feature can be important , which motivated the introduction of a special name for this class of sol@@ it@@ ons .
it is anal@@ og@@ ous to the electric potential with mass playing the role of charge .
the reference location , where the potential is zero , is by convention in@@ fin@@ itely far away from any mass , resulting in a negative potential at any fin@@ ite distance .
in ma@@ them@@ atics the gra@@ vit@@ ational potential is also known as the New@@ ton@@ ian potential and is fundamental in the study of potential theory .
in some situations , the equ@@ ations can be simp@@ lified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position .
for instance , in daily life , in the region close to the sur@@ face of the Earth , the gra@@ vit@@ ational acceler@@ ation can be considered constant .
= = M@@ ulti@@ pol@@ e expansion = = The potential at a point x is given by : formula _ 12@@ The potential can be expanded in a series of Le@@ gen@@ d@@ re pol@@ yn@@ om@@ i@@ als .

because the cl@@ us@@ ter members are of similar age and chemical composition , their properties ( such as distance , age , metal@@ lic@@ ity and ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion ) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars .
because of their location , open clu@@ sters are occasi@@ onally referred to as " Gal@@ ac@@ tic clu@@ sters , " a term that was introduced in 19@@ 25 by the Swiss @@@ -@@ @ American as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer Robert Jul@@ i@@ us Tr@@ ump@@ ler .
Mic@@ ro@@ meter meas@@ ure@@ ments of the positions of stars in clu@@ sters were made as early as 18@@ 77 by the German as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer E@@ . Sch@@ ön@@ feld and further pursu@@ ed by the American as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer E@@ . E@@ . Bar@@ n@@ ard prior to his death in 19@@ 23 .
however , in 19@@ 18 the Dutch @@@ -@@ @ American as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer Adri@@ a@@ an van Ma@@ an@@ en was able to measure the proper motion of stars in part of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter by compar@@ ing photo@@ graphic plates taken at different times .

ste@@ l@@ lar winds and radi@@ ation pressure from the massive stars begins to drive away the hot ion@@ ized gas at a v@@ el@@ o@@ city mat@@ ching the speed of sound in the gas .
after a few million years the cl@@ us@@ ter will experience its first core @@@ -@@ @ collapse super@@ nov@@ a@@ e , which will also exp@@ el gas from the vic@@ in@@ ity .
the largest clu@@ sters can have 1@@ 04 solar mas@@ ses , with the massive cl@@ us@@ ter Wester@@ l@@ und 1 being estimated at 5 × 1@@ 04 solar mas@@ ses ; close to that of a glo@@ bu@@ lar cl@@ us@@ ter .
once they have exha@@ usted their supply of hydro@@ gen through nuclear fu@@ sion , medi@@ um@@ - to low @@@ -@@ @ mass stars shed their ou@@ ter lay@@ ers to form a plan@@ etary ne@@ bul@@ a and evol@@ ve into white d@@ war@@ f@@ s .
in many cases , the stri@@ pping away of the gas from which the cl@@ us@@ ter formed by the radi@@ ation pressure of the hot young stars redu@@ ces the cl@@ us@@ ter mass enough to allow rapid disper@@ sal .
eventually , the cl@@ us@@ ter becomes a stream of stars , not close enough to be a cl@@ us@@ ter but all related and moving in similar direc@@ tions at similar spe@@ eds .
estimated cl@@ us@@ ter half lives , after which half the original cl@@ us@@ ter members will have been lost , range from 150 @@@ -@@ @ 800 million years , depending on the original den@@ s@@ ity .
the study of the ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ces of Li@@ th@@ ium and ber@@ yl@@ li@@ um in open cl@@ us@@ ter stars can give important clu@@ es about the evol@@ ution of stars and their interior structures .
while hydro@@ gen N@@ uc@@ le@@ i can@@ not F@@ use to form hel@@ ium until the temper@@ ature reaches about 10 million K , Li@@ th@@ ium and ber@@ yl@@ li@@ um are destroyed at temperatures of 2.5 million K and 3.5 million K respectively .
this reli@@ es on the fact that the stars of a cl@@ us@@ ter share a common motion through space .

an object 's possible future locations are limited by the speed that the object can move , which is at best the speed of light .
in these situations the object would " have " to move , since its present sp@@ ati@@ al location would not be in its own future light con@@ e .
it is impossible to determine based only on knowledge of the past whether or not something exists in the C@@ TC that can inter@@ fere with other objects in sp@@ ac@@ etime .

the tor@@ us in turn lo@@ ads the mag@@ ne@@ tic field with plas@@ ma , in the process stret@@ ching it into a pan@@ c@@ ake @@@ -@@ @ like structure called a mag@@ net@@ o@@ dis@@ k .
the position of the mag@@ net@@ op@@ ause depends on the pressure ex@@ er@@ ted by the solar wind , which in turn depends on solar activity .
it consists of two lob@@ es ( blue areas in the figure ) , with the mag@@ ne@@ tic field in the southern lo@@ be pointing toward J@@ up@@ iter , and that in the northern lo@@ be pointing away from it .
as cold , den@@ se plas@@ ma moves ou@@ tw@@ ard , it is replaced by hot , low @@@ -@@ @ den@@ s@@ ity plas@@ ma ( temper@@ ature 20 ke@@ V ( 200 million K ) or higher ) moving from the ou@@ ter mag@@ net@@ os@@ phere .
the acceler@@ ation of the plas@@ ma into the co @@@ -@@ @ ro@@ tation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jov@@ ian ro@@ tation to the kin@@ etic energy of the plas@@ ma .
in particular , mag@@ ne@@ tic field lines in the d@@ us@@ k sector are b@@ ent in the opposite direction to those in the da@@ wn sector .
all these ob@@ serv@@ ations indicate that a solar wind driven re@@ connection process , known on Earth as the Dun@@ ge@@ y cycle , may also be taking place in the Jov@@ ian mag@@ net@@ os@@ phere .
as mentioned above , the main ov@@ als are maintained by the strong influx of elec@@ tr@@ ons accelerated by the electric potential dro@@ ps between the mag@@ net@@ o@@ dis@@ k plas@@ ma and the Jov@@ ian ion@@ os@@ phere .
this heating , which produces up to 300 T@@ W of power , is responsible for the strong inf@@ rar@@ ed radi@@ ation from the Jov@@ ian aur@@ or@@ a@@ e and partially for the heating of the ther@@ mos@@ phere of J@@ up@@ iter .
the secondary ov@@ als observed inside the main O@@ val may be related to the bo@@ und@@ ary between open and closed mag@@ ne@@ tic field lines or to the po@@ lar cus@@ ps .
Radio waves with frequ@@ encies of less than about 0.@@ 3 M@@ H@@ z ( and thus w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths longer than 1 km ) are called the Jov@@ ian kilo@@ metric radi@@ ation or K@@ om .
the total em@@ it@@ ted power of the D@@ AM component is about 100 G@@ W , while the power of all other H@@ OM / K@@ om components is about 10 G@@ W .
the energy of the elec@@ tr@@ ons that contribute to the dim emissions is from 0.@@ 1 to 100 Me@@ V , while the leading contribution comes from the elec@@ tr@@ ons with energy in the range 1 @@@ -@@ @ 20 Me@@ V .
the plan@@ etary mag@@ ne@@ tic field strongly influ@@ ences the motion of sub @@@ -@@ @ micro@@ meter ring parti@@ c@@ les as well , which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radi@@ ation .
the inter@@ action of the Jov@@ ian mag@@ net@@ os@@ phere with G@@ any@@ mede , which has an in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic mag@@ ne@@ tic moment , di@@ ffers from its inter@@ action with the non @@@ -@@ @ mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ z@@ ed mo@@ ons .
the first space probe to reach J@@ up@@ iter was p@@ ion@@ e@@ er 10 in December 197@@ 3 , which passed within 2.9 " R " J from the cen@@ ter of the plan@@ et .
in some applications , a Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz co@@ il is used to can@@ cel out the Earth 's mag@@ ne@@ tic field , producing a region with a mag@@ ne@@ tic field inten@@ s@@ ity much closer to zero .
the inf@@ le@@ ction point for a simple co@@ il is located along the co@@ il ax@@ is at a distance formula _ 12 from its centre .
the calc@@ ulation detailed below gives the exact value of the mag@@ ne@@ tic field at the cen@@ ter point .
the E@@ in@@ stein @@@ -@@ @ Hil@@ bert action ( also referred to as Hil@@ bert action ) in general rela@@ tivity is the action that yi@@ elds the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations through the principle of least action .
the Pal@@ at@@ ini formu@@ lation of general rela@@ tivity assu@@ mes the metric and connection to be independent , and var@@ ies with respect to both independently , which makes it possible to include fer@@ m@@ ion@@ ic matter fields with non @@@ -@@ @ integral sp@@ in .
Mag@@ net@@ o@@ hydro@@ dynam@@ ics ( M@@ H@@ D ) ( " mag@@ ne@@ to f@@ lu@@ id dynam@@ ics " or " hydro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tics " ) is the study of the dynam@@ ics of electri@@ cally conducting f@@ lu@@ ids .
the set of equ@@ ations that describe M@@ H@@ D are a combination of the N@@ avier @@@ -@@ @ Sto@@ kes equ@@ ations of f@@ lu@@ id dynam@@ ics and Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism .
this difficulty in re@@ connecting mag@@ ne@@ tic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the f@@ lu@@ id or the source of the mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
mag@@ ne@@ tic re@@ connection in highly conduc@@ tive systems is important because it concent@@ rates energy in time and space , so that g@@ ent@@ le forces applied to a plas@@ ma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bur@@ sts of radi@@ ation .
the liqu@@ id ou@@ ter core moves in the presence of the mag@@ ne@@ tic field and ed@@ dies are set up into the same due to the Cor@@ i@@ ol@@ is effect .
the differ@@ ential solar ro@@ tation may be the long @@@ -@@ @ term effect of mag@@ ne@@ tic dra@@ g at the po@@ les of the S@@ un , an M@@ H@@ D phenomenon due to the Par@@ ker spir@@ al shape assumed by the extended mag@@ ne@@ tic field of the S@@ un .
break@@ down of ideal M@@ H@@ D ( in the form of mag@@ ne@@ tic re@@ connection ) is known to be the cause of solar flar@@ es , the largest explosions in the solar system .

since Ab@@ be numbers are positive , one of the fo@@ cal leng@@ ths must be negative , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , a di@@ ver@@ ging len@@ s , for the condition to be met .
the above are closely related to the specific scene that is captured so no amount of programming and knowledge of the cap@@ turing equipment ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , cam@@ era and len@@ s data ) can overcome these limit@@ ations .
if the op@@ tical fil@@ ter passed only that frequ@@ ency band , then there would be a net transfer of pho@@ t@@ ons , and their energy , from the second system to the first .
in this sense the material of the op@@ a@@ que body is black to radi@@ ation that reaches it , while the whole phenomenon , including the interior and the inter@@ face , does not show perfect black@@ ness .
histor@@ ically , err@@ ors in the nuclear reaction rates have been one of the biggest sources of er@@ ror in ste@@ l@@ lar model@@ ling .
since there are many nuclear species , a compu@@ ter@@ ised reaction network is needed to keep track of how all the ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ces v@@ ary together .
in the core , the l@@ umin@@ os@@ ity due to nuclear reactions is trans@@ mitted to ou@@ ter lay@@ ers princip@@ ally by radi@@ ation .

the si@@ mu@@ lations only cover a very small frac@@ tion of the solar radi@@ us , and are ev@@ id@@ ently far too time @@@ -@@ @ consum@@ ing to be included in general solar mode@@ ling .
an extension of mi@@ xing @@@ -@@ @ length theory , including effects of turbul@@ ent pressure and kin@@ etic energy , based on num@@ er@@ ical si@@ mu@@ lations of near @@@ -@@ @ sur@@ face conv@@ ection , has been developed .
this was a reaction channel expected for neutr@@ inos , but since only the number of Arg@@ on dec@@ ays was counted , it did not give any direc@@ tional information , such as where the neutr@@ inos came from .
the radio@@ chemical experim@@ ents were only sensitive to elec@@ tr@@ on neutr@@ inos , and the signal in the water Cer@@ en@@ kov experim@@ ents was dominated by the elec@@ tr@@ on neutr@@ ino signal .
= = = H@@ EP neutr@@ inos = = = The highest energy neutr@@ inos have not yet been observed due to their small f@@ lu@@ x compared to the bor@@ on @@@ -@@ @ 8 neutr@@ inos , so thus far only limits have been placed on the f@@ lu@@ x .
this should be possible thanks to SN@@ O + and , on the longer term , thanks to L@@ ena , two detec@@ tors that will be larger but will use the same principles of Bo@@ re@@ x@@ ino .
for this reason , a precise meas@@ urement of the bor@@ on @@@ -@@ @ 8 neutr@@ ino f@@ lu@@ x can be used in the framework of the standard solar model as a meas@@ urement of the temper@@ ature of the core of the S@@ un .

although this mechanism is the cause of individual no@@ c@@ ti@@ lu@@ cent cl@@ ou@@ ds , it is not thought to be a major contribut@@ or to the phenomenon as a whole .
as the mes@@ os@@ phere contains very little mo@@ ist@@ ure , approximately one hundred milli@@ on@@ th that of air from the Sa@@ har@@ a de@@ sert , and is extremely th@@ in , the ice cr@@ y@@ st@@ als can form only at temperatures below about .
systematic photo@@ graphic ob@@ serv@@ ations of the cl@@ ou@@ ds were organized in 18@@ 87 by J@@ es@@ se , Fo@@ er@@ ster , and St@@ ol@@ ze and , after that year , continuous ob@@ serv@@ ations were carried out at the Berlin Ob@@ ser@@ vatory .

they are very fa@@ int and ten@@ u@@ ous , and may be observed only in tw@@ il@@ ight around sun@@ rise and sun@@ set when the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow , but the no@@ c@@ ti@@ lu@@ cent cl@@ oud is ill@@ umin@@ ated by the S@@ un .
a pre@@ destination par@@ ad@@ o@@ x ( also called ca@@ usal lo@@ op , ca@@ us@@ ality lo@@ op , and , less frequently , closed lo@@ op or closed time lo@@ op ) is a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x of time travel that is often used as a convention in science fic@@ tion .

= = = C@@ ov@@ ar@@ i@@ ant and mixed forms = = = In most of this article we work with the contra@@ vari@@ ant form , " T " μ@@ ν of the stress @@@ -@@ @ energy ten@@ sor .
what this means is that the continuity equ@@ ation no longer imp@@ lies that the non @@@ -@@ @ gra@@ vit@@ ational energy and momentum expressed by the ten@@ sor are absolutely con@@ served , i@@ .@@ e@@ .
in the classical limit of New@@ ton@@ ian gra@@ vity , this has a simple interpre@@ tation : energy is being ex@@ changed with gra@@ vit@@ ational potential energy , which is not included in the ten@@ sor , and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies .
on the other hand , vis@@ cos@@ ity itself was not enough to explain the transport of an@@ gular momentum to the ex@@ ter@@ ior parts of the dis@@ c .
by using the equ@@ ation of hydro@@ st@@ atic equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um , combined with conserv@@ ation of an@@ gular momentum and assuming that the dis@@ c is th@@ in , the equ@@ ations of dis@@ k structure may be solved in terms of the formula _ 4 parame@@ ter .
using Kr@@ am@@ ers ' law for the op@@ ac@@ ity it is found that : formula _ 19 : formula _ 20 : formula _ 2@@ 1@@ where formula _ 22 and formula _ 23 are the mid @@@ -@@ @ plane temper@@ ature and den@@ s@@ ity respectively .
in the radi@@ atively inefficient case , the dis@@ k may " pu@@ ff up " into a tor@@ us or some other three @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional solution like an Ad@@ v@@ ection dominated Ac@@ cre@@ tion flow ( A@@ D@@ AF ) .
a simple system dis@@ playing this mechanism is a gas dis@@ c in the presence of a weak ax@@ ial mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
the in@@ ner f@@ lu@@ id element is then forced by the spring to slow down , reduce correspon@@ d@@ ingly its an@@ gular momentum causing it to move to a lower or@@ bit .
this process can concentr@@ ate the mag@@ ne@@ tic f@@ lu@@ x around the centre of the dis@@ c giving rise to very strong mag@@ ne@@ tic fields .
formation of powerful astro@@ physical j@@ ets along the ro@@ tation ax@@ is of acc@@ re@@ tion dis@@ ks requires a large scale pol@@ o@@ id@@ al mag@@ ne@@ tic field in the in@@ ner regions of the dis@@ c .

in a gener@@ ic system without sym@@ me@@ tries , a full qu@@ ant@@ um treatment would yield a discre@@ te non @@@ -@@ @ de@@ generate set of energy e@@ ig@@ en@@ states .
when we specify the internal energy to be U , what we really mean is that the total energy of the gas lies somewhere in an inter@@ val of length formula _ 8 around U@@ .
in other words , if there are two gas@@ es A and B and we have not yet discovered that they are different , then assuming they are the same will cause no the@@ ore@@ tical problems .
it di@@ ffers from the full calc@@ ulation in three ways : # The ideal gas consists of parti@@ c@@ les con@@ fined to one sp@@ ati@@ al dimension .

a mechan@@ ical equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um is a state in which a momentum co@@ ordinate of a parti@@ cle , ri@@ g@@ id body , or dynam@@ ical system is con@@ served .

more generally in conservative systems , equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um is established at a point in config@@ ur@@ ation space where the gra@@ di@@ ent with respect to the general@@ ized co@@ ordin@@ ates of the potential energy is zero .
