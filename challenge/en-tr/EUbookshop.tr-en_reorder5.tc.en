a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet.It can be accessed through the Europa server ( http : / / europa.eu.int ) .
Cedefop also operates an interactive website called the European Training Village : www.trainingvillage.gr
Foundation research reports can be downloaded free of charge directly from the website or ordered online at www.eurofound.eu.int.
the Foundation has a tripartite Administrative Board , made up of representatives from public authorities ( governments and the European Commission ) , employer organisations and trade unions .
we are a main information source for those involved in developing , adopting , implementing and evaluating environmental policy , as well as the general public .
: " the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is the hub of drug @-@ related information in the European Union .
among the Centre 's target groups are policy @-@ makers , who use this information to help formulate coherent national and Community drug strategies .
at the heart of the Centre 's work is the task of improving the comparability of drug information across Europe and devising the methods and tools required to achieve this .
: " the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) contributes to the protection of public and animal health by ensuring that medicines for human and veterinary use are safe , effective and of high quality .
the EMEA began its activities in 1995 , when the European system for authorising medicinal products was introduced providing for a centralised and a mutual recognition procedure .
the Community trade mark and the Community registered design are the gateway to a single market .
their unitary nature means that formalities and management can be kept simple : a single application , a single administrative centre and a single file to be managed .
the simplification results in considerably reduced costs as compared with the overall costs of national registration in all countries of the European Union .
an administrative board on which trade unions , employers " organisations , national governments and the European Commission are represented runs the Agency .
the EUMC operates a European information network on racism and xenophobia ( RAXEN ) which collects information at national level.Raxen consists of 25 national focal points , one in each EU Member State .
the information from the national focal points is published in the form of comparative reports or national reports .
the EUMC publishes an annual report in two parts , the first part provides information on the EUMC 's activities and the second part provides information on the situation of racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
: " the European Agency for Reconstruction is responsible for the management of the main EU assistance programmes in Serbia and Montenegro ( Republic of Serbia , Republic of Montenegro , UN @-@ administered Kosovo ) and FYR of Macedonia .
an independent agency of the European Union , it is accountable to the European Council and the European Parliament , and overseen by a governing board composed of representatives from the EU Member States and the European Commission .
the Board is responsible for establishing the Authority 's draft budget and work programmes , monitoring their implementation , and agreeing to internal rules and regulations.It also appoints EFSA 's Executive Director and the members of the Scientific Committee and panels .
the Executive Director is the legal representative of the Authority and answers to the Management Board.Appointed for five years , which are renewable , he is responsible for the day @-@ to @-@ day management of the Authority and all staff matters .
EFSA 's scientific opinions and advice are provided by the Scientific Committee ( SC ) and eight scientific panels , each competent in a specific area of risk assessment.The Scientific Committee coordinates the work of the panels and addresses transversal issues relevant to all ( e.g.methodology for exposure assessment ) .

preface he competition policy pursued by the European Commission has a direct impact on thedaily life of the citizens of the European Union .
whether they be consumers , savers , users of public services , employees or taxpayers , the Union 's citizens enjoy the fruits of the competition policy in thevarious aspects of their everyday life .
Requiringfirms to compete with each other fosters innovation , reduces production costs , increaseseconomic efficiency and , consequently , enhances the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @-@ à @-@ vis its main trading partners .
the propagation of thecompetitive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabric of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @-@ up to employment policies .
aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if , by favouring certain firms , it is liable to cause damage to their competitors in other Member States , which in some casesmight go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and , consequently , the jobs of their
only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Commissiongrant exemption from this general principle of prohibition .
in some cases , State aid merely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained artificially , or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being distorted .
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register listingall of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a scoreboard which would enableit to be seen whether Member States are complying with the State aid rules .
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and itsrepresentatives to become more involved in aid @-@ monitoring policy .
it enhances the quality and variety of goodsplaced on the market , fosters technological innovation and economic performance and , finally , promotes fair prices for users .
it also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on themarket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process .
in conclusion , the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage theactive participation of consumers and their organisations .
given their knowledge of the day @-@ to @-@ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @-@ market consumer goods , consumerorganisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which distort competition .
economic freedom , within a proper regulatory framework , is a precondition for the development of a free society .
it impacts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation ofsociety at large .
it is in this way that competition policy is a " people 's " policy .
the Community 's competition policy pursues a precise goal , which is to defendand develop effective competitionin the common market .
demand seeks thebest ratio between quality and pricefor the products it requires . the mostefficient response emerges as a result of a contest between suppliers .
thus , competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking thisbalance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
extent . competition is therefore a simple and efficientmeans of guaranteeing consumers a level of excellencein terms of the quality and price of products andservices .
this consolidates the Community 's industrial and commercial fabric so that itis able to confront the competitiveness of our mainpartners and to put Community firms in a position tosucceed in markets around the world .
on the basisof this body of law , competition policy focuses on four main areas of action .
• The control of mergers between firms ( e.g. a merger between two large groupswhich results in their dominating the market ) .
• The monitoring of State aid ( e.g. the prohibition of a State grant designed to keepa loss @-@ making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery ) .
it does not enter into play until such timeas trade between Member States is affectedby the practices in question .
Forexample , a price @-@ fixing agreement between Bakers in a given town will not haveany impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore notapplicable to this kind of situation .
in some cases , this power is shared with the Member States " own competitionauthorities and law courts ( articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it liesexclusivelywith the Commission ( merger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
by contrast , it is exclusive when the legislative provision inquestion expressly stipulates that this is the case .
for the control of large @-@ scalemergers , the Member States considered it necessary to create a one @-@ stop shop.They appointed the European Commission to that end .
finally , it should be added that most Member States have their own domesticlawsto counter anti @-@ competitive practices ( restrictive agreements , abuses of adominant position , and mergers ) .
in the area of its anti @-@ trustoperations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibitan agreement orto issue an injunctionthat a restrictive practice be stopped , but also to imposefineson firms found guilty of anti @-@ competitive conduct .
the amount of thesefinesis calculated according to the gravity and duration of the infringement.Some of the most serious practices are price cartels or abusive conduct by firmsholding a virtual monopoly .
an appeal against a Commission decision may be lodged with the Court of First Instance or the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
the most familiarexample is an agreement on prices , or cartel , whereby firms fix price levelsjointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition betweensuppliers to obtain competitive prices .
forms of distribution . in those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be reallycompetitive and have no incentive to innovate or reduce production costs .
the crisis thus affects employees , subcontractors and traders.Moreover , artificially high prices affect the costs of intermediate consumers , who are adversely affected by their suppliers " anti @-@ competitive behaviour .
the anti @-@ competitive behaviour of a few firms thus harms all operators andjustifies the intervention of the authorities .
if an agreement fulfils the following conditions , it is void : it is concluded between firms or " undertakings " ;
lastly , it may apply discriminatory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement , placing them at acompetitive disadvantage .
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exempted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distributionagreements for example .
in this case , the anti @-@ competitive practice harmed firms outside the cartel , which were systematically excludedfrom calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
the result of thisagreement , for the final consumer , was purchase prices that were higher thanthey would have been with free competition .
after the new venture has been set up , businesses such asbanks , supermarkets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers interactive services via television . access to the services will be through a decoder .
in this case , the Commissionsought to make it easier for new digital interactive television services to developwhile at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
efficient businesses are run with a view to conquering markets , to the pointwhere they may establish very strong positions indeed .
citizens have good reason to be apprehensive of abuses of this kind , whichresult in higher prices , restrictions on the availability of products and services and unfair trading conditions .
article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibits the abuse of a dominant position . for the article to apply , the following conditions must be fulfilled .
abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
the abuse consisted ofestablishing a system of brand loyalty , which meant that the market in airtransport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways 'competitors .
the effect of the system was toreinforce agencies " brand loyalty to British Airwaysand to discourage them from offering the services of
the Commission therefore considered that this practice , which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies , constituted an abuse of a dominant position .
abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Frenchcommittee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 1998.The committee , the CFO , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event thatincluded ticket sales .
the Commission found that the arrangements for ticketsales for the final matches were discriminatory and constituted an abuse of adominant position .
persons not resident in France who wished to see the finalswere thus at a severedisadvantage compared withpersons resident in France.The Commission thereforeruled against the CFO .
Mergers which create or strengthen a dominantposition , however , are prohibited by the Treaty inorder to prevent ensuing abuses . a firm is in adominant position when it is able to act on themarket without having to take account of thereaction of its competitors , suppliers orcustomers .
for example , such a firm can increaseits prices above those of its competitors withoutfearing any loss of profit .
all market players andespecially consumers stand to lose from theemergence of this kind of dominant structure , which is likely to result in higher prices , a narrower choice of goods or scarcityof innovation .
that is why the European Union has set up an advance vettingsystem for mergers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibit aplanned merger if necessary .
identical systems have been set up in the Member States for investigating mergers of national dimension .
it must be borne inmind that the Commission 's objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
it may be that , in the short term , efforts to improve the competitiveness of firms by means of mergers oracquisitions involve restructuring and thus loss of jobs .
the Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EUR 5 000 million ) and the Community @-@ wide threshold ( EUR 250 million ) .
• Mergers and acquisitions with a Community dimension have to be notified to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect .
since theentry into force of the merger regulation , the Commission has seen thenumber of notifications grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month , the Commission decides either to
regulation authorise the transaction or , if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened , to initiate a four @-@ month investigation procedure .
• At the end of this procedure , the Commission may authorise the merger
( more than 90 % ) .
in a market in the process of integration , mergers whichcreate or strengthen a dominant position are , in fact , quite rare .
Insome cases , the merger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen adominant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a solutionto the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
in both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Commissionconsidered that the merger of these retail chains would have created adominant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibit the transaction , while in the Austrian case it accepted the remedies proposed by the companies , which consisted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
the merger of Carrefour and Promodès was authorised subject to thedivestment of a majorshareholding in acompetitor .
but theanalysis of competitiveconditions at locallevel was left to thenational competitionauthorities , since themerger involved aseries of very localisedcompetition problems .
the Commission thus ensured thatcompetition waspreserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from achoice of outlets , attractive prices and a diverse range of consumer goods .
insurance policyholders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fromthe remedies proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
it would have given the new firm sizeableshares of the market for the supply of various life @-@ assurance products in Italy .
in addition , the investigation revealed links between the two firms and theirmain competitors that could have induced them to coordinate their behaviourin the insurance and investment fields .
the merging of theoperations of the two main players in the French petroleum products sector wouldhave created a dominant position onseveral markets . after the merger , TotalFina
the merging of theoperations of the twomain players in the French petroleumproducts sector wouldhave created a dominantposition on severalmarkets .
furthermore , the combination of TotalFina and elf service stations on French motorways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 % .
the Commission considered that this level of market power would have pushedup prices in a market where they were already high .
lastly , TotalFina and Elfwould have become the leader on the market for LPG , used for heating . in orderto resolve the competition problems identified , TotalFina / elf undertook to sell alarge proportion of the operations concerned to competitors .
in this way , the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remainedcompetitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply ofpetroleum products at fair prices .
however , the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service .
otherwise , from the point of view of Community law , they would createsituations that restrict competition .
the public authorities in the Member States may grantspecial rights , in particularmonopoly rights , to public orprivate undertakings toperform services of generaleconomic interest .
in these sectors , a distinction must be made between theinfrastructure and the services provided overthis infrastructure .
while it is often difficult toestablish a second , competing infrastructure , for reasons linked to investment costs andeconomic efficiency , it is possible and desirableto create competitive conditions in respect ofthe services provided .
the process of opening up these sectors tocompetition has a positiveimpact for intermediateusers , and also for finalconsumers .
in a sector of the economy which is experiencingrapid growth driven by the emergence of the Internet and of electroniccommerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source ofcompetitiveness and new jobs .
depending on the circumstances , it may itself adopt a European liberalisation directive , or propose that such a directive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament .
a directive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be attained by all Member States , one that each Member State will incorporate
EUR 510 million for the right to operate on the Spanish market , while Telefónica , the State operator , had been allowed to provide mobile telephone services without
advantage over its new competitor , enabling it tostrengthen its dominant position on the mobiletelephony market .
the Commission decided that there was no necessary relation betweenthe stated cultural policy objective of preserving pluralism in the Flemish printedpress and the granting in Flanders of a monopoly on commercial television to VTM .
Unsubsidised firms can even run intodifficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep theiremployees in jobs .
ultimately , then , the entire market will suffer from State aid , and the general competitiveness of the European economy is imperilled .
the Commission 's monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day @-@ to @-@ day life and offers three main beneficial effects .
by preventingdistortions of intra @-@ Community competition that would be deleterious to thesingle market , it boosts economic growth in the Union and promotesemployment as a result .
aid can take a variety of forms : grants and interest relief , of course , but also taxrelief .
aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding , or evenprovision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms .
- promote culture and heritage conservation ; where , in the last two cases , such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
the Commission has adopted a number of documents to clarify its State aid policy .
they concern regions lagging behind in terms of development , R & D , employment and training , small and medium @-@ sized businesses , protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty .
the Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such schemes as long as they do not distort competition to an extentincompatible with the common interest .
it isoften apprised of such schemes via complaints from firms . incompatible schemesare banned , and the offending Member State may well be required to recover thesums paid out .
certain forms of State financial support for firms can be anecessary means of tackling structural handicaps and excess costs flowing fromlocation in such areas .
the objective of this aid is to help alleviate or evenremove a number of problems ( employment , development , etc . ) facing certainurban areas .
it actedwith the twofold concern to preserve a company inthe process of return to viability on the air transportmarket without jeopardising competition : consumerswould benefit both from Alitalia 's services and from those of its competitors .
the effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness andemployment throughout the common market for the benefit of all thoseemployed in the motor industry .
in my local area , there are onlytwo large supermarkets , each belonging to one of the twochains in question .
at the moment , there is keen competitionbetween the two supermarkets in prices and promotional offers.Am I right in fearing that , after the merger , this situation willchange and local competition will disappear ?
community dimension , the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action .
difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other Member State .
my dealer has told me that I could not buy thevehicle abroad as the manufacturer forbids its dealers frommaking cross @-@ border sales .
petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in allthe petrol stations in my region .
it may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil , for example because of an international crisis .
where there is no explanation of thiskind , it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fillingstation owners or oil companies .
an investigation would have to be conducted todetermine whether or not this was the case .
I usuallytake a ferry run by the Ulysses line , which offers the mostattractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question .
the combination of a price rise and the alignment of prices between the threecompanies - the only three operating at the port - would seem to indicateconcerted action by the three firms .
in the face of redundancies , what justification is there for the Commission
the firm is going to have to payback the aid to the government .
however , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the viability of firms . on the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms recover a lasting vitality .
thus , aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid .
however , the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty , provided that it leads to the long @-@ term restoration of the firms " competitiveness .
private firms have different objectives from publicservices and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promptthese firms to abandon unprofitable activities or to be lessrigorous on matters of safety and public health .
in some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liberalisationhas clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geographically remote areas .
so the public has gained agreat deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .
if you find that competition is appreciably affected as a result , you may file a complaint .
you may bring the problem to the attention of a consumer organisation.If the restriction of competition appreciably affects the common market , it is likely that the consumer organisation will already have received a number of similar complaints or letters .
European associations and submit a duly substantiated complaint . it may file a complaint on behalf of consumers in the Union and establish the Community interest in the case .
# authorities , it would seem preferable to choose this collective course of action .
when addressing a complaintto the European Commission , whether it be an individual or a collective complaint , a simple letterwill suffice .

the second step is to estimate howlarge these benefits are ( e.g. how many cases will be avoided ) .Finally , the monetary value of the benefits is evaluated ( e.g. howmuch would the damages avoided be worth ) .
the benefits are estimated using several methods , for examplecalculating the " avoided damage " : the reduction in cases of asthma or use of primary materials .
the figures span a very wide range , simply because it is extremely difficult , for example , to measure the impact of air pollution . Inthe same way , it is almost impossible to give a monetary value toa human life .

regional development : an important step towards
December 2005 : an important milestone for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its path to becoming a member of the European Union .
as Bulgaria reaches towards its future within the EU , funding under the structural policy for pre @-@ accession is helping one town modernise its environmentally contaminating waste disposal and water systems .

regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding
in this article we look at how the original pre @-@ accession assistance has taken on new dimensions .
investment was implemented through the Instrument for
( 1 ) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1085 / 2006 , adopted on 17 July 2006 .
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU Member States and regions under Cohesion Policy instruments .
a significant share of IPA funds managed by the DGs for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon @-@ type expenditure ( roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation , depending on the country ) .
components III , IV and V are open to candidate countries only ( namely the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
their design mirrors closely the management and programming principles of structural , cohesion and rural development funds .
by gaining first @-@ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absorb future structural , cohesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
in this relatively short period ( programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year ) , essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Component III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a fraction of the level of investment assistance available to Member States2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in devising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of Structural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 444 000 inhabitants
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @-@ accession assistance , a precursor to the Structural and Cohesion Funds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
one of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans .
heavy pollution caused by non @-@ treated waste water , as well as non @-@ treated urban and industrial water , is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants .
is article focuses on the first of these elements , which will support up to 12 programmes between the Member States and ( potential ) candidate countries ( see map ) .
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Secretariat staffed from both sides of the border .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river basins like the Danube and Tisza , could be developed in the IPA crossborder programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , crossborder area .
finally , there is another layer of benefits that should also be taken into account - these can be described as the institutional benefits for the ( potential ) candidate countries .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future Structural Funds implementation , the IPA crossborder programmes will mirror Structural Funds rules as closely as possible. is means firstly that the programmes are run on a multiannual basis .
from the vantage point of one of the town 's outflows , discharging around 240 000 litres a second , ' Blue Danube ' seems to be a misnomer .
all this is set to change by the end of 2010 , when the results of Bulgaria 's most extensive water project take effect .
it will deliver : new , more efficient pumps ; 10 replacement hydrophores ensuring constant supply to the town 's high @-@ rise buildings ;

once air dried and subjected to four phases of anaerobic treatment , the sludge ends up in a digester tank where the resulting methane produced will be collected and stored in a 900 m2 gas holder .
eleven collectors will be rationalised into one central collector which will direct the waste into a state of the art treatment plant , putting an end to a centuries old practice of uncontrolled discharge .

although starting up while Bulgaria was still a candidate for accession , the projects continued as planned , after the country had become a member of the EU .
it was not only the status of the country in its relation to the EU that underwent a change - the funding instrument changed its name , becoming the Instrument for Pre @-@ Accession Assistance ( IPA ) .
• 2004 @-@ 06 : Bulgaria and Romania are beneficiary countries of ISPA , Croatia since 1 January 2005 .
the Republic of Croatia is a good example of a candidate country facing up to the challenges of accession .
Croatia started the accession negotiations in October 2005 and , providing all pre @-@ accession criteria are met , is hoping to complete the process by the end of 2009 .

from 1990 onwards , Croatia took major steps to adapt to a functioning market economy. is was a great starting point , but there was still a long way to go to meet EU economic targets .
Croatia 's natural beauty is a potential source of economic riches .
e legacy of the 1990s investment climate. ese goals will be met more easily and quickly by improving national administrative efficiency at the same time , encouraging cluster development and establishing e @-@ business centres throughout the country .

investment Priorities e End Game e first investment priority therefore focuses on building infrastructure in 10 of the least developed counties , combined with human resources investments to strengthen the underlying business environment .
in this last phase of pre @-@ accession , Croatian SMEs are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness .
unless this is dealt with now , such weaknesses could repeatedly crop up in the brave new world of the Single European Market .
Prof. Dr Yavuz CABBAR , Head of Operating Structure at the Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade , explains how the economy is developing through the 2007 @-@ 2010 Operational Programme of the IPA .
geographically , the Programme concentrates on the regions where income per capita is below 75 % of the Turkish national
average ( 12 NUTS1 II Regions ) .
within these regions , there is a strong focus on the 15 Growth Centres which have been identified in the Strategic coherence Framework .
it then attributes a competitiveness index for each region by applying a coefficient to each one. e result is a map showing differing levels of competitiveness between regions. is is then colour coded into five groups , where the lightest shade represents the lowest level of competitiveness .
on the next graphic , the Competitiveness Map has been modified to show solely the target regions of the RCOP and three groups of regions with a similar level of competitiveness .
it has been difficult , but all the pieces are now in place for some exciting economic developments , as well as providing the tools for evaluating future projects under the IPA .
in regions with high competitiveness , the measures are targeted at increasing added value , and coping with
advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional , management and control capacities .
e conclusion of the verification audit is that the overall system for the management and control of IPA program is compliant with the requirements .

CBC projects are based on a big vision for building wider European cooperation and integration which will in turn achieve sustainable development in border regions. e main priorities are economic development , social cohesion and improving the quality of life .
e first programme to be approved by the European Commission on 14 December 2007 was between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
a wide variety of projects were successfully implemented under the Neighbourhood Programme .
here are just a couple of examples among many .
aside from the formality of the measures , it 's encouraging to think of real people coming together from different organisations and communities with common goals to achieve .
joint activities were introduced in the sphere of health protection and improving the quality of life of young people in the crossborder region .
economic gains by themselves would be hollow if they did not also ensure sustainable growth and the preservation and development of natural and cultural resources , which constitute key assets in this border region .
e real start of the programme - the first call for proposals - will be launched during the last quarter of 2008 , when applicants will be able to send their project proposals to the programme secretariat in Kyustendil .
cooperation and networking programmes met for the first time in the context of the inform network1 coordinated by the European Commission 's Directorate @-@ General for Regional Policy .
European citizens ' perception of Regional Policy e meeting 's purpose was for members to get to know each other and discuss current and future actions .
participants agreed that measuring the impact of EU activities and also the effectiveness of publicity measures via public surveys is one of the most objective methods5. e surveys , accompanied by analysis , also draw lessons for the more efficient promotion of EU structural interventions .
it began with a presentation by Anna Bugalska ( Ministry for Regional Development , Poland ) of the campain " Poland Growing Beautiful ! e " Seven miracles of EU funds " competition , " which provided the basis for discussion and raised various questions .
Mr Hall highlighted the new requirement to publish a list of project beneficiaries showing the amount of EU and other public funding allocated. is ties in with the ongoing drive to improve transparency in the Union and , critically , to raise the profile of EU @-@ funded projects .
following the comments received during the day , future meetings will evolve towards a 1.5 / 2day format , providing more time for networking and in @-@ depth discussions among inform members .
greater prominence will be given to Territorial Cooperation programmes .

a number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries .
within the Lisbon process , enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010 .
in this context , the European Commission has set up an expert group on " Improving the Education of Teachers and trainers . "
the group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accreditation of the initial and inservice education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education .
concern for quality assurance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the followup of the Bologna Process .
they should also commit themselves explicitly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assurance , in their work . "
in light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes , the European Commission asked Eurydice in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries .
the present comparative study carried out with reference to the replies obtained from these questionnaires , has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eurydice Network member countries ( 1 ) .
they describe the various players involved , as well as their qualifications , the documents which have to be used in identifying criteria , the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequency .
however , the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next .
if information is available on current quality assurance practices , it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report .
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
it may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms , as shown in the examples below .
in the United Kingdom ( Wales ) , a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government has been underway since 2005 .
this looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system , rather than just within a specific institution .
in 24 countries or regions , only general regulations for the evaluation of all higher education apply to the evaluation of teacher education ( Figure 1.1 ) .
apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accreditation of higher education , no specific evaluation systems are geared to teacher education .
in Germany , specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final " on @-@ the @-@ job " qualifying ( induction ) phase , which is organised by the teacher training institutes ( Studienseminare ) .
in Poland , teacher education provided by universities is evaluated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education , whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training colleges .
in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , there are separate arrangements , established by law , for the school inspectorates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education .
additional notes Belgium ( BE de ) : the figure relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education ( including initial teacher education ) .
as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evaluations are often very closely interrelated ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out externally .
in several countries , regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure , including external and / or internal evaluation . there are various reasons for this : different components or stages of education
however , in 2001 , the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review , which was repeated in 2004 .
evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evaluators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies ; the frequency of external evaluation .
in Cyprus , Poland ( in the case of teacher training colleges ) and Iceland , the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation .
in Spain , the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members .
legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation .
the " guidelines for initial Teacher Education courses " in Scotland give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes , the amount of school experience and compulsory programme elements .
the " Standard for initial Teacher Education : benchmark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have attained at the end of their programmes .
the Evaluation Framework for the Accreditation of Programmes of initial Teacher Education and the Arrangements for the Accreditation of Programmes of initial Teacher Education give detailed guidance on how the accreditation process works .
however , these countries have all adopted lists of criteria , some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education .
in Latvia , for example , the Higher Education Quality Evaluation Centre has developed a questionnaire for evaluation experts , which consists of questions regarding the main quality aspects to be evaluated .
figure 2.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the external evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
United Kingdom : the information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
the committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analysed which have yielded contradictory findings , or which seem especially important , are unclear or are not sufficiently conclusive .
classroom observation ( in the institution providing initial teacher education ) cannot be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation .

Poland : ( 1 ) relates to external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
regular evaluations for the renewal of accreditation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the preceding evaluation .
Denmark : the Center for Videregående Uddannelse are given the possibility to participate in a single accreditation process allowing them to obtain the quality label of University Colleges .
Germany : only evaluations of bachelor 's- and master 's @-@ type programmes are used for the purpose of accreditation ( or re @-@ accreditation ) .
France : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation carried out by the des ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation carried out by the CNE and the IGAENR .
this will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements .
this is an exceptional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education ( see chapter 1 ) .
in Wales , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspections by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SCT ) : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occurs at regular intervals and another whose frequency varies .
in Denmark , programme evaluation may be conducted by Eva ( Danish Evaluation Institute ) on its own initiative and upon the request of , for example , the government , ministries , advisory boards , local authorities and establishments .
in Germany , external evaluation is carried out on the initiative of universities and teacher training centres , or the ministry of education in the case of teacher training institutes ( Studienseminare ) ( see Chapter 4 , Section 4.1 ) .
the legislation of the different Länder states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specifying its frequency .
in Spain , the ANECA issues a call for applications , annually or every two years , from higher education institutions wishing to be evaluated .
the decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution .
in Austria , external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education , Science and Culture .
internal evaluation ( self @-@ evaluation ) of teacher education may BE defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible .
internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhancement in so far as it is a collective appraisal of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned .
an overview of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the annex .
in the Czech Republic , Germany ( in the case of teacher training institutes ) , Poland , Slovenia and Iceland ( for the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions ) , the responsibility for Coordination lies mainly with the management of the institution .
however , in some Länder , it may also include administrators from the office of teacher training ( Amt für Lehrerbildung ) or similar institutions in the Länder , and staff from the teacher training institutes to be evaluated .
in universities in Poland , the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation .
in teacher training colleges , internal evaluation is carried out by the college council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rector / dean .
in some institutions , there is a special quality manager , while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council .
in Bulgaria , the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution .
Cyprus : the Figure relates solely to the internal evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Hungary : ( 1 ) relates to annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that takes place prior to external evaluation .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
these experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution , or simply give methodological / technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in Figure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the faculties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should consist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
it is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members .
in Hungary , the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years .
the student self @-@ governing body may delegate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
in Iceland , the committee should comprise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff , students and administration .
chapter 3 -Internal Evaluation of initial Teacher Education
Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation , including the institution 's non @-@ academic staff , external stakeholders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere , and former graduates of the institution .
in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , it is compulsory for people external to the faculty or school offering the programme and for people from outside the institution to take part in the annual evaluation .
in Romania , it is recommended that representatives of the institution 's best graduates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of Pedagogical university colleges and universities .
in Malta , for example , all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questionnaires or interviews with their students .
external experts from abroad serving as moderators are invited to review both the course content and assessed assignments . they may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements .
in Slovenia , the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the dean for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers , administrators and student representatives .
virtually all of the foregoing types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium , Greece , Lithuania and Poland .
almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation , always in conjunction with several of the other documents referred to above .
in almost all cases , the use of such documents is compulsory , except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania , where their use is recommended .
the second , the Guía de Autoevaluación ( self @-@ evaluation guide ) , is intended to facilitate the start of the selfevaluation phase .
in Slovakia , the list of criteria developed by the Accreditation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accreditation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general .
while the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is optional in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , internally devised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
figure 3.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification frameworks for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom , although there are no specific regulations to this effect , the use of external evaluation results for internal evaluation is expected .
in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the outcomes of the General Teaching Council for Scotland process will in turn feed back into the internal quality assurance processes of the university .
however , there is no explicit mention of this having to happen - simply an expectation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation , most cover all ( or almost all ) of the above @-@ mentioned issues .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curriculum is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
as well as the quality of teaching , other areas of interest were the organisational structure , administration , tasks of the department , research , the provision of services , public relations and the development plan .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropriateness of the course workload and the teachers ' and assistants " ability to deliver the course .
the global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for gauging how students ' perceptions vary over time or across disciplines , and for comparing student performance .
Latvia : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of a higher education institution for its accreditation , ( 2 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for accreditation , and ( 3 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for reaccreditation .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school placements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the selfevaluation report .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in 13 countries and regions , there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) , internal evaluation is expected but is not explicitly required .
Greece : the information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
in ten countries or regions , higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed intervals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years .
Alternatively , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evaluations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
in Ireland , internal evaluation , which has to be carried out every ten years , results in external evaluation of the quality assurance procedures adopted by higher education institutions .
in the nine countries or regions in which the frequency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations , different scenarios are possible .
Iceland : higher education institutions are obliged to introduce an internal quality assurance system , which may take a variety of forms .
internal evaluation occurring only once , to enable new programmes or institutions to be accredited for the first time , is not covered .
inadequate quality may , for example , mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures , which may be subject to followup evaluation .
penalties are also possible , as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications , or when its funding is adjusted .
over and above their consequences for institutions , the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff , students and the general public .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the availability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
in just five countries or regions ( the French Community of Belgium , Denmark , Ireland , Austria and Finland ) , these aspects derive only marginally from regulations - if at all .
it is intended that they should - entirely on their own initiative - introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation ( which remain confidential ) .
however , in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation .
in the majority of countries , the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the ( re- ) accreditation of institutions or programmes .
in Lithuania , evaluations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are geared as a priority to enhancing quality , but their results also feed into a ( re- ) accreditation process .
if the results are not satisfactory , the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance .
the level of funding may also vary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) .
the results of these evaluations are taken into account notably during negotiations to renew the four @-@ year public funding contract .
this generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which varies from one country to the next .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re- ) accreditation decisions , conditional or temporary accreditation may be awarded in the case of non @-@ compliance with accreditation requirements .
in the Czech Republic , if the accreditation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions , the faculty has to submit ( generally within two years ) a report on the fulfilment of imposed conditions .
the publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education .
in Austria , the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations , which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general .
in practice in this country , evaluation results are usually made available to the stakeholders .
publication of evaluation reports from each institution / programme
publication of evaluation reports from each institution / programme
for schools in partnership with the institution concerned
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) relates to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) relates to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
Slovenia : according to internal institutional rules , internal evaluation results are published on the website of the faculty concerned .
they are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission .
in 11 countries , the results have to be available to academic staff and students .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursues several aims .
it is intended to help control the system , provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance .
it implies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .

Germany : only the results of external evaluations to ( re- ) accredit bachelor 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nationally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in several countries , the design of inservice education programmes has become completely decentralised and is the responsibility of schools .
as a consequence , schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illustrated in the examples below .
in Greece and Cyprus , public authority inservice teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision .
in Norway , higher education institutions are the sole providers of inservice teacher education .

Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
these two projects are currently being implemented .
Lithuania : draft regulations on the evaluation of inservice teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval .
their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006 . Iceland : evaluation of higher education institutions providing inservice teacher education has not yet been carried out .
in these two countries , regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
the contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants .
although no regulations exist in Cyprus , evaluation of inservice education programmes is conducted by the Pedagogical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture .
in Malta , organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questionnaires .
furthermore , in England , the Training and Development Agency for Schools has an extended remit covering inservice education for teachers .
in Spain , depending on the legislation of the Autonomous Community concerned , the evaluation of inservice teacher education providers consists of different elements .
those referred to as " compulsory " in Figure 5.2 are common to all Autonomous Communities , whereas those termed " optional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
Ireland : data refer to both the external evaluation of a sample of inservice teacher education courses and the periodic evaluation of inservice teacher education providers .
Italy : ( 1 ) refers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @-@ sector training providers .
Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a compulsory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accreditation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e.g. an audit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspectorate specifically established for school education or inservice teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accreditation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of inservice teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 Länder .
as regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task .
an agency for evaluation or an evaluation committee
the ministry of education , a ministry department or commission
Finland : Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider .
in Hungary , the process occurs at three levels . at preparatory level , the organiser of the programme asks an expert from the National Register of Experts to give an opinion on it .
in a second stage , an expert from the Pedagógus @-@ továbbképzési Akkreditációs Testület ( In @-@ service Teacher Training Accrediting Body ) evaluates the programme in accordance with a guideline based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
in Poland , depending on the course evaluated , two different bodies carry out evaluation .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practising teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during afternoons , weekends or summer .
the heads of regional education authorities ( kuratoria ) , which are subordinate to the ministry , evaluate and accredit qualification courses offered by all other providers .
in the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland , the inspectorate is part of the ministry of education .
an inspectorate for inservice teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @-@ Service Teacher Training ) , where it participates in evaluation along with other bodies .
in the French Community of Belgium , the Institut de la formation en cours de carriere , a community @-@ wide institution , organises and evaluates inservice teacher education , notably through its operators .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in Figure 5.4 are not usually covered .

Inservice teacher education abroad
in the majority of them , the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and / or the competences of the trainers are taken into account .
the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
consistency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects .
in Ireland , evaluation also focuses on the relevance of the course to the primary school curriculum and the extent to which the activity complies with official policy and guidelines .
the detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organiser .
moreover , evaluation analyses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
programmes are then accredited for five years . if providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year , they must go through the accreditation procedure again .
programme providers are also required to carry out selfevaluation procedures .
furthermore , the SuliNova Kht ( a non @-@ profit organisation ) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educational Authorities ( kuratoria ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of inservice teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the REA
in Slovenia , according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004 / 05 school year , only part of inservice courses are accredited each year .
the results of the accreditation and evaluation of inservice education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( Chapter 4 ) .
in the Czech Republic , accreditation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Accreditation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredited programmes during the period of accreditation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Latvia , the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements .
in Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accreditation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for inservice courses to be channelled into other training institutions .
this accreditation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @-@ making with respect to the goals , processes and instructors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accreditation results are published on the website of the Nederlands @-@ Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie ( NVAO , or Accreditation Organisation of The Netherlands and Flanders ) .
these reports are then sent to the Council for Programmes of Continuing Education and Training of Professional Staff of Schools and kindergartens .
on the basis of these reports , an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education .
in Romania , accredited teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the inservice training course that they must attend every five years .
these reforms have been referred to in previous chapters .
many countries have begun reforms of the organisation of initial teacher education and inservice training sometimes in relation to the Bologna process , or are intending to do so .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adapt procedures for evaluating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
the introduction of the two @-@ cycle ( bachelor / master ) structure in several Länder in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be structured in modules , accredited and therefore evaluated beforehand .
the previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were complied with .
ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and inservice education is examining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achieves its aims .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of inservice teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
in the case of quality assurance , recommendations should be submitted to the Welsh Assembly Government by January 2007 .
at or near the end of this period of study , they enrol in a programme of initial professional training , enabling them to qualify as teachers .
Synonyms : assessment , audit , peer review , quality assessment , review .
they describe the characteristics of the requirements and conditions to be met , and therefore provide the ( quantitative and / or qualitative ) basis on which an evaluative conclusion is drawn .
external evaluation : the process whereby a specialised external body collects data , information and evidence about an institution or a programme , in order to make a statement about its quality .
internal evaluation : a process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution , consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students , lecturers and other staff .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curriculum of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be attained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredited or certified .

the potential tasks are ranked by priority on the basis of both the results of the risk analysisand the need to ensure a balanced coverage of budgetary areas .
adding value to financial management
Thisincludes making suggestions on how to cost @-@ effectively : improve compliance with legislation ; reduce the risk of errors and irregularities ; improve the organisation of European Union activities and its internal control systems ; make the European Union 's actions more transparent by improving accounting methods and procedures ; andachieve EU policy objectives more effectively and efficiently .
irregularities and fraud
the European Court of Auditors reports on any irregularities and suspectedfraud .
the Treaty also requires that the Court of Auditors be requested to give a formal opinionon each proposal tointroduce or amend legislation with a financial impact , including the fight against fraud .
the objectiveis to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the relevantrules andregulations , that they exist in reality , have been correctly calculated and that the beneficiaries of EU aid havefulfilled their obligations .
assessment of the functioning of the internal control systems ( particularly the supervisory systems ) both at the Commission and in Member and beneficiary States ; Audit evidencebased on the testing of a sample of transactions from each budgetary field ; evidence arising from the audits of EU finances carried out by other auditors ; and Examination of the annual activity reports and declarationsissued by the Directors @-@ General of the European Commission .
value for money : have the funds been managed in an economic , efficient and effective manner , providingvalue for money for the citizens of the Union ?
the Court , in common with other public audit bodies , has two different approaches to sound financial managementaudits , depending on the topic under audit and the risks involved .
the first approach is to evaluate the management of the expenditure , and particularly the measures taken to achievevalue for money .
the audit concludes on whether the approach takenby management was likely to ensure value for money , and if not , how it could be improved .
this involves an examination of whether , and how , the objectives of the specific expenditure wereachievedand an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome .
the audit concludes onwhether value for money was achieved for the programme , and if not , how it could be improved .
financial audit -reliability of theaccounts
reality of operations the transaction is justified by an event which pertains to the body and is proper to the period
economy the resources are made available at the appropriatetime , are sufficient in quantity , are adequate in quality and are obtained for the lowest possible cost
the multiannual plan allows the Court 's strategy to be defined and updated , and the annualplan sets out the specific tasks to be undertakenduring the year in question .
for every audit undertaken , the auditors prepare an audit planning memorandum which sets out the audit scope , approach and objectives , and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost @-@ effective way .
it includes detailsof the human and other resources needed to complete the task and practical information such as countries to be visitedand how audit evidence is to be collected , as well as the audit timetable .
the auditors collect evidence in accordance withthe audit programme , both within the European Union institutions and on @-@ the @-@ spot in Member and beneficiary States .
the type of evidence needed depends on the transactionor audit subject in question and , in particular , on the conditions for receiving the EU aid .
however , the extent of this testing can be reduced when reliance is placed on the internal control systems , where it is possible and economic to do so .
if the audit testing shows that the systems are well conceived and operating effectively , the amount of direct testingof transactions necessary to meet the audit objectives can be reduced .
the purpose of the statement is to allow the auditees to confirm the factual accuracy of the Court 's audit findingsand to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explanations that may be necessary .
the purpose of audit reports is to communicate the results of the Court 's work to the auditee , the discharge authorityand the general public .

it was on this premise , and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) was established in 1993 .
this is essential reading for policymakers , scientists and practitioners in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .

monitoring the drug situation
the EMCDDA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e.g. key indicators , core datasets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpret the drug phenomenon .
as well as monitoring the drug situation today , the EMCDDA is ever vigilant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .
this publication of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) and the Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States ( CICAD @-@ OAS ) is protected by copyright .
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet .
starting from a highly heterogeneous group of drugs observatories across different continents , the endeavour is to extract the essence of their experience and to transmit the final result in such a way that it can be reinterpreted in other realities and conditions .
although this is the outcome of a long elaboration and reflection process , the handbook itself should be considered more as a starting point , rather than as a final achievement .
these are only a few of the questions that this handbook tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
one of the first consequences of this formalised approach was an acknowledgement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and observatories .
since the mid @-@ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @-@ based policy @-@ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
this change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
whilst the political responsibility remains in the hands of decision @-@ makers , there is a growing consensus that they need objective , factual , reliable and comparable information in order to take informed decisions .
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Interamerican Drugs Observatory CICAD @-@ OAS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national observatories ;
• non @-@ EU countries involved in a cooperation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the reader of the following in relation to this publication :
although it presents a conceptual framework , it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago , and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then .
• we do not offer a single model to be copied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sorts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a structured analysis of each national context .
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policymaking and for the organisation of drug @-@ related services , and on drug @-@ related issues of general interest ;
a national drugs observatory ( NDO ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and
) , and their consequences .
according to national priorities , the scope of the work of the NDO may focus only on illicit drugs , or could also cover alcohol , tobacco and other licit drugs ( such as prescription drugs ) .
national audience : the NDO addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level : decision @-@ makers , the scientific community , professionals working in the drugs field , and the general public .
as far as the work of an NDO is concerned , we use the term " core functions " to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the NDO .
in order to present the core functions of an NDO , we have adapted the concept of " business process . "
depending on the resources and the mandate of the NDO , and on the data and expertise available in the country , a range of possible set @-@ ups are possible , as presented in Chapter 7 - Challenging questions ) .
in order to gather , produce , analyse and disseminate information in a regular manner , the NDO must build a sustainable network that is able to work continuously on its own improvement .
one of the main tasks of the NDO is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map .
science , and our knowledge and understanding of the drugs phenomenon , are also in constant evolution .
in other words , developing the drug information network , and the related networking tasks , is part of an ongoing process that represents the NDO 's principal and most time @-@ consuming activity .
in most cases , the main publication produced by the NDO on a yearly basis will be a national report or an executive summary of the latest developments in the national context .
it is of particular importance that the NDO provides an update of the national drugs situation yearly , both for national and for international purposes .
in addition to the national report , the NDO may also be expected to produce reports on ad hoc studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans .
a critical issue for the development and strengthening of the NDO lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other publications in cooperation with its national and local partners .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 supranational organisations , called the Lisbon consensus (
OAS ) , the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , the World Health Organization , the International Epidemiology Workgroup and the Global HIV Prevention Research Network .
• Drug @-@ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; proportion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; proportion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
based on this list , each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment , but the core data remain the same .
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transposition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
) is structured so as to cover two main areas : " monitoring the situation " which covers epidemiology , crime and markets , and " monitoring responses " which covers interventions , law and policies .
they are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions .
the data sources employed to calculate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the routine information systems used in the country .
the treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
according to the situation outside Europe , it may be necessary to collect data on other infectious diseases that are related directly or indirectly to drug use or drugs users , such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections .
drug seizures can be as much an indicator of law enforcement activity in terms of supply reduction as they are of drug availability , but if cross @-@ checked with qualitative information they may be a confirmation of drug flows .
the guiding principle of this new classification is the target population by assumptions concerning its risk for substance abuse , but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention , as was the case previously .
the EMCDDA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interventions that Member States have established to protect drug users from further exclusion and to improve their social inclusion .
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons ; • law @-@ enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offenders , and ;
• law @-@ enforcement measures especially targeting statutory diversions addressed at young offenders , in order to avoid their progression into the criminal justice system .
in addition , the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development : emergency rooms ; treatment centres ; and mortality associated with drug use .
Epidemiological research forms the foundation the OID 's work in Latin America and the Caribbean , and is the sine qua non of any drug information system .
building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook solid epidemiology based network in each country , leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region .
the OID programme estimates the human social and economic costs of drugs in the
the methodology is based on the " International guidelines for estimating the costs of Drug Abuse " ( 11 ) ; published by the Canadian Centre on substance
to further this effort , the OID is embarking on a collaborative endeavor with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to develop a methodological tool to
although local data collection may already exist , the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub @-@ regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation .
however , a problem frequently encountered is that this information is not collected in a coordinated and systematic manner , which may be compounded when some of the actors involved do not work together .
data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analysed .
to identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important .
once the relevant contact people have been identified , this summary document should be sent to them , in order to prepare the first meeting .
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " elevator pitch " in Chapter 6 ) .
indeed , at the start of the information map process , the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explanatory document .
people can facilitate or slow down the process , either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility .
by " system , " we mean a structured organisation of heterogeneous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation .
the elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hierarchical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding .
• the process of constructing the system must be documented and monitored : this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system ( NAPDIS - see P . 46 ) .
this may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the NDO , for instance for drafting the national report .
the next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system ( NAPDIS ) , in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken .
the NAPDIS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come .
therefore , what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available .
• Data collection : it is the responsibility of the NDO to identify gaps and needs for additional data collection exercises , and to convey this information to the national authorities .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the EMCDDA 's five key epidemiological indicators ;
with the NAPDIS , the NDO and its partners identifies what needs to be done long @-@ term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework , using the information map as a starting point .
however it is important to bear in mind that knowing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are merely long @-@ term goals .
once the NAPDIS is endorsed by its main stakeholders , then the NDO can prepare a yearly work programme .
the relationship between the partners is non @-@ hierarchical , but the network exists around a project which is coordinated under the leadership of the NDO .
it is the role of the NDO to keep the project on track , steering the collaborative process towards a common goal .
contributions by partners , especially in deliverables produced by the NDO , should be acknowledged ; competences available in the network should be used and recognised .
for networks being established following the initiative or request of the NDO and / or the national authorities , the Coordination role of the NDO should be two @-@ way .
• the Inter @-@ Ministerial Drug Committee ( funding of NDO staff who coordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met )
• other national organisations for some ad hoc surveys and / or qualitative studies among drug users • laboratories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of coordinator of the whole network .
when possible , on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise , establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see Figure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Present the missions of the NDO and the national drug information network : the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• Try to arrange a meeting every 1 @-@ 2 years with your partners to share information , discuss the conclusions of your reports , and reflect about current trends .
the NDO has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected .
improving the quality of information on drug @-@ related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information , or capacity building .
• Carry out a formal review of data quality and availability at national level with an expert panel • compare results with international guidelines and standards
16 ) See online toolbox at : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / publications / joint / ndo @-@ handbook
• working with quantitative data ; • analysing qualitative information ; • interpreting and putting together all sources of information .
it is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting .
while the data collected through surveys or through government records allow for some kind of measurement , there are some areas or some aspects of the drugs situation that cannot be directly measured .
2 inform about " (
Metadata give us insight as to how data were collected , what they describe and refer to , and about the reliability and comparability of the information provided .
is this study part of other sets of studies that are being compared , or is it a one @-@ off study ?
Metadata are as important as the data themselves , and should be stored and kept updated by the national drugs observatory , under what is sometimes called the " statistical metadata system . "
when the NDO identifies problems on compatibility of definitions and their application with international standards and protocols , it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discrepancies and try to find solutions .
where sampling has been employed , the method of sampling can determine whether the sample is representative of the target population , or some subset ( 3 ) .
central to which probabilistic sampling method is employed is the availability or not of a coherent sample frame , or listing of the target population .
Probabilistic methods , correctly implemented , allow generalisations to be made to the population listed in the sample frame , with statements of sampling error in the form of confidence intervals .
if in principle the study findings are to be generalisable , it is necessary to ensure that the sample is representative .
different disciplines may make reference to different types of validity , however with quantitative studies , what is important to ensure is that :
• the measure is relevant to the study population ; • the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject ;
while assessing the validity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible biases , or non @-@ random or systematic errors , entering into the data .
this criterion relates to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results .
was there any decision taken by the interviewers that may influence or affect the sampling method ?
the NDO is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received , and / or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data .
scientific objectivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the NDO and its partners - any compromise would undermine the viability of the whole system .
qualitative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quantitative information , by further exploring :
• interpreting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing insight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @-@ using patterns ; • assessing the context in which interventions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interventions ; • understanding new drug using phenomena ; • providing insight into drugs markets .
the NDO plays an important role in making an inventory of such research results in its country , and in integrating these results in its analysis and reports .
it can also identify the areas where additional qualitative research is needed , and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available .
qualitative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques , and determining how to judge the quality of a qualitative study will depend on the approach adopted .
efforts have been made to develop criteria within qualitative research which are accepted broadly as replacements for what quantitative researchers call validity and reliability .
the strength of qualitative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object , precluding the notion of a common truth .
generally , qualitative studies are not interested in an " average " - they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals .
in any case , we need to understand how the sample was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions .
describing methods is not an easy task in qualitative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sensible and adequate way of addressing the research question .
• Was attention given to the reliability of inter @-@ observers and to the validity of findings ?
• - with other parts of the study ; • - with the results of other studies performed in the same environment ?
the information from key informants is never unbiased ; it is influenced by their position , their personal , political , or cultural interests : what is their motivation ?
• Does the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
• Who authored and who reviewed the study ?
6 working @-@ day and seasonal variation from a time series (
• developments in the music culture ( increase in popularity of music cultures that are associated with drug consumption ) ;
such studies can be used as additional sources of information , keeping in mind that the results cannot simply be transferred to other populations .
reliability and validity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for error , lie in two broad areas : at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level .
a number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
to ensure sustainability and " buy @-@ in , " it is vital that the NDO ensures that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stakeholders and audiences - both at national and supranational level .
in the long run , a failure to build visibility and to demonstrate the added value of the NDO will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility .
this is one aspect of the NDO 's reporting that may sometimes be underestimated , for instance when the focus of its work , or of its mandate , is to meet national reporting obligations of supranational or international organisations .
the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stakeholders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its format , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
it is difficult , for example , to assess ex ante the information needs of customers of public services .
instead , it should be possible to use participative techniques such as focus groups with subgroups of end @-@ users to assess in detail the relevance of specific outputs .
• An assessment of the information needs of its stakeholders at national level , through regular dialogue with its direct " clients , " for instance by asking their feedback about their products
the NDO 's potential stakeholders and potential clients are decision @-@ makers , professionals working in the drugs field , the scientifi c community and the general public .
once the stakeholders have been identified , it is necessary for the NDO to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network .
they are the NDO 's key partners and data providers ; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution , and they should gain some benefit for their efforts .
their potential needs cover a broad range of information : external sources of funding for training and training materials , grants , etc . ; national drugs situation in an international context ; international standards and methodological tools in their respective field of activity .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
two additional groups could also be added to the list of stakeholders , although they are usually not the primary target for the NDO 's communication and dissemination strategy .
an NDO contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dissemination of their research results .
making clear and understandable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights : it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the format and content needs identified in the matrix .
information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @-@ too @-@ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
producing a report that goes beyond a simple description of the situation can be done either by being proactive or by using the information available in a more creative manner :
how can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
in the first approach , additional information identified by the NDO may be needed , which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information .
a complementary approach can be to correlate the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
when the NDO produces reports and other outputs , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @-@ defined. ned .
• Be prospective : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and perspectives , or new risks
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
this is what we will describe briefly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
the Commission on narcotic Drugs ( CND ) : is the central policymaking body of the United Nations in drug @-@ related matters .
each of the protocols are standardised with the goal of producing information that is comparable across countries .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comprise the MEM Instrument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
• they are used to build a European picture , to analyse the situation and the evolution of the phenomenon and responses ;
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quantity and quality of the information provided by their respective Member States - this information needs to be accurate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• clarify the process for delivery and identify the end benefi ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national coordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs coordinating body , etc . )
• Be factual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the NDO 's credibility relies on its objectivity , not the political opinions of its staff
indeed , the long @-@ term challenge for the NDO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various " clients " are satisfied. ed .
the next step is to consider whether the NDO 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
a more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its remit ? "
this does not prevent the head of the NDO answering requests for information from journalists , but the internal procedure could imply liaising with the press relations officer of the host institution .
in countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
when the NDO is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confidential note to the national drug coordinating body ( NDC ) - if relevant - or transmits the information through the normal channels .
the main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
get to know key journalists , build a long @-@ term relationship with them , be simple , try to understand their constraints and the way they think , so as to format the information for them .
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
we refer in particular to a study published by Alford in 2001 , in which he presents a few characteristics that can apply to NDOs ( we italicise ) :
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .
• NDO production depends on its cooperation with other national sources of information and of expertise , in most of the cases it cannot work on its own ( co @-@ production )
• the NDO builds its capacity on the basis of diverse resources and partners , at national , local and supranational level ( combined resources )
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clarify the mandate for its establishment ;
• the value of the NDO 's work is not always measurable - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and outputs ;
• the value of the NDO 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
to conclude : try to identify and define the NDO 's perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience / stakeholders , rather than from one of its promoters ( see box below ) .
note : an " elevator pitch " ( or elevator speech ) is an overview of an idea for a product , service , or project .
the name reflects the fact that an elevator pitch can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @-@ 100 words ) .
to support the perceived value of the NDO , we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions / measures : added value of NDO 's products , credibility , and relations with its audiences and stakeholders .
is the NDO promoting itself as the reference organisation that can tailor information according to the needs of its customers ?
is the NDO trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
in fact , in many cases , most of the NDO 's products are the result of partnerships and cooperation , and external expertise may be needed also to validate its analyses and reports .
• ensure that its partners derive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
information map : is an information map drafted and permanently updated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country , and is there any communication policy geared towards the strategic partners ?
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confrontation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
content : do contents of reports and other publications reflect the need for a Multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
does the NDO have a specific and explicit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
does the country cooperate with - and have access to - funding from international or supranational organisations such as the EU , UNODC , WHO , OAS , CARICOM or the Global Fund ?
scientific and professional expertise : are there any drug @-@ related research activities in the country that could provide some information on the drugs situation , or that could benefit from the support and cooperation with the NDO ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evaluations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
a strategic plan aims to make sure that the NDO will consolidate or improve its situation and will maximise its position as regards the three key strategic factors , which could be summarised as follows :
• to improve and to diversify the co @-@ production scheme so as to produce better products which are tailored to the needs of its different client groups ;
• to better combine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @-@ production processes and the quality of publications and other outputs .
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
in the current context of general socio @-@ economic difficulties , one should avoid the temptation of presenting exaggerated objectives and excessive requests for funding .
these will not only be refused by the decision @-@ makers , but will also give the NDO and its promoters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation 's survival .
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the choices to be made .
however , these tools are based on a pre @-@ requisite : do think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have , Don 'T say " I cannot do anything until I get more . "
in this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs observatories , and to which there is usually no single answer .
• within national drug Coordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @-@ governmental organisation .
it is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side .
it is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
if the NDO is established at a too low structural and hierarchical level within an existing institution , this presents the same disadvantages and also gives no visibility to the NDO and its products .
it then becomes extremely difficult for the NDO to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stakeholders at national level .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
• limiting the scope of the NDO 's work to illicit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of supranational and international organisations such the EMCDDA and UNODC ;
it can also provide the opportunity to observe and analyse possible correlations between
• The technical and scientific know @-@ how of the NDO and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• The NDO needs to attract and to keep competent staff , and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries ;
if the NDO is established as a small unit , it often tends to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly @-@ organised national networks .
if the NDO is given an important national mandate as an observatory , this implies that the competences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in chapters 3 to 5 .
if this is the case , special attention must be paid to institutional relations and cooperation , and to communication and public relations .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the NDO will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the NDO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
the objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any misinterpretation of the data , and to validate the publication .
the NDO is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
if the NDO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
national drugs observatories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
• the NDO should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modification in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the NDO 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( factual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the remit of national authorities ;
• the NDO should clarify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available .
when the scope of the work carried out by the NDO within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the NDO .
however there have been situations in which despite these precautions , some political actors have accused the NDO of a lack of objectivity and of being " politically oriented " - if not , providing " false " data .
the time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
taking on board the ideas , concepts and experiences that have been shared with you in this handbook , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like .
there are no institutional models to be copied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .
our priced publications are available from the EU bookshop ( http : / / bookshop.europa.eu ) , where you can place an order with the sales agent of your choice .
looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .
the Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1986 as the western hemisphere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
as well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs , the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply , supply reduction and illicit drug markets .
data collection in the CICAD system takes place within the context of the Inter @-@ American Observatory on Drugs ( OID ) .
one of the agency 's key aims is to render drug information more comparableacross Europe .
although the Centre cannot propose any kindof policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @-@ making throughits analyses , instruments and standards .
the 2007 ESPAD report substance use among students in 35 countries
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet .
it can be accessed through the Europa server ( http : / / europa.eu ) .
the work of the ESPAD project would not have been possible without the generous support of the Swedish Government , the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the Pompidou Group .
summary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bundesländer ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( Flanders ) .
country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
a small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
on average , 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
only four countries give a contrary image regarding the longterm downward trend in recent smoking , displaying higher levels in 2007 than in 1995 .
hence , the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ESPAD countries is one of a decrease , or at least of a stabilized situation .
the total amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequencies .
in nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls . the most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland , where girls report larger quantities than boys .
in a large majority of the countries , beer is the dominant beverage among boys while spirits is the most important beverage among girls in a little more than half of the countries .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
however , there are countries in which many students report heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for drunkenness for the same period .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more evenly distributed pattern , with spirits as the most important type , constituting about one third of the total consumption .
on average 43 % of the ESPAD students reported heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
on average , half of the ESPAD students have been intoxicated at least once during their lifetime , to the point of staggering when walking , having slurred speech or throwing up .
there were gender differences in the frequencies of drunkenness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ESPAD level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the proportion of students reporting heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i.e. by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries in which many students report drunkenness this often include Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days drunkenness .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Latvia .
however , for some of the problems the averages are about the same and for one ( " serious problems with friends " ) it is even slightly higher among girls .
in the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
one @-@ third of the students in the ESPAD countries find cannabis readily available .
countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report nonprescribed use of these drugs ( 8 % versus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
slightly more girls than boys did so ( 8 versus 5 % ) .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007 .
students from Cyprus , the Isle of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lifetime prevalence of inhalants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
the average for lifetime use of inhalants for all ESPAD countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the aggregate level .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lifetime use relatively well across countries .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substances .
the overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
the upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs - predominantly cannabis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
no changes in gender differences are apparent for illicit drugs or the other substances mentioned .
individual country prevalence rates for the keyvariables are compared to the averages for all countries .
the Faroe Islands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the variables .
summary western Europe and countries displaying increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .
we hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey , in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ESPAD project already .
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
summary - the 2007 ESPAD report
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult choices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
the global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence @-@ based approach .
drug use is a complex issue , and it is not one that lends itself to simple conclusions .
a reflection on the information available also reminds us of the need for continued vigilance and of the dangers of complacency .
nonetheless , in Europe as a whole , a tremendous effort has been made to address these sorts of problems ,
• the Members of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA ;
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Horizontal Working Party on Drugs - and the European Commission ;
• the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs ( CAN ) , and the Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS ;
• the Translation Centre for Bodies of the European Union and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities ;
graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
the 2006 statistical bulletin ( http : / / stats06.emcdda.europa.eu ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
the national reports of the Reitox focal points give a detailed description and analysis of the drug problem in each country and are available on the EMCDDA website ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 435 ) .
a continuous programme of evaluation is envisaged for the strategy , with annual progress reviews and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods .
nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
the strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed .
nonetheless , the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ageing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
among those new to treatment , the numbers with a primary opioid problem have been decreasing in most countries .
nonetheless , this is an area where waves of epidemic use have been seen in the past , and therefore complacency must be avoided .
overall range 0.8 % to 11.3 %
elsewhere , while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries , dramatic increases are not being reported .
typical range 0.3 % to 1.5 % ( 15 countries )
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
in Europe , cocaine use is at historically high levels , and studies suggest that it is a common pattern for increases in problems relating to a drug to lag some years behind increases in prevalence .
almost 7 000 acute drug deaths , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2003 data )
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being causally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @-@ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all highprevalence countries .

a common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multifaceted nature of today 's drug problem .
among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , cannabis was the primary reason for referral to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most commonly reported drug after heroin .
while globally methamphetamine problems continue to grow , within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long @-@ established problems .
in 2006 , the EMCDDA published a technical paper on hallucinogenic mushrooms , and this issue is again summarised in our annual reporting .
the availability and use of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed unnoticed .
the emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substances to cause severe health problems is unknown .
there are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @-@ 04 action plan , conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction ( IDT ) .
and in Romania , the national drug strategy 2003 @-@ 04 was evaluated with the participation of all state institutions involved in the field of drugs with the findings forming the basis for the new national drug strategy 2005 @-@ 12 .
on the other hand , it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experiment with drugs and an increase in drugrelated deaths linked to substances other than opioids .
in addition , the Ministry of Health and Consumers " Affairs has approved an action plan 2005 @-@ 08 to mobilise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of progressing and revitalising the national drug strategy .
chapter 1 : policies and laws and justice in the European Union over the period 2005 @-@ 10 .
first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 in June 2005 .
it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol , will present annual progress reviews .
finally , the process will be participative , involving an evaluation steering group whose task will be to define the methodology , output and provisional calendar .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the EMCDDA and Europol , as well as representatives of the Member States .
Consultative hearings for civil society representatives will also be organised .
it has been replaced by a new regulation adopted on 11 February 2004 ( 4 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise definition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
in addition , a regulation laying down rules for implementing these two
these actions in the area of precursors control complete another part of the important activities of the EU in the field of supply reduction .
it aims to ensure that all Member States have in place effective rules governing the confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of criminal offences punishable by deprivation of liberty for more than one year .
directive 91 / 308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States .
Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1277 / 2005 of 27 July 2005 , OJ L 202 , 3.8.2005 , P .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 doses must be charged under Section 172 , which , depending on the aggravating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal liability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
the maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years .
exemption from penalty and postponing the execution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences .
several countries legislated on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period .
difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small , large and very large amounts of narcotic and psychotropic substances , redefining these quantities .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
see " The role of the quantity in the prosecution of drug offences , " an ELDD legal report , and Table 1 in " illicit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
other sentencing statistics showed that the waiving of reports as statutory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convictions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing ( Kivivuori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sentencing , or avoidance of sentencing , give a far more accurate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see EMCDDA , 2002a ) .
data on " reports " ( 11 ) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analysed in this report .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
) , it is more appropriate to compare trends rather than absolute numbers .
routine data are available in the EU only on the last type of crime - drug law offences .
in most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @-@ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .
) and / or the proportion of drug offences that involved
countries where this is the case , cannabis @-@ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @-@ 87 % of all drug law offences .
chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first insight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
a slow integration , strategically or institutionally , of licit drugs into policy and measures against illicit drugs appears to be more and more common .
this is found in the drug policies of some Member States and in EU drug strategies .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to underpin , support and explain to the population at large the rationale underlying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg ) reporting on new projects in this area .
with the recognition and development of the selective prevention approach by most Member States , vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted .
approaches not based on abstinence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initiation among those groups in which incipient drug use is already occurring .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .
the new Member States and candidate countries account for only a small fraction of the clients in substitution treatment in the European region , which can partly be explained by lower levels of opioid use in these countries .
although the overall provision of substitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indications of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( Figure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see Chapter 6 ) .
32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
the reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in the Czech Republic , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , local or regional policies are reported to exist , and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities .
according to the reports by NFPs ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of synergy at the European level . besides drug injectors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
in the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies widen the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
however , in 10 countries ( 37 % ) , infectious disease strategies explicitly mention the prevention of hepatitis C infection among drug
) including France and England , both of which have established full @-@ blown hepatitis C prevention strategies : plan national hepatites virales C et B ( 2002 @-@ 05 )
the common strategic platform on the reduction of healthrelated harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mirrored in many national policies across the EU and has supported a mainstreaming of evidence @-@ based responses in this area .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
units that specialise in treating cannabis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries , and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries .
a similar specialised programme for amphetamine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @-@ 08 action plan calls on Member States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @-@ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interventions combining treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug user rehabilitation .
nonetheless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
under the current economic circumstances , many countries may find it difficult to meet the vocational reintegration needs of older heroin users , even if they are stabilised in drug maintenance treatment .
the service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from Member States converge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and precarious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social reintegration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
) Social reintegration is defined as " any social intervention with the aim of integrating former or current problem drug users into the community . " the three
" pillars " of social reintegration are housing , education and employment ( including vocational training ) .
as facilities are currently available in most countries , and as some countries continue to implement new structures , the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that homeless problem drug users can access these services .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Senegal , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
quantities seized may fluctuate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seizures are very large .
data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates , which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe shows a continuous increase over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , although in 2004 a majority of countries ( but not Spain )
Kingdom for 2004 are not yet available .
it is estimated that about 65 million European adults , that is about 20 % of those aged 15 @-@ 64 , have tried the substance
( 50 ) Taking 1999 as the base year for the value of money in all countries . ( 51 ) See Figure PPP @-@ 2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 52 ) See Table PPP @-@ 5 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 53 ) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
figures here are probably a minimum , as there could be some under @-@ reporting .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 40.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lifetime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
figure 2 : last year prevalence of cannabis use among young adults ( aged 15 @-@ 34 and 15 @-@ 24 )
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @-@ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 % .
the lowest lifetime prevalence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
this could represent an important long @-@ term change in cannabis use patterns that merits further attention .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
other countries are also working on scales to assess intensive forms of cannabis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area .
it has been hypothesised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas , and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s onwards , and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable insights into trends over time .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
this benchmark has often been used in studies and can be derived from the European model questionnaire .
in addition , school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population , which may predict future trends among young adults .
in most countries , since 1995 , there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried cannabis .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
although the number of these requiring interventions is unknown , the number of cannabis @-@ related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure .
a number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for cannabis treatment , and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny .
the available data suggest that cannabis clients in outpatient treatment centres tend to be relatively young : virtually all cannabis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old .
almost no one seeking treatment reports having used cannabis for the first time after the age of
well @-@ implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initiation of young people into the use of substances such as tobacco , alcohol and cannabis .
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @-@ onset users ( pre- to mid @-@ adolescence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( Von Sydow et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) .
an additional consideration in striving to prevent or delay the onset of initiation into cannabis use is the fact that adolescents are more vulnerable to cannabis toxicity .
some clients seek treatment for cannabis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems , and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems , such as conduct disorder among young people . furthermore ,
the profiles of young cannabis users , at least in the early stages of consumption , do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on cannabis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
it is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and cannabis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls , and thus these projects offer training in flirting .
brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it .
there is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse , and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substances .
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interventions may take the form of counselling , " cannabis courses " or even self @-@ help websites .
for example , the German website @-@ based counselling programme , Quit the Shit ( www.drugcom.de ) , is an innovative approach , using telematics , for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
similar websites with self @-@ help components include www.jellinek.nl / zelfhulp / cannabis / frameset.html by Jellinek ( the Netherlands ) and www.knowcannabis.org.uk / by hit ( United Kingdom ) .
the production of amphetamines and ecstasy is difficult to quantify because " it starts with readily available chemicals , in easily concealed laboratories " ( UNODC , 2003a ) .
worldwide , increasing levels of use of methamphetamine are a cause for considerable concern , as the drug is associated with a range of severe health problems .
the best @-@ known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also occasionally found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA , etc . ) .

although the Netherlands remained in 2004 the main source of ecstasy for Europe and the world as a whole , ecstasy laboratories were also uncovered in Belgium , Estonia , Spain and Norway ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; UNODC , 2006 ) .
) This situation should be checked against 2004 data for the United Kingdom when available .
data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004 ; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .

international action against production and trafficking of amphetamines and ecstasy there was a large seizure in Greece of ephedrine from Pakistan .
in Europe 122 litres of safrole was seized in 2004 , mainly in Latvia but also in Lithuania .
traditionally , population surveys have shown that , next to cannabis , amphetamines and ecstasy are the illegal substances most commonly used , albeit the overall prevalence of their use is lower than that of cannabis .

it is estimated that , on average , 1.4 % of young Europeans have used amphetamine in the last year ( see also Figure 4 ) .
although the number of demands for treatment relating to the use of amphetamines and ecstasy is increasing , in general , this form of drug use is rarely the primary reason for
an important exception is that a few countries do report a substantial proportion of treatment requests related to amphetamine
demands for treatment related to ecstasy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ecstasy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
six countries have tightened up their legislation on mushrooms in the last five years ( Denmark , Germany , Estonia , Ireland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .
for example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 2000s , the number of shops selling hallucinogenic mushrooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stalls across the country .
this is a common feature of hallucinogenic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to confine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for recreational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added GHB to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU Member States have been updating their legislation on this substance .
the shortage of prevalence data on GHB and ketamine suggests that use of these substances has stabilised at low levels in most countries .

however , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
the decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate .
the decision broadens the scope of , and replaces , the 1997 joint action ( 3 ) , which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs .

in addition , mCPP is often found in combination with MDMA .
new developments in the promotion of recreational drugs via the Internet and in recreational drug use itself bring with them new challenges in the fields of policy , prevention and risk reduction .
most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Colombia ) or via Central America and the Caribbean . in 2004 , Suriname , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Curaçao , Jamaica , Mexico , Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; INCB , 2006a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
although Spain and the Netherlands still play an important role as distribution points for the reporting countries (

combining several specific psychosocial treatment interventions is currently considered the most promising treatment option for cocaine and other psychostimulant users .
in contrast to heroin addiction , which can be treated with agonists such as methadone or antagonists such as naltrexone , there are currently no medical treatments available for cocaine addiction .
the reason for this would appear to be the mechanism of action through which cocaine exerts its effects on the brain neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin .
one exciting Strand of research is the use of immunotherapy , i.e. the development of a vaccine that would effectively " neutralise " the action of cocaine by preventing the drug from reaching the brain .
it was found that three quarters of the vaccinated cohort of cocaine addicts were able to remain drug free for a period of three months with no untoward sideeffects .
the potential benefit of the cocaine vaccine Ta @-@ CD has raised ethical concerns about the use of a vaccine : who would receive it , who would make the decision and on what criteria , etc .
the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely unexplored , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
as cocaine use can escalate quickly , brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring .
in a number of cities crack cocaine users have been targeted by outreach schemes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with .
for example , one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam ( Henskens , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
a more controversial approach has been adopted in some cities in Europe , where the concept of safe consumption rooms , usually targeting drug injection , has been extended to drug inhalation .
16 3 to EUR 82 per gram in the United Kingdom (

moreover , estimates are often localised geographically , and extrapolation to form national estimates are not necessarily reliable .
despite the general trend towards diversification of the phenomenon , in many countries estimates of problem drug use are exclusively based on problem use of heroin or other opioids as the primary substance .
chapter 6 : Opioid use and drug injection
the evidence that has been collected suggests that the prevalence of problematic opioid use differs widely between countries , and that trends are not consistent across the EU .
geographic variability is , as might be expected , also marked at the local level ; for example , the prevalence in different parts of London varies between 6 and 25 cases per 1 000 .
( 1 ) Countries reporting studies carried out in the last fi ve years ( 1999-

it is therefore important to consider drug injection separately .
despite their importance for public health , few countries provide estimates of injecting drug use at national
the proportion of IDUs among primary heroin users entering drug treatment again suggests marked differences in levels of injecting drug use between countries as well as varying trends over time ( 173 ) .
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
however , in most of the new Member States , at least where data exist , a large proportion of heroin users entering treatment are injectors .
chapter 6 : Opioid use and drug injection a small group of opioid users ( less than 7 % ) are younger
based on the most recent data available , countries can be classified into three groups according to the proportion of drug users seeking treatment who report problem use of heroin , as follows :
11 @-@ 12 in Sofia , Bulgaria , but , in general , demand for treatment for heroin appears to be rare among the young .
Opioid clients are reported to be marginalised in society , with low levels of education , high unemployment rates and often unstable accommodation ; Spain reports that 17 @-@ 18 % of opioid clients are homeless .
countries where a sizeable proportion of opioid clients are using substances other than heroin include Hungary , where the use of home @-@ made opium poppy products is widespread , and Finland , where most opioid clients are misusing
the number of repeat requests has generally not declined , and in most countries the total number of treatment demands for heroin has remained roughly stable .
research has also suggested that levels of criminal activity may be reduced and that sufficient provision of substitution treatment may have an impact on the number of drugrelated deaths .
excluding the Czech Republic and France , where high @-@ dose buprenorphine treatment ( HDBT ) is reported to be the most common option , more than 90 % of treatments in all other countries were with methadone .
chapter 6 : Opioid use and drug injection sharp increase in the United States since then .
those of the USA ( 185
recently , signs of a stabilisation in levels of methadone consumption can be observed in the statistics for Denmark , Spain , Malta , the Netherlands , and possibly Germany .
however , prevalence data come from a variety of sources and , in some cases , may be difficult to compare ; thus , they should be interpreted with caution .
in France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs ( albeit from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
in Latvia , two time series of seroprevalence data among IDUs show a continued increase until 2002 / 03 while a third series suggests a decrease since the peak in 2001 .
in Spain and Italy , national data from case reporting are not available .
a robust body of available evidence shows that interventions can be considered effective and that access to treatment of all types provides protection ( Farrell et al . , 2005 ; WHO , 2005 ) .
since the mid1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors .
in 2003 @-@ 04 , prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
mortality and drugrelated deaths
the measurement of syringe coverage is an important component of understanding the likely effects of syringe distribution in disease prevention and for assessing unmet needs .
however , it is important to take account of the availability of syringes through pharmacies sales ( prices , density of pharmacy network ) as well as drug injectors " behavioural patterns and environmental factors in interpreting these data .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project examined mortality among opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations ( 196 ) .
the study found a very high mortality among opioid users compared with their peers : 6 @-@ 20 times higher among males and 10 @-@ 50 times higher among females .
it was estimated that in six of the locations ( Amsterdam , Barcelona , Dublin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @-@ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @-@ 49 years could be attributed to opioid use , mainly overdoses , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suicides ) .
mortality 9.5 times higher than in the general population , but with a decreasing trend .
in this section , and in the EMCDDA protocol , the term " drugrelated deaths " refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
other terms used to describe such deaths include " overdoses , " " poisonings , " " drug @-@ induced deaths " or " acute drug

the EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
the terminology used varies between countries , and in some cases it is difficult to determine what role methadone played in the death .

2002 was taken as reference as it is the year for which information is available for most countries.Sources : Reitox national reports ( 2005 ) , taken from national mortality registries or special registries ( forensic or police ) .
national trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high @-@ risk behaviours ( e.g. injection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability .
they can also , of course , reflect the success of medical emergency services
deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
figure 13 : long @-@ term trend in acute drugrelated deaths , 1985 @-@ 2004
ecstasy deaths cause considerable concern as they often occur unexpectedly among socially integrated young people .
in Europe as a whole , there were references to 77 deaths ,
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
in Spain , ecstasy was present in 2.5 % of drug poisonings .
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .

such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attributable to the immediate effects of drug taking .
the data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve opioids .

this definition of PDU is a purely behavioural one based on drug consumption patterns and does not explicitly measure problems in any sense .
nonetheless , it is linked to the various concepts of addiction by the understanding that someone behaving in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem user . "
this changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with opioid @-@ related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services .
nonetheless , in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be , in terms of the substances they are using at least , more heterogeneous than has historically been the case .
historically speaking , the EMCDDA monitoring indicator was a child of its time - during the 1980s , and to a large extent the 1990s , heroin use and injecting drug use were seen as key components of the drug problem that required estimation .
while the PDU indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more heterogeneous
in terms of the current implementation of the PDU indicator across the EU , countries have adapted the definition to cover the practicalities of their local situation and the position is therefore heterogeneous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorporated into the monitoring exercise , beyond PDU monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
the way forward in this area requires the formalising of the concept of frequent , intensive use of cannabis and other illicit drugs as a specific target for monitoring .
this pattern of use seems to exist among some chronic users , possibly among marginalised groups , possibly among people with psychiatric conditions .
under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include polydrug use as one of these separately measured components .
a second drug with a functional or pharmacological rationale is not confined to simultaneous use but may also be used consecutively , as a replacement or as a complementary drug .
increased risks through polydrug use
survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period .
an example of the extent of polydrug use data available from population surveys can be seen in a recent technical report of the EMCDDA ( 2005b ) .
figure 15 : use of drugs in the last year by different user groups in the general population aged 15 @-@ 34
Polydrug use could be usefully defined operationally as the frequent use of more than one substance over a minimum specified time period , for example one month .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
given that many of the data sources available are based on behavioural reports of drug consumption , the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis .
the European Union and its Member States give considerable support to international programmes and , in a global context , it is satisfying to observe that , in a number of important areas , the European situation looks relatively positive .
they recognise that the way forward lies in analysing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches .
this is our role , and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain .
but while scientific rigour is essential to our work , we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human beings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ruined by drug problems .
to develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dispassionate about our data , but we must never become dispassionate about the topic .

Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be borne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the EMCDDA is currently collaborating with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to establish a database for the collection of prison health indicators .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems , but studies show that drug use often continues in prison .
these sorts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the composite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can encompass the target concept .
the new regulation of the EMCDDA emphasises the importance of identifying and disseminating good practice .
a key difficulty here is the real world settings in which demand reduction interventions are applied .
the complexities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identifying quality control standards are addressed in this report .
cannabis : popularity may have peaked - as recognition of public health issues grows
there are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and configuration of response .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm @-@ reduction activities .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most commonly consumed illicit drug by young and very young people .
drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
although some Member States have introduced schemes to divert offenders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
and , although the data are still relatively weak , there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreasing in some countries .
over 7 500 acute drug deaths , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2004 data )
Europe remains the main global market for cannabis resin , most of which is produced in North Africa . herbal cannabis is also available in Europe ,
Coordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new intergovernmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine interdiction .
each year , around 400 cocaine @-@ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardiovascular deaths in which cocaine has been an aggravating factor may go largely undetected .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher proportion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tripled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
during the 1990s , the experience , or potential threat , of a widespread HIV epidemic among drug injectors was a catalyst for the development of services for this group .
increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
as a result , especially in areas where prevalence has been high , the burden of infection resulting from injecting drug use is likely to be decreasing .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
( HCV ) - including a significant proportion who are no longer using drugs .
across Europe , HCV rates are high among injecting populations , and studies show that young injectors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @-@ using careers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
this raises the question for Europe : what effect will this increase have on the drug problem ?
in the north and north @-@ east of the country , not only have increasing wage rates and falling opium prices deterred poppy planting , but also some high @-@ value vegetables actually generate greater returns than poppies .
in these areas , crop diversification has been supported by counter @-@ narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement - leading to a general perception that opium prohibition measures will be enforced .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems arising from lack of security .
reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
overdose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoidable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin @-@ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
particularly of concern is the fact that in a few countries the proportion of younger people among those dying has been growing .
reducing drug @-@ related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the faltering in the downward trend needs to be identified .
in Austria , a growing proportion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of opioids diverted from legitimate uses .
this approach , which has been in place in other Member States ( e.g. Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benefited from the experience of earlier ones .
estimating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug @-@ related public expenditure .
the objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries .
the " balanced " approach , which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction , is also very widespread .
a noticeable trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two complementary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the policy of combining a drug strategy with action plans facilitates more detailed definitions of objectives , actions , responsibilities and deadlines . some countries , for example
the new regulation clarifies the countries to which the EMCDDA can transfer its know @-@ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
moves towards the integration of licit and illicit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years ( e.g. Germany ,
in two Member States ( Belgium , Slovenia ) , the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects .
in most other countries , and at EU level , the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is systematically monitored .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interventions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interventions and the importance given
having in the EU a diversity of national drug strategies with common objectives can be viewed as a strength because it allows comparative analysis of different types of approach .
almost all European countries mention the objective of evaluating their national drug strategy .
there is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
drug policy indexes countries ( e.g. Finland , Portugal ) , Coordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national Coordination bodies .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
the conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow @-@ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes .
nevertheless , some general features can be described .
at the regional or local level , drug Coordination agencies and / or drug coordinators exist in most countries .
six countries provided detailed information of expenditure associated with tackling drugs ( Table 1 ) .
this figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug @-@ related public expenditure , given the high level of under @-@ reporting . the six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
the analysis of a State 's public expenditure provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and efficiently. ciently .
indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use , and typically consist of lost productivity due to drug @-@ related morbidity and mortality .
drug @-@ related social costs are the total of all the costs to society , direct and indirect , caused by drug use .
second , it identifies the different components of cost and thesize of the contribution of each sector in society .
such informationcan help to determine funding prioritiesby highlighting areas where inefficiencies may exist and savings can be made .

in June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union ( 6 ) , as laid down in the drugs action plan .
the aim of the Green Paper is to explore how best to organise a continuous dialogue with civil society organisations active in the drugs field .
in Ireland , substantive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 , which sets out new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour and proposals to strengthen imposition of the 10 @-@ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EUR 13 000 or more .
procedures regarding the drug testing of drivers are further described in the 2007 selected issue on drugs and driving .

there are also provisions for the temporary protection of witnesses in drugs cases and , in some circumstances , for protecting the identity of witnesses , as well as special rules for the questioning of such witnesses and use of undercover officers .
in Norway , it is no longer the case that drug testing in the workplace can be carried out provided an employee or job applicant gives consent .

taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .
of the EMCDDA 's five key indicators , publications on infectious diseases are the most numerous , followed by publications on the prevalence of drug use among young people .
Psychoactive substances can impair a person 's ability to drive a car to the extent that the risk of accidents and injuries is increased .

Greece , Cyprus , Lithuania and Italy monitor school @-@ based prevention , while in Greece , Poland , Sweden and Finland , community @-@ based prevention services are under study , and France has set up a centralised system to monitor drug prevention .
some countries ( the Czech Republic , the autonomous region of Galicia in Spain , Hungary and Norway ) are already focusing on the evidence base when funding for interventions is applied for , and are considering introducing accreditation systems .
those that are evaluated are usually assessed in terms of the " scope and the acceptance of the intervention " rather than " the extent to which the objectives have been achieved " ( Greek national report ) .
treatment and harm @-@ reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug addicts , and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evaluated through outcome studies .
in the sections below , the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed , based on the results of this study and others .
the effects of individual prevention strategies cannot , in general , be measured by changes in population @-@ level prevalences of drug use .
however , every prevention strategy can be compared against the accumulated body of evidence , to determine whether or not it is an evidence @-@ based intervention .
member States are increasingly monitoring prevention interventions and , as a result , are delivering data on the
criteria commonly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence @-@ based practice are efficacy and effectiveness ( Brown et al . , 2000 ; Flay et al . , 2005 ) .
it remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and weigh the different sources of evidence in the decision @-@ making process .
this will be even more difficult in the case of interventions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective .
frequently , interventions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under routine conditions .

for example , in the Netherlands a campaign put across the message " You are not mad if you are not smoking cannabis , because 80 % of all young people

16 ) , despite evidence which suggests that other visits ) ( methods may be more effective .
such schemes principally take the form of information events and , to a lesser extent , the provision of alternative leisure @-@ time pursuits .
member States are increasingly devoting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
once target communities have been identified ( e.g. France recognises " sensitive urban zones " or , in the case of schools , " educational priority zones " ) , supplementary funds can be directed towards these underprivileged groups .
in Ireland , Cyprus and the United Kingdom , selective prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas , and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy .
in many Member States ( Bulgaria , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Austria , Romania ) the content of prevention

access to outpatient treatment is easier and less selective in most countries , it is appropriate to extrapolate from this group of clients to drug users as a whole .
although selective prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in peer @-@ to @-@ peer programmes ( Cho et al . , 2005 ; Dishion and Dodge , 2005 ) , because negative " Contagion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
these unintended effects , which are caused by the intervention itself , can lead to increased substance use or risk behaviour .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
about 80 % of outpatient treatment clients are male , with a mean age of around 30 years ( 28 years among those new to treatment ) , and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age .
residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @-@ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the coexistence of serious somatic and psychological co @-@ morbidity .
the philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
legal frameworks of substitution treatment pharmacological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific user groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage .
the substances that can be used for substitution treatment are normally designated by law .
in some countries , sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discretion of each individual treatment centre .
after political endorsement as a response to heroin use in the second half of the 1980s , substitution treatment has gone on to become the predominant option for the treatment of opioid dependence in most countries ( Figure 2 ) .

extensive country @-@ by @-@ country inventories are included in this background document ( 23 ) .
for example , Bulgaria and Romania are the only
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe countries that mention specific social reintegration projects for street children .
an important feature of the studies is that they investigate treatment outcomes in existing services under day @-@ to @-@ day clinical circumstances .
in Italy , the Vedette study ( 1998 @-@ 2001 ) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country .
there were some positive findings , such as increased rates of abstinence from illicit drug use , a reduction in the frequency of drug use , a reduction in crime and improved health .
to avoid " locking " clients into longer @-@ term service dependence , innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explored .
an update of the NTORS study will be provided by the Drug Treatment outcomes Research Study ( DTORS ) being carried out at the University of Manchester .
it aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment pathways produce the best outcomes for particular subgroups of drug users .
however , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @-@ esteem , status and a regular rhythm of life .
new ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , mentoring schemes and providing incentives such as Subsidising trainees " wages or giving business start @-@ up loans .
in several countries , drug treatment facilities have started their own socio @-@ economic enterprises , gainfully employing their clients .
other initiatives focus on improving the employment situation through better matching of profiles , expectations and skills with the realities of work life .
the reintegration of marginalised , ageing heroin users with high levels of somatic and mental illness poses a particular challenge .
in some countries ( e.g. Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow @-@ on from successfully completed abstinence @-@ based drug dependence treatment , and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
interpreting seizures and other market data
cannabis is the world 's most commonly used illicit drug and a substance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 1960s when its use became virtually synonymous with a growing youth counterculture .
one important element in this picture is the different cannabis products now available on the European market . historically , three main forms of cannabis have been common in Europe : cannabis resin ; herbal cannabis ; and , far less frequently , cannabis oil .
for many , the smoking of cannabis resin with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug , though , elsewhere in the world , this pattern of use is relatively uncommon .
in recent years , this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing availability of cannabis produced within Europe ; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high potency .
this kind of cannabis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complicates the assessment of the public health impact of changing patterns of cannabis consumption .
the reader should note that there are difficulties in compiling information of this sort and , in many parts of the world , information systems are poorly developed .
because cannabis can be grown in a range of different environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production .
this is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and , in some countries , penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review .
this can be seen in the findings of the recent Eurobarometer survey ( 2006 ) , which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of cannabis should be legalised throughout Europe .
young people increased in virtually all countries . however , some of the more recent data suggest that the upward trend is levelling off , albeit at historically high levels .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available , which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006 .
three measures of drug use over time are commonly used for reporting survey data . lifetime use or prevalence is the broadest .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
if attention is restricted to young people in the 15- to 24 @-@ year age range , prevalence estimates for lifetime use range between 3 % and 44 % ( with most countries reporting figures in the range 20 @-@ 40 % ) .
moving the point of reference from lifetime to last year , the levels of reported cannabis use fall but still remain considerable .
estimates suggest that more than 23 million European adults have used cannabis in the last year , producing an average figure of about 7 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
it is estimated that 13.4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month , on average about 4 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
total numbers were computed by multiplying prevalence among the population concerned in each country and , in countries for which no information was available , imputing the average prevalence .
figures here are probably a minimum , as there could be some under @-@ reporting . )
there are additional estimations for Scotland , Northern Ireland and a combined estimation for the United Kingdom is available ( presented in the 2007 statistical bulletin ) . )
the EMCDDA is currently working closely with a number of Member States on the development of a better methodological approach to this issue .
it is planned that this estimation can be updated in the near future .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
in this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
developing psychometric scales to identify intensive , dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Reitox national report ) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
and , the approach of restricting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any precision .
in fact , nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview .
however , this still provides only a blunt tool for identifying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of cannabis .
during the early 1990s , the United Kingdom stood out as a high @-@ prevalence country , reporting on most measures the highest prevalence figures in Europe .
however , last year prevalence levels among young adults ( 16 @-@ 34 ) stabilised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.0 % to 16.3 % ) .
levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
in the Czech Republic , a country with high prevalence rates , trends are difficult to assess within the data available - although the information for young adults suggests that prevalence levels may have fallen slightly .
tracking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
42 cannabis use is usually in outpatient settings (
however , there are interesting variations between countries , with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the proportion of
see Tables TDI @-@ 22 and TDI @-@ 23 ( part i ) and ( part IV ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
see Figure TDI @-@ 2 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
missing data were interpolated for each country by maintaining the average EU trend in the available data for each year .
overall , cannabis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasionally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 27 % ) and those using it daily ( 39 % ) .
the increase in the demand for cannabis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation .
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
see Tables TDI @-@ 13 , TDI @-@ 14 and TDI @-@ 21 ( part i ) and ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
in some of the programmes , the orientation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems .
for cannabis users referred from court services , treatment interventions are not the only kind of response noted .
one European initiative in this area is the Incant project , where Belgium , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland have cooperated on exploring the value of multidimensional family therapy ( MDFT ) with cannabis users .
concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients

the use of these substances among the general population is typically low , but prevalence rates among younger age groups are significantly higher , and in some social settings or cultural groups the use of these drugs may be particularly high .
amphetamine seized in Europe is reported to come mainly from Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland , and to a lesser extent from Estonia and Lithuania .
in 2005 , however , a majority of reporting countries recorded a downward trend in the number of amphetamine seizures made . this picture

a question arising from the data in some countries ( Spain , Denmark , the United Kingdom ) is whether cocaine is replacing amphetamines and ecstasy as the stimulant drug of choice ( 75 ) .
in recent school surveys , increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .

the high prevalence of drug use in some recreational settings , such as clubs , bars and dance events means that these locations have been identified as appropriate targets for drug demand reduction initiatives .
in all countries , except Greece and Sweden , the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary use of amphetamines and ecstasy is greater than the proportion of
one approach has been to make information material that may have prevention and , sometimes , harm @-@ reduction messages available in recreational settings .
clients entering treatment for use of stimulants other than cocaine are on average around 27 years old ( 26 if they enter treatment for the first time ) and used the drug for the first time at an average age of 19 ( 83 ) .
in addition , to responses that aim at informing and persuading individuals not to use drugs , an increasing number of Member States are also developing approaches to better regulate recreational environments .
some of these approaches , including running explicitly drug @-@ free events , have attempted to alter the beliefs held by some that drug use facilitates their leisure activities .
for example , safe clubbing guidelines , such as those developed in the United Kingdom ( 86 ) , are now being produced in a number of countries .

in recognition of the growing importance of this subject , patterns of cocaine use are explored in detail in the 2007 selected issue on cocaine .
the mean prices of cocaine , corrected for inflation , showed an overall downward trend over the period 2000 @-@ 05 in most of the 19 countries reporting sufficient data .
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversifying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
see Table GPS @-@ 8 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
use of cocaine is not confined to certain social groups , but use of the drug by socially integrated young adults in recreational settings can reach higher levels than those reported in general population surveys .
Studies targeting dance music settings in several European countries revealed lifetime prevalence of cocaine use ranging from 10 % to
the reported increase in last year cocaine prevalence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15 @-@ 24 age group , rather than across 15 @-@ 34 year olds as a whole .

it is interesting to note that the European Foundation of Drug Helplines reports an increase in the number of calls related to cocaine during 2005 and 2006 ( 114 ) .
in contrast to opioid treatment , pharmacological options for cocaine treatment are limited , although prescribing can be helpful in providing relief for related symptoms .
although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
cocaine and crack cocaine : a growing public health issue - EMCDDA 2007 selected issue given to the health consequences of cocaine , which are often not well recognised in existing reporting systems .
this selected issue shows that , in some European countries , there has been a marked increase in the use of cocaine , in treatment demands for cocaine and in seizures of the drug .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
in the few countries where problematic use of amphetamines is reported , well @-@ documented estimates are available .
estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is , except in few high @-@ prevalence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) See Figure PDU @-@ 4 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
the proportion of injectors among all primary heroin users entering drug treatment ( 2001 @-@ 05 ) shows marked differences in levels of injecting between countries .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
it should be noted that trends in injecting in non @-@ heroin users may be different .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
many countries have taken these concerns seriously , and Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom all report that reviews are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided .
one reason for interest in the use of buprenorphine is that it is arguably a more suitable pharmaceutical option than methadone for use in community practice .
Buprenorphine is marketed in the form of sublingual tablets , and although it is not considered a particularly attractive substance to inject , reports exist that tablets have been dissolved and injected .
the potential for misuse of buprenorphine is supported by reports from some countries of the diversion of the drug onto the illicit market .
to deter illicit use of buprenorphine , a new formulation of the drug , in combination with naloxone , has been developed .
the efficacy of heroin as a substitution agent has also been explored in experimental research in both Spain ( March et al . , 2006 ) and Germany ( Naber and Haasen , 2006 ) .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 123 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
and in Hungary , where the use of home @-@ made opium poppy products has a long history , around 4 % of treatment requests are related to opium .
in the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low @-@ threshold agencies , a significant proportion of drug clients seek treatment for primary opioid use ( 127 ) .
in the EU Member States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
however , the data does suggest the need to review the availability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs .
based on the most recent data available , opioid users make up 40 @-@ 70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries , less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries ( 130
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreasing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom ( 131 ) .
the levels of clients " repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in opioid use incidence and prevalence , as well as treatment service organisation and type .
the absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of opioid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem opioid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be homeless .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .
the symbol indicates a point estimate ; a bar indicates an uncertainty interval arising from the estimation procedures ; the number of opioid users is estimated by various methods : Tm = treatment multiplier ; PM = police multiplier ; MI = multivariate indicator .
furthermore , perceived safety of BZP is fostered by the fact that the products are often sold by designated retailers or in specialised shops rather than on the street .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by
this group of synthetic substances is derived from the parent compound piperazine and includes BZP ( 1 @-@ benzylpiperazine ) and mCPP ( 1- ( 3 @-@ chlorophenyl ) piperazine ) .

it might be assumed that the addition of mCPP is intended to potentiate or ameliorate the effects of MDMA .
cases of sexual assault by means of covertly adding a drug to a drink in order to incapacitate a victim have been increasingly reported in the media and medical literature since the 1980s .
a lack of information makes trends in GHB use difficult to assess , although the available evidence suggests that use of GHB remains limited to some small subpopulation groups .
if young people do go online seeking drug information , a real question arises as to the extent to which the information they access will be unbiased and accurate .
the main health risk associated with the use of GHB appears to be the high risk of loss of consciousness , especially when the drug is combined with alcohol or other sedative drugs .
in Amsterdam , the reported number of non @-@ fatal emergencies due to the use of GHB was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emergencies attributed to use of
a caveat to this analysis is that in several high @-@ prevalence countries , recent case reporting data is not available ( Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria ) .
higher figures were reported by Ireland and Luxembourg , with 16 and 15 new cases per million respectively .
in Latvia , Lithuania and probably also in Estonia , rates of reported new IDU @-@ related infections have strongly declined since the epidemic peaks in 2001 @-@ 02 , although they are still high in comparison with most other countries .
in interpreting this data , a number of considerations should be borne in mind : infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services ; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs ( those injecting less than two years ) and young IDUs ( those under age 25 ) .
estimates for Spain and Sweden include 2006 data ; data for Ireland and Latvia are from 2003 ; data for Slovakia are from 2003 / 04 .
in mind that the size of these subsamples is , in general , small and that HIV seroprevalence data on young and new IDUs is not available from some countries .
most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence , suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection .
among young IDUs ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high prevalence ( over 40 % in at least one sample ) was found in seven countries and among new IDUs , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
) , although specific data for IDUs are not available . AIDS incidence data remains important as it indicates the level of symptomatic disease and the introduction and availability of HAART .
in the case of hepatitis B , the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases appears generally to have declined , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes . no general trend is visible for the proportion of IDUs among notified cases of hepatitis
data for the two most recent years are estimates adjusted for reporting delays therefore subject to changes over time ( source EuroHIV ) . )
for those who are drug @-@ dependent , treatment programmes in prison can provide an opportunity that may benefit not only the individual 's health , but may also reduce the likelihood of future offending .
the EMCDDA is involved in the joint development of the database together with WHO Europe and the European Network on Drugs and infections Prevention in Prison ( Endipp ) ( 1 ) .
drug treatment and harm @-@ reduction services also need to develop responses to the risks posed by the sexual behaviour of their clients .
in general , syringe provision outlets are located in specialised drugs agencies , and in all but three countries this type of provision is complemented by mobile services that can reach out to groups of drug injectors in marginalised neighbourhoods .
Syringe vending machines complement the available NSP services in 10 countries ( 152 ) , but data on turnover are scarce and research about the effectiveness of this type of provision is lacking .
between 2003 and 2005 , increases in the total number of syringes exchanged or distributed through specialised NSPs were reported by several countries ( Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia ,
the EMCDDA definition of drug @-@ related deaths refers to those that are caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs .
" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
the number of drug @-@ related deaths in a community will depend on the number of people using drugs associated with overdose ( particularly opioids ) .
although the comparability of European data has improved in recent years , differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct comparisons should be made with caution .
Opioids are present in most cases of acute drug @-@ related deaths due to illegal substances reported in the EU , accounting for 46 % to 100 % ( Figure 12 ) , mainly heroin or its metabolites .
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
see Tables DRD @-@ 2 ( part i ) , DRD @-@ 3 and DRD @-@ 4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
as most cases reported to the EMCDDA are opioid overdoses , general characteristics of acute drug @-@ related deaths are used for description of opioid cases . )

( 2 ) Office of National Statistics definition.NB : in some countries , the " National definitions " of drug @-@ related death include a limited number of cases of deaths indirectly related to drug use .
mean age at overdose death is lowest in Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , and Romania and highest in Poland , Finland and the United Kingdom .
in the other Member States , the trend is less clear , and the small numbers of cases makes it difficult to interpret the figures ( 164 ) .
overdose deaths due to cocaine are more difficult to identify than those caused by opioids , and are often considered to be the result of a combination of causes , rather than from cocaine toxicity itself ( 166 ) .
deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , which is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .

figure 13 : overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
there is a marked discrepancy in trends in drug @-@ related deaths between the EU @-@ 15 Member States and those who have joined since 2004 .
increases in the proportion of drug @-@ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
the European project Isadora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @-@ year research period ( 1 ) .
easier accessibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including substitution treatment , improve rates of retention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @-@ related deaths and mortality .
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
research suggests that concurrent use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sedative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal opioid overdose and , therefore , polydrug use is an important issue for services to address .
this approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date , but may have potential .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , whereby drug users may consume their drugs in a designated space where
drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the INCB in their recent annual reports , but are viewed by some EU Member States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use .

one has only to consider the worrying developments resulting from the transiting of cocaine through West Africa to be reminded of the collateral damage that this problem can cause .
we are proud to present this , the thirteenth , annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
this report is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our partners in the Reitox network of national focal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
for most forms of drug use , our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases , and in some areas the trends appear to be downward .
it is gratifying to note that , by international standards , Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed .
nonetheless , we are aware of the limitations of our current information resources , and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and relevance of the data available .
an acceptance that our activities can , and do , make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support .
the EMCDDA would like to thank the following for their help in producing this report :
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Horizontal Working Party on Drugs - and the European Commission ;
• the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities .
graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
reports of the prevalence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged 15 @-@ 64 years .
in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " refers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " refers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the proportion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denominator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question .
figures for 2005 may substitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data ; for the analysis of other trends , missing data may be interpolated .
the 2008 statistical bulletin ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / stats08 ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for reflection and policy formation the user is often difficult , and Member States vary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly cannabis users , the likelihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug use prevention : evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value .
the challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
it is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differentiated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differentiated needs of their clients .
the portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .
examples of evaluated practices across Europe are also provided .
recent data from school and adult population surveys suggest that overall cannabis use has stabilised or is declining in some countries .
the number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years , and many countries now have a significant proportion of their problem opioid users in long @-@ term substitution treatment .
this trend has led to a widening of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome , as opposed to treatment uptake , as a primary policy concern .
commentary : the drug situation in Europe
last year use : about 23 million European adults or one @-@ third of lifetime users now visible , and is most evident in the 16 @-@ 24 age group .
country variation in last year use : overall range 0.8 % to 11.2 %
last month use : around 2 million
last year use : over 2.6 million or one @-@ third of lifetime users Last month use : more than 1 million
country variation in last year use : overall range 0.2 % to 3.5 %
last year use : around 2 million or one @-@ fifth of lifetime users Last month use : less than 1 million
in 2005 @-@ 06 , druginduced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths of Europeans 15 @-@ 39 years old , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them
the extent and relative market share of domestically produced herbal cannabis remains unknown , and in response to this the EMCDDA is carrying out a study on mapping the cannabis market in Europe .
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis .
however , patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Methamphetamine use remains rare outside the CzechRepublic and Slovakia , although the availability or use of the drug is sporadically reported by other countries .
this would imply that , as well as targeting individual substances , interventions need to consider stimulant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems .
typically , the production of one kilogram of amphetamine or MDMA results in around 15 @-@ 20 kilograms of waste material , including toxic and inflammable chemicals which constitute an environmental hazard .
commentary : the drug situation in Europe the relative proportion of opioid users - but not their actual numbers - had been falling , but this trend now appears to have levelled out .
in Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , for example , there are indications of a growing problem caused by the availability of 3 @-@ methylfentanyl that is illicitly manufactured outside the EU .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed , the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development .
consequently , successful interventions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented .
introduction themselves to achieving measurable results in reducing the supply and demand for illicit drugs by 2008 .
in this year , both the United Nations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of , and harms caused by , illicit drugs .
this assessment is to be followed by a one @-@ year reflection period , during which discussions will first be held among intergovernmental expert working groups and then in intersessional meetings .
this " drug summit " set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents ( 2
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with input from the EU Member States , Europol and the EMCDDA .
all of these documents cover a time span of three to four years and , with the exception of the Turkish action plan , they have been preceded by previous plans or programmes .
Italy 's first drug action plan has a time frame of one year , and is to be followed by a four @-@ year action plan ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) , which will be synchronised with the new EU action plan on drugs .
it met for the first time in December 2007 and again in May 2008 to discuss the evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the new action plan .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in Chapter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
a further two countries provided rough estimates of overall public expenditure related to the drug problem ( Spain , Malta ) , though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent .
these figures must , however , still be taken as indicative because of the limited data on which they are based .
total general government expenditure in the year . in Ireland , government departments and State agencies are invited to report their annual drugrelated expenditure to the coordinating Department of Community , Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs .
these expenditures are not necessarily labelled as drugrelated in official accountancy documents .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking offence .
most of the expenditures identified were originally " labelled " as drug related , and were generally traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
asks the question : do the changes in legal definitions and responses to drug users indicate a new , wider trend in how countries view users of drugs ?
however , during this period , not all countries have been reducing penalties : France and Poland decided not to change their laws after consultations ; and Denmark raised the " normal " penalties from cautions to fines ( which were then increased ) .
however , Member States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
further descriptions of the various treatment alternatives to punishment and the extent of their use can be found in the
ELDD 's " Topic overview " and " Legal reports " sections ( 8
crimes committed that are , in some way , linked to drugs (
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

based on reports from 25 Member States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an overview of the organisation of drugrelated research in European countries .
in 15 of the 27 reporting countries , structures to coordinate drugrelated research exist at national level .
constraints to drugrelated research were reported by several countries .
among the problems identified were : organisational aspects , such as a lack of Coordination and scattered resources ( Germany , France , Austria ) ; the
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points .
the European Commission has commissioned an in @-@ depth comparative analysis of research in to illicit drugs in the European Union .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe lack of qualified research staff ( Latvia , Hungary ) ; and methodological aspects ( data protection issues , problems in reaching hidden populations , lack of continuity in research projects ) .
dissemination abstracts and welcome international contributions .
in addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
in 2006 , research findings in the drugs field were published in more than 100 such European journals .
a total of 25 European peer @-@ reviewed journals specialising in the drugs field and publishing in 11 languages other than English were identified .
the majority of these national journals publish English
the European Commission , Eurostat , Europol and the EMCDDA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
the changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more rational and evidencebased approach , but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear .
these include standardised programmes , peer approaches or interventions specifically for boys ; all of which aim
extensive provision : the intervention is provided in a majority of locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
full provision : the intervention is available in almost all locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
since 2004 , an increasing number of drug policies have indicated them as primary targets for prevention interventions , but the reported level of intervention provision has not increased during this period .
this selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( http : / / emcdda.europa.eu / publications / selected @-@ issues ) .
drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe .
several research studies have shown that interventions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environments and reduce social exclusion , also have a moderating effect on later substance use ( Toumbourou et al . , 2007 ) .
recent literature reviews ( 19 ) , however , show that certain
children with behavioural disorders , such as coexisting attention deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder and conduct disorder , are at high risk of developing substance use problems .
the EMCDDA " Best practice " portal content of prevention projects .
in the Czech Republic , for instance , certification of preventive activities is a condition for receiving subsidies from the State budget .
the first module of the portal focuses on universal prevention , in particular on evidence of efficacy which is based on several reviews published since 2000 .
the portal provides information on the efficacy of various interventions , but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making choices between different interventions requires caution .
the new edition of the EDDRA databank , available on the portal , features examples of evaluated interventions in different countries and settings , and may provide additional guidance .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects ( Werch and Owen , 2002 ) .
outpatient settings , including general practice , account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe , mainly because substitution treatment is usually delivered in these settings .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes ( NSPs ) , which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases .
in Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Baltic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings . "
after methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .
finally , some Member States have recently looked at the consequences of the introduction of harmreduction interventions .
the prevention and reduction of drugrelated harm is a public health objective in all Member States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan ( European Commission , 2007a ) .
of users , particularly women , heroin and crack users , those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co @-@ morbid psychiatric problems .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social reintegration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interventions to drug users .
from the data available , it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illicit drug use pass through EU prisons every year .
the responsibility for healthcare in prison lies , in most countries , with the Ministry of Justice .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
in Belgium , a 2006 directive from the Ministry for Justice states that inmates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison .
however , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
the aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed , at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody .
these estimates have some important limitations linked , for instance , with variations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas , like cannabis .
in the early and mid @-@ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence , whereas the European norm was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @-@ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis @-@ related problems .
information on drug precursors is obtained from the INCB , which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .
( Reitox national reports ) . herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Nigeria , Angola ) , south @-@ east Asia ( Thailand ) , south @-@ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americas ( Colombia , Jamaica ) ( CND , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
Europe , where in addition to home production ( 35
the area under cannabis resin production declined from 134 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
76 400 hectares producing 1 066 tonnes in 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Morocco , 2007 ) .
in the Netherlands , cannabis cultivation is widespread in some parts of the country , with an estimated total of 6 000 cultivation sites dismantled in 2005 and 2006 .
in some countries , it seems that a majority of users are now consuming locally produced herbal cannabis .
cannabis that is produced locally also has the advantage for the producer that it does not need to be transported across national borders .
seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @-@ 03 , the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003 @-@ 04 , but thereafter have been declining .
in the recovery of about 2.3 million cannabis plants ( and 22 tonnes of cannabis plants ( 64 % accounted by Spain ) .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
in 2006 , the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3 % to 18.4 % , while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15- to 64 @-@ year- olds ( see Table 2 for a summary of the data ) .
generally being reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
many countries report comparatively high prevalence levels of last year and last month use of cannabis .
estimates of last month prevalence will include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way ( see below ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) have ever used cannabis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
group have used cannabis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
for example , the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 males for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
as with lifetime experience , there is a wide variation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
after tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
ever in lifetime use of cannabis by 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experimenting with this substance often occurs at or around this age .
data from the 2005 / 06 HBSC survey of 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed large variation in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use across 27 countries .
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
Spain ( 8.7 % ) Italy ( 5.8 % ) UnitedKingdom France , CzechRepublic ( 4.8 % )
chapter 3 : cannabis representing approximately 2 @-@ 2.5 % of all Europeans in
HBSC data show that frequent cannabis use remains rare among 15 @-@ year @-@ old schoolchildren .
this issue is highlighted in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups .
the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used cannabis are more likely to have used other substances .
although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @-@ term cannabis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them judged to be dependent at the time of the study .
a follow @-@ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @-@ term users , measures of cannabis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) .
only Sweden and Norway report a series of surveys of young people or conscripts dating back to the 1970s .
the EMCDDA is developing , in collaboration with several countries , methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long @-@ term forms of cannabis use , including dependence .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe school students .
a comparison of HBSC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15 @-@ year @-@ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
other recent national school surveys conducted in Spain , Portugal , Slovakia , Sweden and the UnitedKingdom also report stable or decreasing trends .
as cannabis availability in Europe as a whole does not seem to have changed and prices seem to be decreasing in most countries providing information , an explanation for the current stabilisation or decrease has to be found elsewhere .
England and Wales . see Figure GPS @-@ 4 in the 2008 statistical bulletin for further information .
Reitox national reports ( 2007 ) , taken from population surveys , reports or scientific articles .
decreases in experimental or occasional use of cannabis are not necessarily directly related to trends in the regular use of the drug .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
client profiles in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those variations may be explained by differences in prevalence of intensive cannabis use , drug treatment organisation or referral practices .
overall , primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequency of use : those who use it occasionally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
in addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collaborating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @-@ based treatment for problematic cannabis use ( Incant ) ( 58 ) .
these Internetbased services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and cannabis .

isolated studies found that higher cigarette taxes appear to decrease the intensity of marijuana use and may have a modest negative effect on the probability of use among males ( Farrelly et al . , 2001 ) .
the best @-@ known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also sometimes found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA ) .
its popularity has historically been linked with the dance @-@ music scene and , in general , synthetic drug use at high prevalence is associated with particular cultural sub @-@ groups or social settings .
on the illicit drugs market , the main representatives of the amphetamines group are amphetamine and methamphetamine ( and their salts ) - two closely related synthetic substances , members of the phenethylamine family .
given the physical forms in which they are available , amphetamine and methamphetamine may be ingested , snorted , inhaled and , less commonly , injected .
Methamphetamine major producer and consumer of this drug ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2008 ) .
international action against the manufacture and diversion of synthetic drug precursors
project Prism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs , through a system of preexport notifications for licit trade and the reporting of shipments stopped and seizures made when suspicious transactions occur .
over the past five years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 19 countries where sufficient data are available to allow an analysis .
seizures of safrole , which may replace 3,4 @-@ MDP @-@ 2 @-@ P in the synthesis of MDMA , remained marginal in 2006 , with 62 litres seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seizure of safrole ( 7 litres ) .
over the period 2001 @-@ 06 , with the exception of the Czech Republic , Spain and Romania , the retail price of amphetamine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 11 to SZR @-@ 18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
note that where data for 2006 are absent , the corresponding data for 2005 are used to estimate European totals .
Norway accounts for most seizures and amounts recovered , followed by Sweden , the CzechRepublic and Slovakia .
overall , the number of ecstasy seizures has decreased over the period 2001 @-@ 06 , and the quantity seized has also declined , after a peak year in 2002 ( 64 ) .
in contrast , overall , consumption levels of synthetic hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period .
higher prevalence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinct consumption patterns . in a limited number of
in some countries , cocaine appears to be the dominant stimulant drug , while in others , amphetamine or methamphetamine appear more commonly used . the picture that emerges from combining
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
use of the drug in the last year is much lower , with a European average of 0.6 % ( range 0.0 @-@ 1.3 % ) .
last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7 % and 1.9 % .
for example , recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration , such as injection and smoking .
the EMCDDA indicator on problem drug use ( PDU ) can be used in a restricted sense for amphetamines , where it defines as such the injecting or long duration / regular use of the substance .
only one Member State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users ( 4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15 @-@ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
amphetamine users entering treatment are , on average , around 29 year sold and male .
in most countries , though not in Sweden and Finland , the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary amphetamine use is greater than the proportion of all clients receiving treatment for this drug .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
it is estimated that about 9.5 million European adults have tried ecstasy ( 3 % on average ) and that about 3 million ( 0.8 % ) have used it in the last year ( see Table 4 for a summary of the data ) .
among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) , lifetime prevalence estimates area little higher ( 0.3 % to 7.1 % ) , although lower prevalence levels are reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
amphetamine use ( last 12 months ) among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 ) in the UnitedKingdom declined substantially between 1996 ( 6.5 % ) and 2002 ( 3.1 % ) , with the figures remaining
stable thereafter . a marked increase in amphetamine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this substance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some sectors of the drug @-@ using population . this may be the
one of the problems in this area is that the relative roles of illicit and licit substances may be difficult to distinguish .
strategies that address the environment in which young people consume both drugs and alcohol appear to have considerable potential for safeguarding public health and
therapeutic options with robust evidence of effectiveness are generally lacking to guide the treatment of dependence on psychostimulants , such as amphetamines and cocaine .

West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
the growth of the west African cocaine trafficking route has been attributed to several factors .
patterns of cocaine use can be correspondingly diverse , ranging from the occasional and recreational to the highly compulsive and dependent .
the quantity of cocaine seized has also been increasing over the last decade , but with regular fluctuations .
Spain continued to be the country reporting the highest seizures , accounting for 58 % of all seizures and 41 % of the quantity intercepted in Europe that year . the huge increase in the

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe reporting very low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.4 @-@ 1.2 % ) .
it is estimated that around 4 million Europeans have used the drug in the last year ( 1.2 % on average ) , although again national variation between countries is considerable .
the application of recent developments in analytical chemistry to the detection of cocaine in wastewater has introduced a new approach to the monitoring of illicit drug use in the community , known as " sewage epidemiology . "
in the case of cocaine , the main metabolite excreted in the urine is benzoylecgonine .
cocaine use is mainly concentrated among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) .
sewage epidemiology is still in an early stage of development and , as well as important technical and ethical questions , the information it offers must be integrated in to current research thinking .

UnitedKingdom ( 87 ) .
among 30- to 59 @-@ year @-@ olds , the figures were 3.1 % and 1 % respectively .
higher prevalence levels were also reported in a 2004 @-@ 05 French survey of 1496 individuals interviewed in five different electronic music settings .
national estimates of problem cocaine use ( injection or long duration / regular use ) are available only for Spain and Italy , and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
information for the UnitedKingdom is not directly comparable to that of Spain and Italy , as it is based on crack cocaine use .
ever in lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the UnitedKingdom ( 89
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .

Reitox national reports ( 2007 ) , taken from population surveys , reports or scientific articles .
overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
the increasing trend in demand for cocaine treatment noted in previous years also appears to be continuing , even if it is disproportionately influenced by a few countries .
cocaine clients entering outpatient treatment have the highest male to female ratio among drug treatment clients ( five men for every woman ) .
health problems associated with powder cocaine , however , are more likely to go unrecognised and may affect users who might not normally consider themselves at risk .
the first of these are typically more socially integrated , reporting stable housing and employment status , and generally report snorting the drug .
the second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @-@ fatal myocardial infarctions than nonusers ( Qureshi et al . , 2001 ) .
however , it is not possible to generalise directly from this study to Europe .

following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid @-@ oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack @-@ using populations .
however , with the exception of Spain , in 2006 , Member States assessed the availability and accessibility of cocaine @-@ specific treatment programmes as low .
Modafinil , a central nervous system stimulant , has shown particularly promising results as a psychostimulant substitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential substitute drugs ( e.g. d @-@ amphetamine ) , its abuse liability is low ( Myrick et al . , 2004 ) .
of the Member States that report high prevalence levels of cocaine or crack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evaluated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
this technique repeatedly reinforces the drugfree behaviour of the client and provides a regular goal to be achieved .
according to a recent UnitedKingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @-@ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to opioids .
once administered , the vaccine induces the production of antibodies that bind to cocaine molecules in the bloodstream and , thereby , allow naturally occurring enzymes to convert them in to inactive molecules .
as reported in Chapter 4 , Member States are increasingly adopting an integrated approach towards reducing harm related to the use of alcohol and illicit drugs in recreational settings .
heroin supply and availability via south Asia ( Bangladesh ) ( INCB , 2008a ) .
the amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( Figure 6 ) .
however , large seizures of morphine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2007a ) .
global seizures of acetic anhydride ( used in the illicit manufacture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 litres ) and Colombia ( 8 800 litres ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 litres ) ( INCB , 2008b ) .
for Germany , the interval represents the lowest bound of all existing estimates and the highest bound of them , and the point estimate a simple average of the midpoints .

Reitox national focal points .
for example , in some countries where problem opioid use has historically predominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level during the period 2002 @-@ 06 range roughly between one and six casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average prevalence of problem opioid use of between four and five casesper1000 of the population aged 15 @-@ 64 can be derived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it implies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
in 2003 , the downward trend in the number of druginduced deaths reported in Europe , mostly related to the use of opioids , ceased and between 2003 and 2005 most Member States have been reporting an upward trend .
this is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
furthermore , these models can provide only a partial estimate of incidence , as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment .
the EMCDDA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for incidence estimation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( Scalia Tomba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
of the 387 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone : mainly buprenorphine , painkillers and other opioids ( 112 ) .

among opioid users entering outpatient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower proportion report injecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
an analysis of the treatment demand data for nine countries taking part in a pilot study revealed that around 63 % of all opioid clients ( those already in treatment

that among clients already in treatment the proportion of injectors at treatment entrance was relatively high .
many countries conduct regularly repeated studies on groups of injectors , usually in the context of infectious disease testing , that are often recruited from a variety of settings in order to maximise generalisability .
the varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .
the latest available sample for each country during the period 2002 @-@ 06 has been used , subject to there being at least 100 injectors .

see Tables TDI @-@ 17 ( part V ) and TDI @-@ 40 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem opioid users and the reported number of treatments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving substitution treatment .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
about half of opioid users seeking treatment report initiation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 is uncommon ( 120
a buprenorphine / naloxone combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to buprenorphine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attractiveness for injecting use .
in Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
prescription of medical heroin ( diamorphine ) , as a treatment option for chronic treatment @-@ resistant opioid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 815 clients in 2006 ) , the UnitedKingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation .
additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
in February 2008 , it was also decided to introduce a diamorphine prescription scheme in Denmark .
technical information on the substance is available on the EMEA website ( http : / / www.emea.europa.eu / humandocs / humans / EPAR / suboxone / suboxone.htm ) .
substitution treatment , generally integrated with psychosocial care , is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres and in shared @-@ care arrangements with office @-@ based general practitioners . the available data
the Danish National Board of Health , after a review of substitution guidelines , has now urged general practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine instead of methadone .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 2007a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of intervening in this setting .
reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
a recent Cochrane review concluded , however , that buprenorphine is less effective than methadone delivered at adequate doses ( Mattick et al . , 2008 ) .
a number of studies have also found that diamorphine maintenance can be effective for people failing to respond to MMT ( Schulte et al . , in press ) .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
in many countries , detoxification is the preferred and sometimes the only treatment option available .
by the end of 2006 , the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users ( IDUs ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @-@ 02 , which was due to outbreaks in Estonia , countries , HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period .
for details on methods and definitions , see the 2008 statistical bulletin .
although in two of these , regional increases were also reported : in Bulgaria , one city , Sofia ; and in Italy , eight out of 21 regions and one city .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vigilance is needed as some Member States continue to show high rates of new HIV infections linked to injecting drug use , and the situation is even more worrying in some neighbouring countries .
HCV antibody levels among national samples of IDUs in 2005 @-@ 06 vary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in excess of 40 % .
while estimates generated from non @-@ probability samples must always be taken with caution , the variations in prevalence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases of hepatitis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes targeted at IDUs .
access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
as a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care .
prisons are important settings for interventions targeting infectious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see Chapter 2 ) .
Drugrelated deaths and mortality a majority of countries , although services in this area are still being developed .
the EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths ( 136 ) refers to those deaths that are directly caused ( poisonings or overdoses ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @-@ term consequences of infectious diseases , interactions with mental health issues ( e.g. suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e.g. road traffic accidents ) .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circumstantial reasons ( e.g. violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the morbidity and other consequences of non @-@ fatal overdoses and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .
deaths related to opioids
however , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " P . 86 ) .
in general , druginduced deaths occur shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
improvements in the quality and reliability of European data in recent years have allowed better descriptions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case definition in line with that of the
comparisons of population rates should be made with caution , as there are some differences in case definitions and quality of reporting .
Reitox national reports 2007 , taken from national mortality registries or special registries ( forensic or police ) and Eurostat .
the majority of opioid overdose deaths ( 60 @-@ 95 % ) are male , mostly between 20 and 40 years of age , with a mean age in most countries in the mid @-@ thirties ( 142
most of these deaths are attributable to the misuse of methadone diverted from hospitals , pharmacies , practitioners and pain management physicians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to methadone obtained from substitution programmes ( 146 ) .
cocaine @-@ induced deaths are more difficult to define and identify than those related to opioids ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @-@ related .
while similar studies in other countries would be very useful , the available evidence suggests that methadonerelated deaths are more likely to be linked to deficiencies in prescribing practices than to overall levels of substitution treatment .
most deaths with " presence of ecstasy " are reported in the United Kingdom , but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death .
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
a number of factors could be associated with this , including : increases in polydrug use , a possible growth in the availability of heroin or an ageing population of chronic drug users ( 152
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
it should be noted that the proportion of AIDS deaths can be considerably higher in countries with a high HIV prevalence among drug users .
cohort studies area valuable tool for estimating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an overview at national level .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local ( Bargagli et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( Cruts et al . , 2008 ) .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .
a total of 189 deaths were recorded up to 2003 , of which the cause of death could not be identified in 14 cases .
AIDS mortality peaked in the mid @-@ 1990s and has decreased substantially following the introduction and increased coverage of HAART .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area ( see preceding section ) .
drug injectors , in particular , may suffer from high levels of somatic disease , notably chronic infections of the liver , which further increase their vulnerability .
elevated risk of druginduced death on completion of prison sentences or treatment attributed to drug overdoses or , more generally , to substance use disorders .
of the 442 deaths that occurred among the sample during this period , the majority ( 59 % ) were drug @-@ related .
in the period immediately after release , expected rates were exceeded by more than 10 times for women and more than eight times for men .
new patterns of drug use are difficult to detect because , typically , they first emerge at low levels , and in specific localities or among restricted sub @-@ groups of the population .
new substances under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
of these substances , mCPP had been actively monitored by the EMCDDA and Europol , and BZP had been the subject of a risk assessment in 2007 .
in the same period , Tabernanthe iboga has been added to the list of controlled substances in France , following legal control of the active ingredient , ibogaine , in Belgium , Denmark and Sweden .
EU country code domains ( e.g. ES , Fr , de ) or other indications of being EU @-@ based ( e.g. contact address ) were used for the identification of the country of origin .
sampling fractions in each stratum ( country of origin ) were proportional to those of the total sample of online shops .
see " New substances under control . "
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in the body , and there is currently no readily available toxicological test to determine which of the two substances has been consumed .
for example , the average price of a 1 gram dose of GBL purchased in bulk on the Internet varies from EUR 0.09 to EUR 2 .
in particular , anxieties arose about the potential for surreptitiously adding GHB to drinks ( commonly referred to as " drink spiking " ) to facilitate sexual assault .

due to its rapid elimination from the body , it is difficult to establish GHB / GBL as a cause of intoxication or death .
furthermore , there is an absence of an accurate and comparable system for recording the number of deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of GHB and its precursors .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitutes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the EMCDDA 's future activities .
as well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem , the existence of this monitoring system , we believe , results in better and more effective policies .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confronted .
the conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here .
in this year 's report , we give greater prominence to an analysis of supply @-@ side indicators and the drug market .
we do this cautiously , as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality , reliability and comparability of the European data set in this area .
this can be seen in the development of a transversal drug monitoring system that encompasses 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people .
it can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan , tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elaborate it into practical and collective action .

this annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States , the candidate countries Croatia and Turkey , and Norway in the form of a national report .
graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries ; the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
reports of the prevalence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged from 15 to 64 years .
in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " refers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " refers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the proportion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denominator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
the 2009 statistical bulletin ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / stats09 ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model .
the reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UNGASS action plans has been criticised .
although attention is often given to the differences that exist between Member States in their drug policies , from a historical perspective the considerable agreement that is now evident in discussions at European level is striking .
this approach is concretely illustrated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of drugrelated deaths , working in prison settings and improving the quality of treatment and other interventions .
and although the data are difficult to interpret , this observation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area .
this has helped to ensure that , in the final agreement , the key progressive elements of the original 1998 UNGASS documents were preserved .
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
broadly speaking , the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to interdiction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs .
reflecting this , in some countries the legal penalties applicable to supply @-@ related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced .
the extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to gauge .
overall , the number of supply @-@ related offences has increased ; but the number of offences related to possession or use of drugs has also increased , and to an even greater degree .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care .
custodial sentences are common for supply @-@ related offences , but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs , averaging 3 years or less .
a lesson that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practitioners can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
despite the fact that in most countries it is theoretically possible to continue or start substitution treatment within the prison setting , in practice this is often difficult .
as those charged with drug offences are likely to be a diverse group , needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dissuasion of drug abuse . "
the tribunal can issue fines , but sanctioning is not its main objective .
in addition , developments in neuroscience have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addiction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
examples here include a cocaine vaccine , now undergoing a large @-@ scale trial in Europe .
treatment and health interventions : from " one fits all " towards a toolbox of targeted measures
services for drug users in Europe are becoming increasingly diversified and offered as part of an
commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @-@ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young males . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
the estimates presented here relate to the adult population ( 15 @-@ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
subsequently , the situation began to stabilise , and the most recent data strongly support the analysis presented in last year 's report , of an overall decline in the use of this drug .
interestingly , just as different temporal patterns could be seen in the upward trend in cannabis use in the past , this pattern now appears to be repeating itself in reverse .
the United Kingdom , for example , one of the first countries to record high prevalence levels was also one of the earliest to report a decline in use .
standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries , mainly in the north or south of Europe , where levels of cannabis use have remained low and stable for some time .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lifetime users Last month use : less than 1 million
country variation in last year use : overall range 0.0 % to 1.3 %
problem opioid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
a caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
although to what extent this reflects patterns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear .
the EMCDDA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using cannabis on a daily
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a diminishing problem trend in heroin @-@ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indications that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that substance use problems are best addressed holistically and in the context of healthy lifestyles and informed choices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
in Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
however , there is evidence of the further diffusion of the drug into other countries . treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the availability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
data on drugrelated deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreasing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
among older , regular drug users , polydrug use is a major issue in drug overdose , it complicates drug treatment and is associated with violence and offending .
among schoolchildren , the latest data show a strong association between binge drinking and drug use . binge
commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem drinking also often goes hand in hand with recreational drug use , increasing the risks of negative outcomes among young adults .
innovation and precursor availability : interacting factors that are having a growing impact on the market for synthetic drugs
the illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures .
effects on the availability and use of other substances .
again , market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here , with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors , in this case 1 @-@ phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ propanone ( BMK ) , from outside of the European Union .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible outward diffusion of methamphetamine use beyond the Czech Republic .
in this country , methamphetamine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
until 2007 , most ecstasy tablets analysed in Europe contained 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) or another ecstasy @-@ like substance .
changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the EMCDDA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harmreduction interventions , the web @-@ based approaches have considerable potential .
added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicines are those about the appearance of a range of supposedly " legal " alternatives to controlled psychoactive substances .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe obscure research compounds , some are extremely potent , and little is known about their effects on humans .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
new substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
a notable example of this is the herbal mixtures that have been marketed under the " spice " label .
forensic analysis , however , has largely failed to detect the plant @-@ based substances declared on the labels , but did identify in some samples synthetic cannabinoids that had been added to the mixtures .
the cannabinoids found are relatively
moreover , as some of these substances may have legitimate uses or be sold supposedly for legitimate purposes , they can fall between drug control and trade regulation .
other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans , new data and trends on drugrelated public expenditure and developments regarding drugrelated research in Europe .
new UN political declaration and plan of action
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Coordination , cooperation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international cooperation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
EU drugs action plan ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) : new features
the new UN document is similar in content to the original UNGASS declarations and action plans agreed in 1998 .
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
it also examined the action plan 's impact on the national drug policies of EU Member States and looked at recent trends in Europe 's drug situation .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
the evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives attained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that echo those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing convergence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better reflection of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursued in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 2008a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @-@ 08 programme with a 1 @-@ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narcotic Drugs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States .
in most cases , a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament .
most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
labelled and unlabelled expenditure
in some cases , the final report is a summary of annual implementation reviews ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the countries taking the more in @-@ depth approach to evaluation , two ( Luxembourg , Cyprus ) have decided to work with external evaluators from outside the country .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only labelled expenditure .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
the EMCDDA is also developing guidelines to help Member States assess and interpret the results of their drug policy documents .
the results of earlier studies show that , in most cases , unlabelled expenditure represents the greater part of the national expenditure on the drugs problem .
estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
public expenditure related to drugs can be categorised according to the classification of the functions of government ( COFOG ) system ( EMCDDA , 2008e ) .
in contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
during this period , about a quarter of the texts authorised or regulated the use of substances such as methadone and buprenorphine .
halfway through the period , two EU instruments gave added impetus to these processes .
needle and syringe programmes
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
overall , police confiscation of sterile syringes or needles is reported to be rare across the European Union .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EUR 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe research efforts in those priority areas that are underrepresented , in particular drug supply .
analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the EMCDDA in 2008 ( 10 ) .
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports .
the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
participation in European research activities was found to vary considerably between countries , with much of the international cooperation taking place on an informal basis .
the effectiveness of this type of intervention , however , is not supported by the available evidence .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @-@ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combines training in life @-@ skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances .
the responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
gender @-@ dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life @-@ skills programme .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying , past @-@ week and past @-@ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis .
it aims to deter or delay the onset of drug use and drugrelated problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs .
selective and indicated prevention
new information on selective prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selective and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( EMCDDA , 2008c ) .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interventions .
similarly , the " Komet för föräldrar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing externalising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive peer relations .
its evaluation found that negative social norms against cannabis smoking were reinforced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on normative beliefs ( Wammes et al . , 2007 ) .
there was , however , evidence that the campaign had unintended effects in favour of cannabis , and individuals who had previously been uninterested in the drug , reported an intention to use it ( Hornik et al . , 2008 ) .
Psychosocial interventions form the foundation of communitybased outpatient and inpatient treatment , and they also normally complement opioid substitution treatment . drug detoxification is a
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe short @-@ term , medically supervised intervention aimed at resolving the withdrawal symptoms associated with chronic drug use .
according to national experts , this type of treatment is available to the majority of those who seek it in 10 countries , and available to nearly all of them in a further 13 countries .
in four countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Romania , Turkey ) , however , outpatient psychosocial treatment is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1A ) .
it is generally provided as an outpatient treatment , though in some countries it is also available in inpatient settings .
in Turkey , substitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public outpatient services are the main providers of substitution treatment .
see Tables HSR @-@ 1 and HSR @-@ 2 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.See Table HSR @-@ 3 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
the mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years , but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 28 ) and cannabis ( 26 ) .
most inpatient clients are men , with an overall male to female ratio of 3.6 : 1 .
the ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
national experts estimate that inpatient psychosocial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
the scarcity of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available , and this points to the need for more multisite randomised controlled trials in these fields .
it is commonly , but not exclusively , an inpatient intervention provided in hospitals , specialist treatment centres or residential facilities with medical or psychiatric wards .
five Member States evaluate substitution and detoxification treatment , and only Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom evaluate the outcome of psychosocial treatment interventions on a regular basis .
single or irregular treatment outcome evaluations are also reported by some countries .
public institutions are the main providers of detoxification in 21 countries .
nongovernmental organisations are the largest providers in Belgium ( Flanders ) and the Netherlands , while the private sector is predominant in Luxembourg and Bulgaria .
it includes a synthesis of findings about the efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial treatment for opioid , stimulant and cannabis disorders , based on the latest reviews .
efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out controlled trials or randomised controlled trials where interventions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @-@ breaking work on new agents for opioid substitution treatment .
responsibility for quality assurance lies with national institutions in 14 countries , while in countries with a federal system , agencies at sub @-@ national level can be in charge .
guidance can be underpinned by research findings on cost @-@ effectiveness , as is the case in the United Kingdom 's guidance on needle and syringe programmes ( nice , 2009 ) .
the new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
this figure is likely to be much higher for certain groups of drug users .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
the focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV / AIDS epidemic into the broader perspective of catering for the health and social needs of problem drug users , especially those who are socially excluded .
all Member States report the availability of housing schemes that can accommodate drug users .
information on the extent to which the housing needs of drug users are met , however , is scarce .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consensual crime , " where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e.g. during a foot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study , which found that recovering drug users who received employment @-@ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( McIntosh et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at disrupting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing importation and exportation requests as well as identifying and investigating suspicious transactions .

cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world .
the use of cannabis in Europe has evolved considerably over the last decade , as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @-@ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis related problems .

the number of plants seized was 2.4 million , a figure that has been relatively stable over the past 2 years , up from about 1.5 million in 2002 .
global production of cannabis resin in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes ( UNODC , 2009 ) , with Morocco continuing to be the main producer .

population surveys : an important tool for understanding drug use patterns and trends in Europe
drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
the extent to which the samples analysed reflect the overall market is unclear and , for this reason , data on potency should be interpreted with caution .
the mean potency of herbal cannabis , excluding home @-@ grown sinsemilla ( " nederwiet " ) in the Netherlands , ranged from 1.2 % to 10.2 % .
however , upward trends in the mean THC content of cannabis resin were registered in Portugal and Luxembourg .
information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed , from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
the EMCDDA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in adult surveys ( the " European Model Questionnaire , " EMQ ) .
surveys are expensive to conduct and few European countries collect information each year , although many collect it at intervals of two to four years .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
the mean retail price of cannabis resin , in 2007 , ranged from EUR 3 to EUR 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information , with half of them reporting values between EUR 5 and EUR 9 .
the mean retail price of herbal cannabis ranged between EUR 1 and EUR 12 per gram in the 17 countries supplying information , with about half of them reporting prices of between EUR 4 and EUR 9 .
the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( ESPAD ) uses standardised methods and instruments to measure drug and alcohol use among representative samples of 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students .
for most of the countries , the prevalence estimates are in the range 10 @-@ 30 % .
it is estimated that around 22.5 million Europeans have used cannabis in the last year , or on average 6.8 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the average prevalence for Europe was computed by a weighted average according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .

national prevalence estimates of cannabis use vary widely between countries in all measures of prevalence , with countries at the upper end of the scale reporting values up to 10 times those of the lowest @-@ prevalence countries .
for example , the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 : 1 in Portugal to 1.4 : 1 in Austria .

as with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .
other studies suggested that cannabis dependence can be relatively stable over time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) . nevertheless , probably over half of

internet @-@ based treatment is developed by organisations in the treatment or prevention fields and aims at helping users to assess their substance use and to assist them in their attempts to change this behaviour .

using amphetamines and ecstasy or other drugs such as ketamine and GHB .
users of amphetamines generally receive treatment in outpatient drug services which , in countries with histories of significant levels of the use of amphetamines , can be specialised in treating this type of drug problem .
an indication of the extent to which the use of these drugs may be concentrated among the young , club @-@ going population can be gleaned from the 2007 / 08 British Crime Survey .
in the other six countries , national experts estimate that specialised amphetamines treatment is available to less than half of the users seeking it .
promising results have been reported for recent investigations on pharmacological agents to manage abstinence or reduce the cravings associated with amphetamines dependence , which up to now have been lacking .
Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales , where it may be prescribed by any doctor . however , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .

the fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a lesser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
only a small proportion of those who have used cocaine at least once in their life appear to develop intensive patterns of use .
the lack of data in this area makes this analysis necessarily speculative and underlines the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influence Europe 's drug market .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.8 % ( 1 million ) .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime , on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15 @-@ 64 years ( see Table 8 for a summary of the data ) .
national figures vary from 0.1 % to 8.3 % , with 12 out of 23 countries , including most central and eastern European countries , reporting low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.5 @-@ 2 % ) .
cocaine use is also associated with alcohol use and certain lifestyles .
for purity and price data , see Tables PPP @-@ 3 and PPP @-@ 7 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use , as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine , compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club .
lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students in the ESPAD survey is between 1 % and 2 % in half of the 28 reporting countries .

chapter 5 : cocaine and crack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
crack cocaine use in Europe
in 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered outpatient treatment for primary use of crack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in outpatient treatment .
it has been feared that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but , until now , a serious crack epidemic has not been observed .
crack cocaine is , however , used in some European cities , although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon .
the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
sizable crack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries .
some countries ( e.g. Ireland , Italy , Spain ) , however , have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users , and France is in the process of developing such programmes .
for this reason , in Ireland outreach work and other interventions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) .
among them , 42 % also use alcohol , 28 % cannabis and 16 % heroin . cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug ,
( 101 ) See Tables TDI @-@ 10 , TDI @-@ 11 ( part III ) , TDI @-@ 21 and TDI @-@ 103 ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . ( 102 ) See Table TDI @-@ 17 ( part IV ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
in the United Kingdom , a clinical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in conjunction with contingency management ( see EMCDDA , 2008b ) in primary cocaine users .
according to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
it is the largest trial conducted on this vaccine to date , with several hundred volunteers participating .
these difficulties can be tackled by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adapted to the problems associated with cocaine and crack use .
cocaine @-@ specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
a decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years , though more recent data suggest that , in some countries , the trend may have changed direction .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 735 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported wholesale price of heroin ranges from EUR 12.5 to EUR 35.8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ranges from EUR 36 to EUR 62.7 .
at both wholesale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
the ratio between retail and wholesale price also varies considerably , from 1.6 : 1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8 : 1 in the United Kingdom .
nonetheless , analysis in this area can be informative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002 @-@ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .
overall , of the around 325 000 treatment entries for which the primary drug is known , 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug ; if other opioids are included , time ( 112 ) .
1 11 those clients who were in treatment for more than 1 year was reported to be over 50 % in all countries participating in the study .
clients entering treatment for primary opioid use often report the use of other drugs .
a recent analysis of data on clients in drug treatment in 14 countries found that primary opioid users and alcohol ( 7 % ) ( 113 ) .
it has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Zurich , a study to test a new " one @-@ day " method using the distribution of " latency time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @-@ sectional sample of treated heroin users .
in at least five regions , the incidence estimates allowed the derivation of prevalence estimates that were in a good accordance with other existing estimates ( e.g. by the capture @-@ recapture method ) .
similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @-@ related cases may also be observed .
this is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seizures and druginduced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . information from the
injecting drug use is one of the main determinants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hepatitis C and overdose .
the lowest proportions of injectors among opioid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands , and the highest by Lithuania , Latvia and Romania ( 120 ) .
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
an increase was also observed in Cyprus .
the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the proportion of injectors among primary opioid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statistically significant declines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly

Comorbidity : drug use and mental disorders
prescription opioids may enter the illicit drug market through the diversion of substitution drugs from their proper use .
internet pharmacies seem also to play a substantial role in the availability of prescription opioids in the United States ( INCB , 2009a ) , but their role in Europe appears to be limited .
the mental disorders most commonly reported among drug users in Europe include depression , anxiety , schizophrenia , personality disorders , attention deficit and hyperactivity .
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
a European prospective multi @-@ centre study ( Isadora ) has recently been conducted involving dual @-@ diagnosis patients
its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
the German Phar @-@ Mon system , which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids , where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics ( Roesner and Küfner , 2007 ) .
in the Member States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised ( Cherny et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
almost all opioid users entering treatment report initiation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .

the range of options available in Europe for the treatment of opioid dependence is broad and increasingly differentiated , though it varies geographically in terms of accessibility and coverage .
drug @-@ free and substitution treatment for opioid use are available in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway . in Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
NB : the percentage of substitution treatment clients receiving their treatment from general practitioners in the Community is indicated on the map.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for opioid substitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in substitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the availability of opioid substitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of opioid users ( see Chapter 2 ) .
in those countries , drug @-@ free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of opioid users .

the most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) , which indicates a history of infection .
for 2006 @-@ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 137 ) .
ten of these 23 countries also report existing strategies to prevent infectious diseases at local or regional level .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .

to reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
needle and syringe programmes exist in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway .
current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
the number of syringes provided through needle and syringe programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
ongoing increases over this period were reported from Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia and Finland .
Multidisciplinary teams , which can manage drug dependence , liver treatment and co @-@ morbid mental problems , improve treatment outcomes ( Grebely et al . , 2007 ) .
a national survey conducted in the 120 French " CAARUD " harmreduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( Toufik et al . , 2008 ) .
in the United Kingdom , a new needle exchange monitoring system was established in 2008 .

training in health promotion , based on formal curricula or training handbooks , is offered to staff of needle and syringe programmes in 20 countries and to pharmacists in nine countries .
known causes of deaths include acute toxicity , traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol ( EMCDDA , 2007c ) , violence , suicide among already vulnerable people , or chronic conditions due to repeated use ( e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users ) .
during the period 1990 @-@ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 135 000 deaths . in 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
among Europeans aged 15 @-@ 39 years , drug overdose accounted for 4 % of all deaths ( 145 ) .
in the 22 countries providing data , opioids accounted for 35 % to almost 100 % of all cases , with 11 of these countries reporting proportions of over 85 % ( 146 ) .
an epidemic of fentanyl poisonings in Estonia caused the death of 117 injecting drug users in 2005 / 06 ( EMCDDA , 2008b ) .

this suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered druginduced deaths .
this type of study can determine overall and cause @-@ specific mortality rates for the cohort , and can estimate the group 's excess mortality compared to the general population .
both methods have been successfully pilot @-@ tested in the Czech Republic , and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
France , Italy and Portugal . following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 , HIV / AIDS mortality decreased markedly in most EU countries , although the decrease was much less pronounced in Portugal .
in Italy , France and Latvia , HIV / AIDS mortality and overdose mortality are of similar levels ( 153 ) .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a proportion of deaths among drug users include chronic conditions such as liver diseases ( due to hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardiovascular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indications that they have a considerable impact .
for instance , trauma ( accidents , homicides and other violence ) and suicide could account for 25 % or more of the mortality of problem drug users . a literature review
) The year 2006 was taken as the more recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .
for detailed information on sources , for the transmission groups , numbers and computations see Table DRD @-@ 5 ( part III ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
in recent cohort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data .
reducing drugrelated deaths families of drug users to recognise and manage drug overdoses ; in eight countries , such materials are available for police officers ; and in seven countries , they have been developed for prison staff ( 155 ) .
education about overdose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
thirteen countries have neither a specific strategy or a section of the national drug strategy dedicated to the reduction of druginduced deaths , and two countries reported no information .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
overdose response training is not available in Estonia , Hungary and Turkey .
no information is available from Bulgaria , Germany and France .
experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to prevent drugrelated deaths . )
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .
during the first 3 months , all 12 overdoses where naloxone was used had been reversed successfully , while one death had occurred in the six overdoses in which it was not used .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @-@ release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .
they estimated that between two and 12 deaths a year may have been averted ( Milloy et al . , 2008 ) .
the chemical make @-@ up of the two plants reported - kratom and kava - is relatively well known from the literature .
they have been traditionally used in other parts of the world and their presence on the European drug scene seems to be limited .
the appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of " designer drugs " : from those based on fentanyl in the 1980s ; to ring @-@ substituted phenethylamines in the late 1980s and tryptamines in 1990s ; to piperazines and cathinone derivatives in the 2000s .
the main active principles of kratom are mitragynine , mitraphylline and 7 @-@ hydroxymitragynine ; though mitragynine is probably responsible for kratom 's analgesic activity and for relieving the opioid withdrawal symptoms .
a tea brewed from the roots of the plant can be taken for its anti @-@ anxiety and relaxant effects .
products marketed on the Internet and in some specialised shops under the name " spice " have been available since at least 2006 . although " spice " may be advertised as incense , when smoked the effects are described by some users as similar to those of cannabis .
following a report from Sweden , the early @-@ warning system has been monitoring " spice " products since the beginning of 2008 .
the chemical structure of JWH @-@ 018 differs substantially from that of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the main active principle in all cannabis products .
in experimental animals , JWH @-@ 018 produces the same effects as THC , and has been reported to be more potent .
early in 2009 , a second synthetic cannabinoid , CP 47,497 ( 160 ) , and three of its homologues were detected in " spice " samples in Europe .
Packaging information on " spice " products indicates that they are composed of as many as 14 ingredients of plant origin .
while at least two of the ingredients - Pedicularis densiflora and Leonotis leonurus - may have some psychoactive effect , little is known about the pharmacology and toxicology of the plant materials purportedly contained in " spice " products .
the online marketplace has implications for the potential spread of new psychoactive substances , and monitoring it is an increasingly important element of identifying new drug trends .
in particular , it is necessary to focus on the risks associated with the substances offered for sale .
in seven countries , national risk assessment may be carried out on an ad @-@ hoc basis , when necessary .
and , in three countries ( Netherlands , Austria , United Kingdom ) , risk assessment is performed by independent scientific bodies .
Austria used its medicines act to prohibit smoking mixes containing six synthetic cannabinoids from being imported or marketed in the country .

demonstration of wealth and status .
in this policy briefing the different types of offences that might be encompassed under a general heading of drug @-@ related crime are explored .
for the career criminal , drugs may form part of the deviant lifestyle , with spending on drugs being a
the effects of such drugs include excitability , irritability , fear / paranoia , disinhibition , drastic mood swings , cognitive distortions and impaired judgement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
it is also important to include in this category crimes induced by the victim 's own drug use . such crimes are less visible , because many go unreported .
however , such a definition of drug @-@ related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent , patterns and trends .
in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some subgroups of the population of drug @-@ using offenders or to some types of drug @-@ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may vary even in the same person over time .
this category of drug @-@ related crime also includes the forging of prescriptions and the burgling of pharmacies by drug users , both of which provide medicines that can be used as substitutes for illicit products .
the use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tranquillisers ) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression .
however , irritability associated with the withdrawal syndrome , as well as related mental health problems , may be linked to increased violence .
although many acquisitive crimes committed by drug users are opportunistic , some require more skill and others involve some specialisation .
while the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances , usually stimulants , are known to produce
additionally , from a policy perspective , it is helpful to include a legal definition model , in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug @-@ related crime .
the resulting conceptual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the definition of the term " drugrelated crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use / traffi cking and crime , mostly in the United States .
those whose drug use needs to be supported by illegal income , which will be determined by their type and pattern of substance use , socioeconomic situation and extent of deviant lifestyle .
however , some studies have attempted to estimate the proportion of different types of offence that are drug @-@ related and then apply this fraction to produce overall estimates of drug @-@ related crime .
in drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged , systemic crimes may also encompass , for example , corruption of businesses , governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffickers. ckers .
Studies of drug @-@ related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
systemic violence is linked to prohibition as it stems mainly from the illicit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants cannot resort to standard business law .
the four categories of drug @-@ related crime suggested , and the models on which they are derived , are not mutually exclusive .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
this would make such crimes relatively less costly ( through reduced probability of arrest and shortened incarceration ) and therefore may increase their incidence .
cocaine use in Europe : implications for service delivery
no proven effective substitution or pharmacological treatment options currently available for cocaine users .
powder cocaine is typically snorted ( insufflated ) and , less frequently , injected .
it produces euphoria and appetite suppression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified : socially well @-@ integrated individuals ; opioid users , some of whom are substitution treatment clients ; and marginalised crack users .
acute and chronic cocaine use , often in combination with other substances , can cause multiple disorders ( cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , neurological , psychiatric , etc . ) .
cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
this group is mainly composed of males , often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks .
different groups of users
for example , surveys in recreational nightlife settings show prevalence rates 5 to 20 times higher among clubbers than among
the second group uses both opioids and cocaine .
the number of treatment demands related to cocaine use has increased in recent years , notably among those entering treatment for the first time ( Figure 2 ) .
United States , research on their transferability to Europe is urgently required .
they might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat .
it is the smallest of the three groups ( 2.5 % of all European clients in treatment ) and has only been identified in a few locations .
research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available , both for positive as well as negative outcomes .
finally , cocaine users who are undergoing opioid substitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dosage of methadone or buprenorphine .
however , as these approaches and the research about their effectiveness come almost exclusively from the
drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug @-@ released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the " reward system " - circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
a growing body of research suggests that chronic drug use can produce long @-@ term disruptions in the modulation of neurocognitive circuits involved in motivation and attention , decision @-@ making and the ability to inhibit impulses .
Neurobiological research in addiction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse disrupts this regulation .
we must , however , ensure that such beneficial new approaches are rigorously evaluated prior to implementation to ensure maximum success and financial efficiency . "
they stimulate different cerebral structures , such as the prefrontal cortex , the amygdala and the hippocampus , which are part of a circuitry called the " reward system . "
animal studies and other evidence suggest great variability in vulnerability to addiction .
new technologies mean that neurobiological research can start to identify neuropsychological and genetic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addiction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addiction research non @-@ invasive techniques which may help to identify neuropsychological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's inability to stop using drugs .
this dysregulation would correspond either to an increased reactivity of dopaminergic neurons to specific stimuli linked to the pleasurable and addictive product or to a down @-@ regulation of dopamine signalling and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway .
in natural situations , dopamine is released when a rewarding experience is new , better than expected or unanticipated .
this release of dopamine helps the individual to memorise signals announcing a reward .
animal studies indicate that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons are coupled ( i.e. limit the activity of each other )
progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
causal models of addiction treating addiction , possibly because the wrong dopamine receptor has been targeted ( i.e. D2 ) or because other modulatory neurotransmitter systems also require consideration .
choices or act upon them . drug use encompasses a complex set of behaviours and even the autonomy of dependent individuals is variable .
even today , some authors remain sceptical about the existence of addiction , and the extent to which dependent individuals have autonomy over their actions remains a question of fundamental importance .
a number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being researched which may provide new approaches to treating some forms of drug dependence .

this continues to have considerable environmental and economic consequences .
although the level of extraction of resources within Europe has remained stable , and in some cases has even decreased - some unmanaged burdens from past extraction persist related to mining closures .
the high use of resources to fuel economic growth increases the problems of ensuring supplies and sustainable yields , and managing the environmental impacts in relation to ecosystems ' absorption capacities .
a challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use .
factors that affect resource efficiency include the technological level of production and consumption ; the share of services versus heavy industry ; regulatory and tax systems ; and the share of imports in total resource use .

ultimately , environmental pressures that result from , for example , climate change , biodiversity loss , or the use of natural resources , are linked with people 's wellbeing ( chapters 2 to 5 ) .
many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct , i.e. changes in the state of one environmental issue can translate directly into pressures of another .

at the EU and national levels , there are different sectoral and environmental policies and measures that may conflict with water management and the objective of achieving a good ecological status of water bodies .

as in the past , future climate change impacts are expected to affect disproportionately the most vulnerable in society : children , the elderly , and the poor .
however , this too raises the question about the sharing of access and benefits , since often spatial planning and investment decisions favour the rich at the expense of the poor .
crises such as these have also shown how difficult it is for society to deal with risks . well signposted and numerous early warnings

the desire to make economic and social progress that does not come at the expense of the natural environment is not new .
in some cases , natural capital that is depleted can be substituted by other types of capital , such as non @-@ renewable energy resources that are used to develop and invest in renewable energy sources .
since the industrial revolution there has been a shift away from using renewable resources to non @-@ renewables to fuel our economy .
the Water Framework Directive , for example , has the aim of protecting ecosystems - aquatic and terrestrial - at its core .
this creates a need for accounting techniques - including , in particular , comprehensive accounting of land and water resources - that make transparent the full costs and benefits of ecosystem use and maintenance .
examples of such initiatives are The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) , the revision of Integrated Environmental and

the key messages in this year 's report highlight the need to make further progress in managing the environmental impacts of agriculture , transport and energy .
the spin @-@ off benefits for the environment and human health will be multi @-@ dimensional across issues such as climate change , air pollution , biodiversity and water quality .
ozone pollution levels were especially high , while unusually low water flows were recorded in the Danube , Rhine and other major rivers , in sharp contrast with the heavy flooding the summer before .
for example , water quality data need to become more statistically representative at catchment level , while air quality monitoring for small particles ( PM
the European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accurate as possible .
Europe 's environment should be considered in the context of socio @-@ economic agendas , such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development , that also have a strong global dimension .
the main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex , inter @-@ sectoral , inter @-@ disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions .
the Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be � ER jobs , but progress towards its objectives is mixed .
reducing regional disparities , the main goal of the European Union 's cohesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � ER ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Cohesion Report , February 2004 ) .
these in turn are influencing consumption PA � erns and spatial planning decisions , with transport in particular playing an increasingly pivotal role in the economy and people 's lives .
the pressures on urban agglomerations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest .
the consumption demand PA � erns of older people tend to Shi � towards services such as social and leisure activities , including tourism , with consequent environmental impacts .
so , for example , the explosive increase in air travel , which is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions , reflects in part these changes in demography .
semi @-@ natural and extensively farmed areas are very vulnerable to changes in land management such as the cessation of grazing and mowing , which contribute to the maintenance of high biological diversity in these areas .
the continued potential for saving energy is widely recognised .
in the energy supply sector the opportunities for improvement focus in the short term on further switching to more efficient natural gas @-@ powered production , and in the longer term on increasing use of combined heat and power and decentralising electricity generation .
in particular the domestic sector 's demand for electricity and transport are rising in line with increasing wealth and the growing number of smaller households .
end @-@ of @-@ pipe technology has reduced air pollutant emissions from power generation , but as the possibilities are narrowing for some key lowcarbon technologies , such as largescale hydro @-@ electric power , other options need to be explored .
the current policy tools for dealing with waste are inadequate and need to be complemented by approaches that promote smarter resource use by changing production and consumption PA � erns and through innovation .
most new areas have been created at the expense of agricultural land , but are also encroaching on forested land .
built @-@ up areas have a heavy impact on soil function : where the topsoil is taken off during construction , removing the built surface would not restore the soil to a useful resource .
however , by 2003 the sites designated by
as well as taking a higher share of the total agricultural budget it is important that rural development expenditure , and in particular the agrienvironment schemes , is properly targeted at areas of high biodiversity .
Spain and Greece , for example , spent around EUR 4 per hectare on AGRI @-@ environmental schemes in 2000 @-@ 2002 while in Finland and Austria the figure was around EUR 80 per hectare .
across the EEA @-@ 31 as a whole , however , organic farming area increased by around four fi � hs between 1997 and 2000 , to 4.4 million hectares from 2.4 million .

arable land cover ( % of total upstream catchment )
increases may either reflect the time @-@ lag between changes in agricultural practices and their effects on groundwater quality or show a need for additional measures .
Marine areas should be protected according to the richness of their biodiversity , but this protection may conflict with other uses including shipping or fishing .
catches of open sea fish account for almost two thirds of all catches ; about half of these catches are outside safe limits .
fish play an integral role within the wider marine environment , which is experiencing pressures from shipping , pollution , coastal eutrophication and climate change .
projections show that global warming will increasingly change the composition of the ecosystems in the Oceans and cause a Shi � by warm @-@ water species towards higher latitudes .
while many countries have met the targets for recycling set under the 1994 packaging waste directive , the amount of packaging waste is still increasing .
some of this increase is a � ributable to the proportionately higher generation of packaging waste from small households , but also to the growth of the internal market and the consequently greater need to transport packaged goods .
an initial analysis ( 23 ) suggests that for some countries ( e.g. Italy and Ireland ) the directive has had a positive impact on the implementation of packaging waste management systems .
the soundness of recycling as a strategy for smarter resource use has recently been questioned ( 25 ) , but recycling is in most cases be � ER for the environment than either energy recovery or disposal .
the directive 's targets are to be met by the end of 2008 .
despite some growth in absolute terms , renewable energy is not expected to raise its share significantly , while the contribution of nuclear power is projected to decline .

Decoupling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results .
freight volumes are growing faster than the economy ( at around 3 % a year compared with 2 % , for the 15 older EU Member States ) ( 31 ) .
this largely reflects the pan @-@ European production and consumption PA � erns that are accompanying the expansion of the EU internal market .
air transport is growing by 6 @-@ 9 % per year in both the old and new EU Member States .
prices are an important factor for steering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of user prices are relevant .
there is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities , although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid .
the most important variable element is taxation on fuel , but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years .
implementing full @-@ cost pricing could help reduce environmental impacts in the same way as regulating air pollutants has led to substantial decreases in the regulated emissions .
the reasons are complex but largely linked to socio @-@ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in freight transport .

further improvements will take place as even stricter regulations come into force in the coming years and as older vehicles are replaced with newer ones .
sulphur dioxide is a different case : large reductions in road transport emissions ( 61 % ) have been offset by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport .
further action is needed to bring down pollution , especially as limits and targets may be tightened in response to growing evidence of health impacts at concentrations below the current values .

the emission cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU solvents directive , which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes .
discussions are under way within the framework of the EU Clean Air for Europe process ( 35 ) that may lead to present limits being reconsidered and eventually tightened .
the urban population for which exposure estimates can be made increased from 51 to 103 million people over the same period .
data reliability has therefore increased substantially , but data between 1996 and 2001 make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on exposure trends for either ozone or particulates .
the reduction in emissions is mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars ( cu � ing emissions of nitrogen oxides ) and the implementation of the EU solvents directive ( limiting emissions of non @-@ methane volatile organic compounds from industrial processes ) .
ozone limits are exceeded mainly in central and southern
combating climate change is a key environmental priority for the European Union .
the average temperature in Europe has increased by 0.95 ° C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.3 ° C by 2100 .
other impacts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years .
however , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counteracted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm vegetation .
the Kyoto Protocol has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised countries to 5 % below 1990 levels by the period 2008 @-@ 2012 .
a recent study confirms previous estimates that to mitigate climate change in the longer term much larger global emission reductions would be needed ( 37 ) .
for example , the United Kingdom and Germany have reduction targets of 60 % and 30 % ( from 1990 levels ) , to be met by 2050 and 2030 respectively .

Europe 's rich cultural and natural heritage is reflected in its traditional agricultural landscapes .
many marginal and extensively farmed areas were either improved or abandoned , thus considerably reducing habitat and species diversity .
Seminatural vegetation has declined rapidly and roughly two thirds of the currently endangered bird species depend on agricultural habitats .
we sincerely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elaborate and refine the high nature value farmland concept , and further focus their conservation efforts .
both are considered detrimental to biodiversity .
the target is to cover ' a substantial proportion ' of such areas with rural development and agrienvironment measures by 2008 . a high nature value farmland indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of IRENA1 .
it should be kept in mind , though , that the current data do not allow for detailed geographical analysis .
the biodiversity of farmland , however , has rapidly declined across Europe in the last few decades , as illustrated here for common birds of the countryside ( Figure 1 , see also Donald et al . , 2001 ) .
biodiversity generally decreases when the intensity of farming increases ( in terms of nutrient and pesticide

preliminary data on the distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland are obtained on the basis of a European2 indicator developed for the
appendix B for additional ( but spatially non explicit ) data for central and eastern European countries .
loss of extensive grassland habitat is reflected by the large @-@ scale decline of the corncrake Crex crex .
loss of seminatural vegetations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . although many case studies exist ( see for example Veen and Seffer , 1999 ) , no reliable panEuropean trend data are currently available for plant communities and habitats .
farmland birds are indicative of overall biodiversity , since they depend on a variety of plant and animal food and diverse vegetation structures for feeding , nesting and
the relatively small number of priority species in northern Europe does not necessarily reflect low nature value or absence of conservation problems , since species richness generally decreases with latitude .

in addition , there are ceilings on stocking densities in many regions , but these are o � en set at a level that is too high from a conservation point of view .

although no precise data are available on geographical spending PA � erns within countries , the targeting of agrienvironment measures at a European level seems far from optimal from a biodiversity conservation perspective .
as such they are potentially an effective tool for preventing abandonment of high nature

there is a need for future revisions on the basis of updated and more detailed data , and for refinements on the basis of national datasets .
due to the limitations of the Corine land cover data , Type 2 high nature value farmland tends to be underrepresented in the minimum estimate ( for example bocage landscapes in France ) .
type 3 farmland is also only partially included .
for Finland and Sweden , the distribution PA � ern of potential high nature value farmland is also optimistic due to interpretation

expenditure figures per hectare could therefore not be used here , and for this reason Greece was excluded from the calculations .

evaluation and authorisation of Chemicals ( reach ) , which entered into force in 2007 .
emissions of greenhouse gases have increased in recent years in most European countries and are projected to continue to do so in the future .
it is therefore also urgent to adapt to those impacts in developing and implementing policies and measures in all sectors of society .

the aim of the EEA is to ensure that decision @-@ makers and the general public are kept informed about the state and outlook of the environment .
it also illustrated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors .
over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda , which is lasting proof of the EEA 's work , and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever .
in addition , and looking to the next five years , I would like to highlight some of the EEA 's strategic issues .
the 5 @-@ year State of Environment reports and the pan @-@ European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes .
it also has a key role to play in ensuring the appropriate connection between discussions taking place in scientific and political arenas .

new ways of identifying emerging environmental problems
through our newly formatted publication Signals , we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to weigh heavily on the agenda for the coming year .
our work is based on the precautionary principle , evaluation of the burden of evidence , decision @-@ making under varying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision @-@ support models and scenarios .
at the EEA , we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets ; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy .
in the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can embed ecosystem services to restructure the global economy .
as more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives , the demand for reliable local information has grown explosively .
providing information through the EEA 's networks has been a unique and positive experience .
the EEA has been extending and building its networks and sources for observing and knowledge @-@ gathering through its global citizen environment observatory .
today , the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this .
at the same time , citizens remain concerned about climate change , the quality of air they breathe , how to deal with waste and the impacts of chemicals .
they have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations .
• Information services and communications .
it is difficult to see ... how the provision of impartial and reliable information , could be performed through any of the possible other mechanisms available for European organisations ' .
the Environmental Data Centres include climate change , water , air , biodiversity , and land use ( managed by EEA ) , forests and soils ( managed by JRC ) and waste , natural resources and products ( managed by Eurostat ) .
one of the fundamental roles of the EEA is to support EU environmental policy by tracking and reporting on the outcomes of the implementation of EU environmental legislation across all EEA member countries .

EU policy has now adopted an ' ecosystem approach ' to the management of human activities on the marine environment through its strategies and directives .
in a globalised economy where individuals , businesses and governments can exert a global reach , many different types of policy can affect the resilience of the natural environment and the resources it provides whether on land or at sea .
data from the various global observing and in @-@ situ measurement programmes also show that we are experiencing conditions outside the most pessimistic estimates from the IPCC 2007 report .
there will also be an emphasis on studies that highlight the need for early action and on the benefits of preventive and precautionary measures .

growing waste volumes of Luxembourg 30 cm thick or Malta 2.5 m thick !
however , as shown in Figure 1 , there are significant differences
if we were simply to spread all EU municipal waste generated in 2020 ( i.e. about 340 million tonnes ) on the ground , it would cover an area the size between EU ‑ 15 (
national and European levels to achieve , among other things , the objectives set in the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
Landfilling represents 60 % of the total in 2020 , and recycling and incineration about 20 % each .
overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Sixth Environment Action Programme .

what is Signals a story @-@ based approach to help us better communicate with this diverse group of people.The eight stories addressed are not exhaustive but have been selected on the basis of their relevance to the current environmental policy debate in Europe .
from researchers up to their knees in water to satellite imaging from space , we work with a huge amount of environmental data .
finding , reading and understanding the range of " signals " regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what we do .
initiatives like Stern have helped people to understand what is at stake if we continue our current consumption patterns .
our natural world is the bedrock - not the backdrop - of our society.With Signals , we intend to contribute to this appreciation of the natural environment .
it should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new , more sustainable patterns of living , growing , producing and consuming . ultimately , we are talking about revaluing the fundamental elements of life .
on a grander scale , we are struck by the beauty of the Alps or the Carpathian mountains , the ancient forests , the great rivers or the stunning coasts .
the world 's economy , in terms of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , has grown at an unprecedented rate : in 1950 GDP was EUR 4 trillion .
this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
in contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .
the natural resources provided by the planet underpin our economic activity and the very cohesion of our societies . however , the way we organise our economies does not give sufficient recognition to the dependent nature of this relationship - there are no societies without environments ,
every winter the gates of Copenhagen 's famous Tivoli gardens , an old world amusement park in the city centre , open to officially mark the beginning of the extended Christmas period .
it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest . the summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
from agriculture are estimated based on the area of cultivated soils , type of crop , use of fertiliser and the number of livestock ( cattle , poultry , sheep , pigs , etc . ) in the country .
data from around Europe on emissions of so @-@ called greenhouse gases are collected , verified and then analysed in two key reports that feed into the Kyoto process .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
the inventory report - counting gases
the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
they must achieve this target during the period 2008 @-@ 2012 ( 2 ) .Countries are expected to meet their Kyoto targets mainly by cutting emissions at home .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to Kyoto on time ) . ' Kyoto ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
immediately after the hand @-@ over of the ' inventory ' report , the EEA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culminating in the ' Trends and projections ' report .
the first EEA greenhouse gas report comes out each spring and is called the ' inventory ' report .
greenhouse gases in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gases including : carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide as well as fluorinated gases .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total greenhouse gases emissions in the EU .
different gases have different ' base years ' under Kyoto . for carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide ( 99 % of all emissions ) 1990 is used as the ' base year ' for all EU @-@ 15 Member States .
within this , each EU @-@ 15 Member State has a differentiated reduction target : some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase .
the EU ' emissions Trading scheme ' ( EU ETS ) is another tool , which helps
gap between 2010 projections ( existing measures ) and Kyoto target
the buzz words , ' common but differentiated responsibility ' , first uttered at the Earth Summit in Rio , have popped up ever since in climate change circles .
in simple language the phrase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
next December , a major task of the Cop 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
if the water is off for a really long time we go to my father 's place or to my wife 's parents , ' says Barış , an economics professor at Marmara University .
the old apartment does not have a water tank of its own so the Tekins ' are directly connected to the city 's water system .
current droughts and water crisis must be dealt with in the short term to ensure that people have water .
governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
Extremes of heat and drought , rain and flooding are affecting many parts of Europe .
however , even if emissions stop today , climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
EU Member States agree that global temperature increases should be limited to 2 ° C above pre @-@ industrial levels in order to avoid severe changes to our climate .
limiting temperature increases to 2 ° C
at the same time , agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hotter drier regions.An increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality .
also , the salty brine , a by product of the process is difficult to dispose of and can harm the environment .
desalination is expected to double over the next 50 years in Spain.Water shortages are not restricted to Southern Europe .
at a cost of GBP 200m , more than EUR 250m , the facility could supply 140 million litres of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .
this means taking action to reduce and manage demand instead of simply trying to increase the supply of water .
the Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) , the defining piece of legislation on water in Europe , obliges Member States to use pricing ( charging money ) for water @-@ related services as an effective tool for promoting water conservation .
looking ahead shows that 50 % of the Mediterranean coastline is built on .
coastal areas in the North and West of Europe , where increased flooding is expected , are also being rapidly developed . the integration of adaptation into key EU policies has been limited .
EEA studies focusing on land cover show that coastal areas are often where most building is going on .
the killer slug , known scientifically as Arion lusitanicus , is also called the ' Spanish slug ' because it is native to the Iberian peninsula .
the slug is hermaphrodite and can spread very quickly .
the killer slug started to spread around Europe about 30 years ago , travelling as eggs in the soil of potted plants .
alien weeds reduce European agricultural yields and Dutch elm disease - caused by an introduced fungus - has devastated elm trees in the forests of central Europe .
others , called ' invasive alien species ' create serious problems as pest species to gardening , agriculture , forestry as vectors of diseases or by damaging constructions such as buildings and dams .
invasive alien species also change the ecosystems they live in and impact on the other species in those ecosystems .
biodiversity - the wider context ecosystems and existing native plant and animal species . the problem of invasive species is expected to worsen in the coming century through climate change , increasing trade and tourism .
it supports many basic services that we depend on such as the water we drink and the air we breathe .
currently , biodiversity is vanishing at an alarming rate mainly because of how we misuse nature to sustain production , consumption and trade in the globalized economy we live in .
as the world 's population is forecast to grow from 6.7 billion people today to nine billion in 2050 , it is expected that the impacts on biodiversity from the current main threats will grow and losses increase .
without biodiversity we would not be able to survive . as such it can be seen as an insurance policy provided to us by the planet .
invasive alien species are considered by many conservationists to be the second greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide .
IAS and Europe - increasing impacts contact can result in strong dermatitis .
today , the giant hogweed is most likely beyond eradication in Europe while early actions ( up to the 1950s ) probably would have had better prospects .
as a result , a first step in developing control and management measures , is to identify the most offensive species so that efforts are directed towards these .
it is also poisonous and direct skin
the EU also finances studies of these species within the ' programme for research and technological development ' .The problem of invasive alien species is not going away .
the story is set on 27 July 2008 when an air quality warning was issued in Brussels people 's health or the environment has still not been reached .
Particulate matter , a term used to describe a variety of tiny particles from sources such as vehicle exhausts and domestic stoves , affects the lungs .
Anna suffers from asthma and her doctor has warned of the dangers of air pollution , especially on hot summer days.Anna has heard about the London fogs of the 1950s that killed 2 000 people in one week .
motherhood and a recent asthma attack have quite rightly brought air pollution back to mind .
the air she and Johan breathe is much improved compared to the past , and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU 's environmental efforts .
each year , many more people die prematurely from air pollution in Europe than die in traffic accidents .
) , a volatile nitrogen compound , is one of them .
using maps , Anna can scan readings and forecasts for particulate matter , ozone , nitrogen dioxide , sulphur dioxide among many others . the data are relayed to the web from monitoring stations around the country .
out on the street , the full impact of the city 's traffic problems are easy to see - and smell .
exhaust emissions from cars in the centre of Brussels , and all major cities , irritate the respiratory tract and eyes and lungs .
Anna and Johan turn into their local train station and head for the countryside.Soon , Anna and Johan are entering a national park just outside Brussels .
a sign tells them that they are visiting a Natura 2000 site - one part of a European @-@ wide ecological network , set up to secure natural habitats and to maintain the range of plant and animal life .
the United Nations Convention on Long @-@ range transboundary Air Pollution ( LRTAP Convention ) agreed in 1979 , has been signed by 51 countries and forms the basis of the international fight to tackle air pollution .
one of the great success stories of air pollution policy over the last decades has been the massive reduction in emissions of sulphur dioxide .
suddenly Johan , who has been walking unsteadily loses his balance and falls into a clump of stinging nettles .
it occurs when too many chemical nutrients ( such as N ) are available to an ecosystem either on land or in water .
the fence protecting the area offers no defence - in fact building a greenhouse around the area would be the only way to protect it totally from airborne substances .
it has been estimated that the above package will cut the cost of meeting EU air pollution targets by EUR 8.5 billion per year .

the CAP currently has two ' pillars ' : production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives .
in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the EEA is also preparing an analysis of the CAP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsidy 's ' environmental ' spending .
• Pillar II recognises the central role of farming as a supplier of food and goods , as the cornerstone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager .
in the EU @-@ 15 , farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers , 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
many of our rarest species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional farming practices .
high nature value ( HNV ) farmland is land that is particularly rich in habitats and species of conservation concern .
most farmers have intensified production or abandoned farming altogether - trends that threaten natural habitats.An important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of wildlife friendly farming practices .
the Common Agriculture Policy ( CAP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @-@ war food shortages .
the subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
however , spending on AGRI @-@ environment schemes - the element most related to conservation - is not strongly connected to the amount of HNV farmland in the areas studied ( Figure 2 ) .
conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire CAP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts : the CAP is having an effect but it 's not effective enough .
Godwit chicks must eat about 20 000 insects in the first week of their life if they are to survive .
the single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .

a fisherman 's tale On the night of 6 October 1986 lobster fishermen from the small town of Gilleleje , north of Copenhagen , fishing the Kattegat Sea , found their nets crammed with Norway lobster .
hydrogen sulphide is toxic to most life forms , and it was probably a combination of hydrogen sulphide and lack of oxygen that killed the Norway lobsters in the Kattegat that night back in 1986 .
in almost every year when the cod stock has been assessed , the TAC has been set higher than the recommended level .
the Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
it has been estimated that an additional 30 % is landed illegally in this part of the Baltic Sea .
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Baltic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural , fisheries and regional policies . this plan , adopted in
quite a small reduction in the salinity is already tipping the balance and changing the composition of the Baltic habitat .
of the three major fished species , cod , herring , and sprat , cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae .
over time , there has been a steady increase in the area affected by hydrogen sulphide in the East and West Gotland basins , and the outer Gulf of Finland .
as a result , despite its depth , it remains well oxygenated , even during autumn .
management will need to accommodate these changes if the stock is to stay at a commercially relevant level Professor Brian MacKenzie , DTU @-@ Aqua , Technical University of Denmark
November 2007 , is an important basis for more effective implementation of EU policy in the area .
soils and plants are damage our soil and water resources .
knock @-@ on effects , so @-@ called ' indirect land @-@ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
however , risks within Europe could be lessened with the right choice of crops and management .
in this context , the EEA has been looking at how the impending bioenergy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
at the moment , renewables account for 6.7 % of European energy consumption .
two thirds of this comes from biomass.The European Commission is also keen to promote biofuels - fuel for transport - as diversification is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil .
the transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certified as sustainable .
the European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production .
promoting biofuels and other bioenergy in Europe inevitably triggers direct and indirect effects elsewhere .
to avoid the negative impacts of a switch to bioenergy described above , we need strong policies at international level to prevent land @-@ use changes adding to environmental problems in the pursuit of bioenergy .
in this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bioenergy sector .
this process harnesses the heat that is a by @-@ product of energy production .
however , a clear message still emerges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate mitigation , to prioritise bioenergy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
the factors driving the export and import of waste vary : availability of special treatment technology ; a shortage of materials ; differences in prices for disposal or recovery .
as long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain hazardous materials , it is deemed to be an acceptable trade .
however , the export of a TV that still works is perfectly acceptable .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the shipment of hazardous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment.Electronic waste , which is considered hazardous , is an important case .
waste of all descriptions is on the move .
the ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force globally .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .The EU 's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically ( the ' proximity principle ' ) .
driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts , size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shipped from the EU to other regions ( Figure 1 ) .
for over a decade , the cost of raw materials has been very high and this , in turn , has increased the value of secondary raw materials reclaimed through recycling .
the amount of plastic packaging recycled has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period .
in general , recycling therefore contributes substantially to the reduction of energy @-@ related emissions of cost and

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shipped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don 't know whether it is bad for the environment .
in 2005 20 % of the waste shipped was for disposal while 80 % was shipped for recovery operations .
the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally .
two new EU initiatives , in which the EEA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009 , are at the heart of this drive .
they are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( GMES ) and the Shared Environmental Information System ( SEIS ) .GMES will use satellites and sensors on the ground , floating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
traffic linked to extraction of Arctic resources on the fringes of the Arctic sea routes will most likely grow first .
