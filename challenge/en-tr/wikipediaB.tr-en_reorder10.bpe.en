because of this , up and down quar@@ ks are generally stable and the most common in the uni@@ verse , whereas st@@ range , char@@ m , bottom , and top quar@@ ks can only be produced in high energy col@@ lis@@ ions ( such as those involving cos@@ m@@ ic r@@ ays and in parti@@ cle acceler@@ ators ) .
for example , the Had@@ ron constitu@@ ents of at@@ om@@ ic N@@ uc@@ le@@ i , neutr@@ ons and pro@@ t@@ ons , have charges of 0 and + 1 respectively ; the neut@@ ron is composed of two down quar@@ ks and one up quar@@ k , and the pro@@ ton of two up quar@@ ks and one down quar@@ k .
while g@@ lu@@ ons are inher@@ ently mas@@ s@@ less , they poss@@ ess energy - more specifically , qu@@ ant@@ um ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics binding energy ( Q@@ CB@@ E ) - and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the Had@@ ron ( see mass in special rela@@ tivity ) .
when a g@@ lu@@ on is transferred between quar@@ ks , a col@@ or change occur@@ s in both ; for example , if a red quar@@ k em@@ its a red @@@ -@@ @ anti@@ green g@@ lu@@ on , it becomes green , and if a green quar@@ k absor@@ bs a red @@@ -@@ @ anti@@ green g@@ lu@@ on , it becomes red .
