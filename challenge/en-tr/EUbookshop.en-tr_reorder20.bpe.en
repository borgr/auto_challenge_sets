in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise defin@@ ition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
32 receiving such treatment stabil@@ ised or decreased (
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78

reports about ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic health problems requiring medical interven@@ tions relating to the use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces by young people .

Netherlands ( 16@@ 7 ) . the average p@@ urity of heroin products has been f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ating in most reporting countries ( 16@@ 8 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high pro@@ portion of sti@@ mul@@ ant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
41 % of a samp@@ le of 9@@ 64 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and excep@@ tionally high in another ( Ko@@ h@@ t@@ la @@@ -@@ @ J@@ ä@@ r@@ ve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
in Finland , hep@@ ati@@ tis B noti@@ fic@@ ations among I@@ D@@ U@@ s have fallen ste@@ ep@@ ly in recent years , possibly as a result of vacc@@ ination programmes and a comprehensive ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange system .
the purchase of sy@@ r@@ inges through pharmac@@ ies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , and the potential to explo@@ it this contact point as a con@@ du@@ it to other services clearly exists .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .
although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
taking pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed scientific public@@ ations as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such public@@ ations during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reve@@ als a pat@@ tern of them@@ atic research priorities that var@@ ies between countries .
EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using can@@ na@@ bis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
in recent school surveys , increases in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of ec@@ st@@ asy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a pro@@ gressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
figure 10 : number of op@@ i@@ oid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be home@@ less .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initi@@ ation of op@@ i@@ oid use before the age of 20 ; first use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids after the age of 25 was very un@@ common ( 13@@ 3 ) .
in Europe , most op@@ i@@ oid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substan@@ ces are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , or other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and , in some countries , cocaine .
figure 13 : overall trend in ac@@ ute drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths , 1996 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 for all M@@ ember States with available data account for a decreas@@ ing pro@@ portion of over@@ dos@@ es ( 170 ) .
a collabor@@ ative study that started within an E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA project found that op@@ i@@ oid users recru@@ ited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study on the effectiveness of treat@@ ments for heroin addi@@ ction , which will examine the association between re@@ tention in treatment and mortality , is currently under@@ way in Italy ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
in addition to public@@ ations speci@@ alising in illi@@ cit drugs and addi@@ ction , articles on illi@@ cit drug use are also published in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als from a wide array of discipl@@ ines and in professional magaz@@ ines .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe sub@@ stitution treatment and ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange programmes ( N@@ SP@@ s ) , which target over@@ d@@ ose deaths and the spread of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases .
in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 1 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 2 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 3 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 4 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 5 and S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 6 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
however , there are still differences between countries in the meth@@ od@@ ology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
esti@@ m@@ ating intensive and long @@@ -@@ @ term pat@@ ter@@ ns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , can@@ na@@ bis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ag@@ eing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
countries with sufficient data on last year pre@@ val@@ ence of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use among the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .

however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .

Spain reports the highest propor@@ tions among all clients ( 45 % ) and new clients ( 60 % ) , followed by the Netherlands ( 32 % and 29 % ) and Italy ( 23 % and 26 % ) .
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
in@@ j@@ ecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis ) or dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
treatment reports also suggest that among op@@ i@@ oid users , the popularity of in@@ j@@ ecting may v@@ ary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among new op@@ i@@ oid clients ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 9 % to 47.@@ 2 % .
in France , for example , a decrease in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initi@@ ation of heroin use has become increasingly
access to ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and coun@@ selling for inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases by 16 countries and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
population mortality rates due to dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced death v@@ ary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 13 ) .
drug users are informed about over@@ d@@ ose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abst@@ in@@ ence , the effects and risks of pol@@ y@@ drug use , in particular con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .

in the 20@@ 20@@ s , the estimated increase in heat @@@ -@@ @ related mortality resulting from projected climate change could exceed 25 000 per year , mainly in central and southern European regions ( 69 ) .
at the same time what happens in the Ar@@ c@@ tic also influ@@ ences Europe 's environment because the Ar@@ c@@ tic plays a key role , for example , in the context of climate change and related sea @@@ -@@ @ level rise projections .
for example , combin@@ ing climate change m@@ iti@@ gation and air pollution ab@@ ate@@ ment legislation could deliver benefits in the order of EU@@ R 10 billion per year through reductions in damage to public health and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems ( A ) ( 11 ) .
) The hot summer of 2003 in Europe , for example , has been estimated to have led to EU@@ R 10 billion of economic losses to far@@ ming , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and forest@@ ry from the combined effects of drought , heat stress and fire .
reducing regional dis@@ par@@ ities , the main goal of the European Union 's co@@ hesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � E@@ R ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Co@@ hesion Report , February 2004 ) .
loss of semin@@ atural veget@@ ations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . although many case studies exist ( see for example Ve@@ en and S@@ effer , 1999 ) , no reliable pan@@ European trend data are currently available for plant communities and ha@@ bit@@ ats .
the Environmental D@@ ata Cent@@ res include climate change , water , air , bio@@ diversity , and land use ( managed by E@@ EA ) , forests and so@@ ils ( managed by J@@ RC ) and waste , natural resources and products ( managed by Eurostat ) .
overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce green@@ house gas emissions in Europe , dec@@ ou@@ pling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Si@@ x@@ th Environment Action Programme .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desper@@ ate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s for st@@ oring water , water transfer and de@@ sal@@ ination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
a sign tells them that they are visiting a N@@ atur@@ a 2000 site - one part of a European @@@ -@@ @ wide ecological network , set up to secure natural ha@@ bit@@ ats and to maintain the range of plant and animal life .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
