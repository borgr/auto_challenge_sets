a strong pass@@ word uses a combination of up@@ per and low@@ er@@ case letters , special charac@@ ters , and numbers . it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t contain personal info like your address , birthday , or family names .
a strong P@@ I@@ N does not contain personal info , such as your date of birth or address . it should be a number only you know and can '@@ t be easily gu@@ essed .
because your date of birth is easy to find in public records , it 's best to avoid using it in pass@@ words and P@@ IN@@ s . people who know your birthday could also very easily gu@@ ess your P@@ I@@ N .
create a { -@@ brand @@@ -@@ @ f@@ x@@ a } to monitor your em@@ ail for ongoing breaches . once you 've ver@@ ified your em@@ ail , you 'll also receive a full report of past breaches , including sensitive breaches .
cyber criminals could find your pass@@ word on the dark web and use it to lo@@ g in to your other accounts . the best way to protect your accounts is to use unique pass@@ words for each one .
data breaches are on the rise . if your personal info appears in a new data breach , { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name } sends you an alert - so you can take action and protect your accounts .
data breaches can affect anyone . spread the word so your friends and family can check to see if their online accounts are safe .
D@@ on '@@ t hand out personal data if you don '@@ t have to . if you are asked to enter or give out your em@@ ail address , Z@@ IP code , or phone number , you can say no .
even for old accounts , it 's important to up@@ date your pass@@ word .

have your accounts been le@@ aked or stolen in a data breach ? find out at { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name } . search our database and sign up for al@@ er@@ ts .
here 's what 's changed since you signed up for { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name } , the service that monitors known data breaches for your personal info . we 're linking it to Fi@@ re@@ fo@@ x accounts .
if you use { -@@ brand @@@ -@@ @ name } , you 'll receive a noti@@ fication if you visit a site that 's been b@@ reached . find out right away if you were part of that breach and what you can do about it .
I just found out I 'm in a data breach . what do I do next ?
it can sometimes take months or years for cre@@ denti@@ als ex@@ posed in a data breach to appear on the dark web . breaches get added to our database as soon as they have been discovered and ver@@ ified .
look out for st@@ range charges on your credit card . you may want to request a new card with a new number from your credit card issu@@ er .
make this pass@@ word unique and different from any others you use . a good strategy to follow is to comb@@ ine two or more un@@ related words to create an entire pas@@ sp@@ h@@ r@@ ase .
on { $ b@@ reac@@ h@@ D@@ ate } , { $ b@@ reac@@ h@@ Tit@@ le } suffered a breach . once the breach was discovered and ver@@ ified it was added to our database on { $ ad@@ de@@ d@@ D@@ ate } .
on { $ b@@ reac@@ h@@ D@@ ate } , { $ b@@ reac@@ h@@ Tit@@ le } was b@@ reached . once the breach was discovered and ver@@ ified , it was added to our database on { $ ad@@ de@@ d@@ D@@ ate } .
pass@@ words are so valuable , that thousands of them are stolen every day and tra@@ ded or sold on the black market . stronger pass@@ words protect your accounts and all the personal information that resi@@ des inside them .
find out what hackers already know about you , and learn how to stay a step ahead of them . { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name @@@ -@@ @ now@@ rap } arms you with tools to keep your personal information safe .

put your L@@ O@@ G@@ I@@ N details in a secure place only you can access , such as a pass@@ word manager . this also makes it easy to keep track of all your different pass@@ words .
search for your em@@ ail address in public data breaches going back to 2007 . this basic search will sur@@ face most data breaches , but not ones that contain sensitive personal information .
see if you 've been involved in a data breach .
see if you 've been part of a data breach .
see if you 've been part of a data breach .
< sp@@ an > feels good , right ? < / sp@@ an > If you want to keep going , this is a good time to up@@ date other log@@ ins with stronger pass@@ words .
< sp@@ an > On@@ ce you 've taken the steps you can to address this breach < / sp@@ an > , you can mark it as resolved . you can still access details about the breach from your d@@ ash@@ board at any time .
this will remove your em@@ ail from the { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name @@@ -@@ @ now@@ rap } list and you will no longer receive al@@ er@@ ts when new breaches are announced .
try to avoid giving out your phone number when signing up for new accounts or services . if a phone number is@@ n '@@ t required , don '@@ t enter it .
turn off { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name } al@@ er@@ ts . your { -@@ brand @@@ -@@ @ f@@ x@@ a } will remain active , and you may receive other account @@@ -@@ @ related communications .
did the add @@@ -@@ @ on work as you expected it to ?
use unique , strong pass@@ words for every account . if one pass@@ word gets ex@@ posed in a data breach , you 'll only need to up@@ date that one L@@ O@@ G@@ I@@ N .
using addresses or the street where you grew up weak@@ en your pass@@ words . since it 's easy to find this info publicly , it makes these pass@@ words easy to gu@@ ess .
website data breaches are on the rise . as soon as a new breach gets added to our database , { -@@ product @@@ -@@ @ name @@@ -@@ @ now@@ rap } sends you an alert - so you can take action and protect your account .
