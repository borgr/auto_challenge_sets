Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations are a set of partial differ@@ ential equ@@ ations that , together with the Lor@@ ent@@ z force law , form the foundation of classical elec@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ics , classical op@@ tics , and electric cir@@ cu@@ its .
the term " Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations " is often used for other forms of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations .
other units com@@ mon@@ ly used are G@@ aus@@ sian units based on the c@@ gs system , Lor@@ ent@@ z @@@ -@@ @ He@@ avis@@ ide units ( used mainly in parti@@ cle physi@@ cs ) , and Plan@@ ck units ( used in the@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ cs ) .
this dynam@@ ically indu@@ ced electric field has closed field lines just as the mag@@ ne@@ tic field , if not super@@ posed by a st@@ atic ( charge indu@@ ced ) electric field .
this aspect of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic indu@@ ction is the operating principle behind many electric gener@@ ators : for example , a rotating bar mag@@ net creates a changing mag@@ ne@@ tic field , which in turn gener@@ ates an electric field in a nearby w@@ ire .
it is sometimes called the general form of Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations or " Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations in a vac@@ u@@ um . "
the direct space @@@ -@@ @ time formu@@ lations make manif@@ est that the Max@@ well equ@@ ations are rela@@ tivis@@ tically inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant ( in fact studying the hidden sym@@ me@@ try of the v@@ ec@@ tor cal@@ cul@@ us formu@@ lation was a major source of in@@ spir@@ ation for rela@@ tivity theory ) .

it is difficult to give a comprehensive defin@@ ition of energy because of its many forms , but one common defin@@ ition is that it is the ability of a system to perform work .
an example is mechan@@ ical energy which is the sum of ( usually mac@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ) kin@@ etic and potential energy in a system .
G@@ ust@@ ave @@@ -@@ @ Gaspar@@ d Cor@@ i@@ ol@@ is described " kin@@ etic energy " in 18@@ 29 in its modern sense , and in 18@@ 53 , William Ran@@ k@@ ine co@@ ined the term " potential energy . "
it was argued for some years whether heat was a physical sub@@ stance , dubbed the cal@@ oric , or mer@@ ely a physical quanti@@ ty , such as momentum .
= = = Ch@@ em@@ istry = = = In the context of chem@@ istry , energy is an attri@@ bute of a sub@@ stance as a consequence of its at@@ om@@ ic , mo@@ lec@@ ular or ag@@ gre@@ gate structure .
= = = Bi@@ ology = = = In bi@@ ology , energy is an attri@@ bute of all biological systems from the Bi@@ os@@ phere to the smal@@ lest living organ@@ ism .
in growing organis@@ ms the energy that is conver@@ ted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organ@@ ism tis@@ sue to be highly ordered with regard to the mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les it is built from .
simp@@ ler organis@@ ms can achieve higher energy effici@@ encies than more complex ones , but the complex organis@@ ms can occup@@ y ecological nic@@ hes that are not available to their simp@@ ler bre@@ th@@ ren .
there are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be conver@@ ted into other forms of energy via work , and heat as described by Car@@ not 's the@@ o@@ rem and the second law of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics .
similarly , in the case of a chemical explosion , chemical potential energy is transformed to kin@@ etic energy and thermal energy in a very short time .
at its lowest point the kin@@ etic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy .
in different the@@ ore@@ tical fra@@ me@@ works , similar formu@@ las were der@@ ived by J@@ . J@@ . Thom@@ son ( 18@@ 81 ) , Hen@@ ri Po@@ inc@@ ar@@ é ( 19@@ 00 ) , Fri@@ ed@@ rich Has@@ en@@ ö@@ h@@ r@@ l ( 19@@ 04 ) and others ( see Mas@@ s @@@ -@@ @ energy equi@@ val@@ ence # History for further information ) .
for example , con@@ version of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pen@@ dul@@ um system described above .
in this case , energy can only be ex@@ changed between adj@@ ac@@ ent regions of space , and all observers agree as to the vol@@ u@@ metric den@@ s@@ ity of energy in any given space .
this ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal ent@@ ang@@ lement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any defin@@ ite time inter@@ val .
the uncertainty principle should not be conf@@ used with energy conserv@@ ation - rather it provides ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal limits to which energy can in principle be defined and meas@@ ured .
each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy , and all types of potential energy ( like all other types of energy ) appears as system mass , wh@@ en@@ ever present .
= = = Open systems = = = There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy .
it is related to the potential energy , e@@ .@@ g@@ . , mo@@ lec@@ ular structure , cr@@ y@@ st@@ al structure , and other geo@@ metric aspects , as well as the motion of the parti@@ c@@ les , in form of kin@@ etic energy .
the general formu@@ lation of the first law ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , conserv@@ ation of energy ) is valid even in situations in which the system is not h@@ omo@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
= = = E@@ qu@@ i@@ partition of energy = = = The energy of a mechan@@ ical harmonic os@@ cil@@ la@@ tor ( a mass on a spring ) is alternati@@ vely kin@@ etic and potential .
at two points in the os@@ cil@@ lation cycle it is entirely kin@@ etic , and alternati@@ vely at two other points it is entirely potential .

according to another study , when meas@@ ured in a particular solution , the DNA chain meas@@ ured 22 to 26 å@@ n@@ g@@ str@@ ö@@ ms wide ( 2.2 to 2.@@ 6 nano@@ metres ) , and one n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de unit meas@@ ured 3.3 Å ( 0.@@ 33 N@@ M ) long .
for instance , the largest human ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome number 1 , consists of approximately 220 million base p@@ airs and is 85 M@@ M long .
a n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ base linked to a sugar is called a n@@ uc@@ le@@ os@@ ide and a base linked to a sugar and one or more ph@@ os@@ ph@@ ate groups is called a n@@ uc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de .
the two str@@ ands of DNA in a double hel@@ i@@ x can therefore be pulled apart like a z@@ ip@@ per , either by a mechan@@ ical force or high temper@@ ature .
as a result of this comple@@ men@@ tar@@ ity , all the information in the double @@@ -@@ @ st@@ ran@@ ded sequ@@ ence of a DNA hel@@ i@@ x is du@@ p@@ lic@@ ated on each Str@@ and , which is vital in DNA rep@@ lic@@ ation .
indeed , this reversible and specific inter@@ action between comple@@ mentary base p@@ airs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organis@@ ms .
in the laboratory , the strength of this inter@@ action can be meas@@ ured by finding the temper@@ ature necessary to break the hydro@@ gen bonds , their mel@@ ting temper@@ ature ( also called " T@@ m " value ) .
when all the base p@@ airs in a DNA double hel@@ i@@ x mel@@ t , the str@@ ands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
in these cases , some DNA sequ@@ ences do double duty , en@@ co@@ ding one prote@@ in when read along one Str@@ and , and a second prote@@ in when read in the opposite direction along the other Str@@ and .
if the DNA is tw@@ isted in the direction of the hel@@ i@@ x , this is positive super@@ co@@ iling , and the bases are held more tigh@@ tly together .
the set of ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes in a cell makes up its gen@@ ome ; the human gen@@ ome has approximately 3 billion base p@@ airs of DNA arran@@ ged into 46 ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ omes .
the details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here we focus on the inter@@ actions between DNA and other mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les that mediate the function of the gen@@ ome .
the gen@@ etic information in a gen@@ ome is held within gen@@ es , and the complete set of this information in an organ@@ ism is called its gen@@ oty@@ pe .
a gen@@ e is a unit of her@@ edi@@ ty and is a region of DNA that influ@@ ences a particular character@@ istic in an organ@@ ism .
these sequ@@ ences are usually just mo@@ lec@@ ular fos@@ sil@@ s , although they can occasi@@ onally serve as raw gen@@ etic material for the creation of new gen@@ es through the process of gen@@ e du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation and di@@ ver@@ gence .
within a gen@@ e , the sequ@@ ence of bases along a DNA Str@@ and defin@@ es a mes@@ sen@@ ger R@@ NA sequ@@ ence , which then defin@@ es one or more prote@@ in sequ@@ ences .
as DNA pol@@ y@@ mer@@ ases can only extend a DNA Str@@ and in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction , different mechanisms are used to cop@@ y the anti@@ parallel str@@ ands of the double hel@@ i@@ x .
in this way , the base on the old Str@@ and dic@@ ta@@ tes which base appears on the new Str@@ and , and the cell ends up with a perfect cop@@ y of its DNA .

in physi@@ cs , classical mechan@@ ics and qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics are the two major sub @@@ -@@ @ fields of mechan@@ ics .
the study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one , making classical mechan@@ ics one of the oldest and largest subjects in science , engineering and technology .
the initial stage in the development of classical mechan@@ ics is often referred to as New@@ ton@@ ian mechan@@ ics , and is associated with the physical concep@@ ts employed by and the ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal methods in@@ ven@@ ted by New@@ ton himself , in parallel with Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z , and others .

bac@@ ter@@ ial met@@ abol@@ ism is classified into nut@@ ri@@ tional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of car@@ bon , and the elec@@ tr@@ on donors used for growth .
car@@ bon met@@ abol@@ ism in bac@@ ter@@ ia is either " het@@ er@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic , " where organ@@ ic car@@ bon compo@@ unds are used as car@@ bon sources , or " aut@@ ot@@ rop@@ hic , " meaning that cel@@ lular car@@ bon is obtained by fixing car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide .
in " ana@@ ero@@ bic organis@@ ms " other in@@ organ@@ ic compo@@ unds , such as nit@@ rate , sul@@ fate or car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide are used as elec@@ tr@@ on accep@@ tors .
Fer@@ ment@@ ation is possible , because the energy content of the sub@@ stra@@ tes is higher than that of the products , which allows the organis@@ ms to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise ATP and drive their met@@ abol@@ ism .
Sp@@ i@@ ro@@ chae@@ tes of the gen@@ us " Bor@@ reli@@ a " are a no@@ table exception to this arrangement , with bac@@ ter@@ ia such as " Bor@@ reli@@ a bur@@ g@@ dor@@ feri , " the cause of Ly@@ me disease , containing a single lin@@ e@@ ar ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .

that is , New@@ ton proposed that light cons@@ isted of small parti@@ c@@ les , with which he could easily explain the phenomenon of ref@@ le@@ ction .
in the late 19th century , James cler@@ k Max@@ well explained light as the propag@@ ation of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic waves according to the Max@@ well equ@@ ations .
it was E@@ in@@ stein who later proposed that it is the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation itself that is quanti@@ z@@ ed , and not the energy of radi@@ ating At@@ oms .
according to the classical theory of light and matter , the strength or am@@ pl@@ itu@@ de of a light wave was in pro@@ portion to its bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current .
for example , pho@@ t@@ ons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an elec@@ tr@@ on from the metal , but pho@@ t@@ ons of red light did not .

General rela@@ tivity , also known as the general theory of rela@@ tivity , is the geo@@ metric theory of gra@@ v@@ itation published by Albert E@@ in@@ stein in 19@@ 15 and the current descri@@ ption of gra@@ v@@ itation in modern physi@@ cs .
after numerous de@@ tour@@ s and false starts , his work culmin@@ ated in the presentation to the Pr@@ us@@ sian Academy of Science in November 19@@ 15 of what are now known as the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations .
but as early as 19@@ 16 , the astro@@ physi@@ cist Kar@@ l Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild found the first non @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ vi@@ al exact solution to the E@@ in@@ stein field equ@@ ations , the so @@@ -@@ @ called Schwar@@ z@@ sch@@ ild metric .
this suggests the defin@@ ition of a new class of iner@@ tial motion , name@@ ly that of objects in free fall under the influence of gra@@ vity .
in the language of sym@@ me@@ try : where gra@@ vity can be neglec@@ ted , physi@@ cs is Lor@@ ent@@ z inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant as in special rela@@ tivity rather than Gal@@ il@@ ei inv@@ ar@@ i@@ ant as in classical mechan@@ ics .
they are defined by the set of light con@@ es ( see the image on the left ) .
for weak gra@@ vit@@ ational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predic@@ tions conver@@ ge on those of New@@ ton 's law of universal gra@@ v@@ itation .
in the field of num@@ er@@ ical rela@@ tivity , powerful computers are employed to si@@ mu@@ late the geo@@ me@@ try of sp@@ ac@@ etime and to solve E@@ in@@ stein 's equ@@ ations for interesting situations such as two col@@ li@@ ding black ho@@ les .
the latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geo@@ me@@ try of a sp@@ ac@@ etime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light .
the expansion involves a series of terms ; the first terms represent New@@ ton@@ ian gra@@ vity , whereas the later terms represent ever smaller correc@@ tions to New@@ ton 's theory due to general rela@@ tivity .
light sent down into a gra@@ vity well is blu@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . , clim@@ bing out of the gra@@ vity well ) is red@@ shif@@ ted ; collec@@ tively , these two effects are known as the gra@@ vit@@ ational frequ@@ ency shift .
however , at the current level of accur@@ acy , these ob@@ serv@@ ations can@@ not distingu@@ ish between general rela@@ tivity and other the@@ ories in which the equi@@ val@@ ence principle is valid .
this and related predic@@ tions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light @@@ -@@ @ like or n@@ ul@@ l Geo@@ de@@ sic - a general@@ ization of the stra@@ ight lines along which light travels in classical physi@@ cs .
within the So@@ lar System or for ordinary double stars , the effect is too small to be ob@@ serv@@ able .
the first ob@@ servation of a decrease in or@@ bi@@ tal period due to the emis@@ sion of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves was made by H@@ ul@@ se and Tay@@ lor , using the bin@@ ary pul@@ sar P@@ SR@@ 19@@ 13 + 16 they had discovered in 1974 .
if a massive object is situated between the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative dist@@ ances , the as@@ tron@@ o@@ mer will see multiple dist@@ or@@ ted images of the target .
several land @@@ -@@ @ based gra@@ vit@@ ational wave detec@@ tors are currently in operation , most notably the inter@@ fer@@ o@@ metric detec@@ tors ge@@ o 600 , L@@ IG@@ O ( two detec@@ tors ) , TA@@ MA 300 and V@@ IR@@ G@@ O .
General rela@@ tivity plays a central role in model@@ ling all these phenom@@ ena , and ob@@ serv@@ ations provide strong evidence for the existence of black ho@@ les with the properties predicted by the theory .
astronom@@ ical ob@@ serv@@ ations of the cos@@ m@@ ological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the uni@@ verse to be estimated , although the nature of that matter remains my@@ ster@@ ious in part .
an even larger question is the physi@@ cs of the ear@@ li@@ est uni@@ verse , prior to the inf@@ la@@ tionary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big ban@@ g sing@@ ular@@ ity .
even more remar@@ kab@@ ly , there is a general set of laws known as black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics , which is anal@@ og@@ ous to the laws of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics .
for instance , by the second law of black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics , the area of the event hor@@ iz@@ on of a general black hol@@ e will never decrease with time , anal@@ og@@ ous to the ent@@ rop@@ y of a ther@@ mo@@ dynamic system .
there is strong evidence that the laws of black hol@@ e mechan@@ ics are , in fact , a sub@@ set of the laws of ther@@ mo@@ dynam@@ ics , and that the black hol@@ e area is propor@@ tional to its ent@@ rop@@ y .
even in flat Min@@ ko@@ w@@ ski space , when described by an accelerated observer ( R@@ in@@ d@@ ler space ) , there will be hor@@ iz@@ ons associated with a semi @@@ -@@ @ classical radi@@ ation known as Un@@ ru@@ h radi@@ ation .
the cos@@ m@@ ic censorship hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is states that all realistic future sing@@ ular@@ ities ( no perfect sym@@ me@@ tries , matter with realistic properties ) are saf@@ ely hidden away behind a hor@@ iz@@ on , and thus in@@ visible to all distant observers .
in E@@ in@@ stein 's theory , it turns out to be impossible to find a general defin@@ ition for a seem@@ ingly simple property such as a system 's total mass ( or energy ) .
the main reason is that the gra@@ vit@@ ational field - like any physical field - must be as@@ cri@@ bed a certain energy , but that it proves to be fundament@@ ally impossible to lo@@ cal@@ ize that energy .
in order to describe situations in which gra@@ vity is strong enough to influence ( qu@@ ant@@ um ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quanti@@ z@@ ation itself , physi@@ c@@ ists have formu@@ lated qu@@ ant@@ um field the@@ ories in cur@@ ved sp@@ ac@@ etime .
at low ener@@ gies , this approach proves successful , in that it results in an acceptable effective ( qu@@ ant@@ um ) field theory of gra@@ vity .
M@@ ath@@ em@@ ati@@ cal rela@@ tiv@@ ists seek to understand the nature of sing@@ ular@@ ities and the fundamental properties of E@@ in@@ stein 's equ@@ ations , and increasingly powerful computer si@@ mu@@ lations ( such as those describing mer@@ ging black ho@@ les ) are run .

since the rise of experim@@ ental psych@@ ology in the 19th Cen@@ tur@@ y , psych@@ ology 's understanding of perception has pro@@ g@@ ressed by combin@@ ing a variety of techniques .
Per@@ cep@@ tual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sen@@ sory qu@@ alities such as sound , s@@ me@@ ll or col@@ or exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perce@@ i@@ ver .
there is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is testing , anal@@ og@@ ous to science , or whether realistic sen@@ sory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary .
the percep@@ tual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable , even though the sen@@ sory information is typically in@@ complete and rapidly var@@ ying .
for example , if some material is s@@ cr@@ at@@ ched by ap@@ ati@@ te but not by f@@ lu@@ or@@ ite , its hard@@ ness on the Mo@@ h@@ s scale would fall between 4 and 5 .
the alk@@ al@@ ine ear@@ th met@@ als are ber@@ yl@@ li@@ um ( Be ) , mag@@ nes@@ ium ( M@@ G ) , cal@@ ci@@ um ( C@@ a ) , stron@@ ti@@ um ( S@@ r ) , bar@@ ium ( BA ) , and radi@@ um ( R@@ a ) .
however , the interpre@@ tations are typically ambi@@ gu@@ ous as the spec@@ tra can fit more than one model of the sur@@ face composition and depend on the unknown parti@@ cle size .
for reference , two mo@@ ons : Tr@@ it@@ on and Pho@@ ebe , the cent@@ au@@ r P@@ hol@@ us and the plan@@ et Mar@@ s are plot@@ ted ( yel@@ low la@@ bel@@ s , size not to scale ) .
for a known al@@ bed@@ o , it is possible to estimate the sur@@ face temper@@ ature , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly the inten@@ s@@ ity of heat radi@@ ation .
further , if the size of the object is known , it is possible to predict both the amount of visible light and em@@ it@@ ted heat radi@@ ation reaching Earth .
Rad@@ on has no stable iso@@ top@@ es ; its longest @@@ -@@ @ lived iso@@ top@@ e , 2@@ 2@@ 2@@ R@@ n , has a half @@@ -@@ @ life of 3.8 days and dec@@ ays to form hel@@ ium and pol@@ on@@ ium , which ultimately dec@@ ays to lead .
to do this , the near@@ est no@@ ble gas that prece@@ des the element in question is written first , and then the elec@@ tr@@ on config@@ ur@@ ation is continued from that point forward .
compo@@ unds of x@@ enon bound to bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen , bro@@ mine , i@@ od@@ ine , ber@@ yl@@ li@@ um , sul@@ ph@@ ur , ti@@ tan@@ ium , cop@@ per , and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in no@@ ble gas mat@@ ri@@ ces , or in su@@ person@@ ic no@@ ble gas j@@ ets .
however , due to the high radio@@ activity and short half @@@ -@@ @ life of rad@@ on iso@@ top@@ es , only a few f@@ lu@@ or@@ ides and ox@@ ides of rad@@ on have been formed in practice .
similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compo@@ unds of Arg@@ on in 2000 , such as Arg@@ on f@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( H@@ Ar@@ F ) , and some bound to the late transition met@@ als cop@@ per , silver , and gold .
because it is composed of the two most ab@@ und@@ ant elements in the uni@@ verse , hydro@@ gen and hel@@ ium , it is believed to occur n@@ atur@@ ally in the inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar medium , although it has not been detec@@ ted yet .
the essential condition for their formation is that the guest ( no@@ ble gas ) At@@ oms must be of appropriate size to fit in the c@@ av@@ ities of the host cr@@ y@@ st@@ al lat@@ tice .
these compo@@ unds have found use in the study of the structure and reac@@ tivity of ful@@ ler@@ en@@ es by means of the nuclear mag@@ ne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance of the no@@ ble gas atom .
for example , bon@@ ding in is described by a set of three mo@@ lec@@ ular or@@ bit@@ als ( M@@ Os ) der@@ ived from P @@@ -@@ @ or@@ bit@@ als on each atom .
the reason is that there is no pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al hel@@ ium in the atmosphere ; due to the small mass of the atom , hel@@ ium can@@ not be re@@ tained by the Earth 's gra@@ vit@@ ational field .
due to its high radio@@ activity , rad@@ on presents a significant health haz@@ ard ; it is implic@@ ated in an estimated 2@@ 1,000 lun@@ g cancer deaths per year in the United States alone .
H@@ eli@@ um is used as a component of bre@@ a@@ thing gas@@ es to replace nit@@ ro@@ gen , due its low sol@@ u@@ bility in f@@ lu@@ ids , especially in li@@ pi@@ ds .
H@@ eli@@ um is used as the carrier medium in gas ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ o@@ graphy , as a fil@@ ler gas for ther@@ mo@@ meters , and in devices for measuring radi@@ ation , such as the Ge@@ ig@@ er counter and the bu@@ b@@ ble chamber .
the exc@@ im@@ ers used for las@@ ers may be no@@ ble gas di@@ mers such as Ar@@ 2 , Kr@@ 2 or X@@ e@@ 2 , or more com@@ mon@@ ly , the no@@ ble gas is combined with a hal@@ og@@ en in exc@@ im@@ ers such as Ar@@ F , Kr@@ F , X@@ e@@ F , or X@@ e@@ C@@ l .
these las@@ ers produce ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light which , due to its short w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th ( 19@@ 3 N@@ M for Ar@@ F and 2@@ 48 N@@ M for Kr@@ F ) , allows for high @@@ -@@ @ prec@@ ision im@@ aging .

the behaviour of matter at the mo@@ lec@@ ular scale including its den@@ s@@ ity is determined by the balance between the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the elec@@ tr@@ ons themselves .
mar@@ in@@ ers had noticed that ligh@@ t@@ ning strikes had the ability to distur@@ b a comp@@ ass ne@@ ed@@ le , but the link between ligh@@ t@@ ning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Frank@@ lin 's proposed experim@@ ents in 17@@ 52 .
in classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism , the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field obe@@ ys a set of equ@@ ations known as Max@@ well 's equ@@ ations , and the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force is given by the Lor@@ ent@@ z force law .
one of the pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar@@ ities of classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism is that it is difficult to reconc@@ ile with classical mechan@@ ics , but it is compatible with special rela@@ tivity .
after important contributions of H@@ end@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z and Hen@@ ri Po@@ inc@@ ar@@ é , in 19@@ 05 , Albert E@@ in@@ stein solved the problem with the introduction of special rela@@ tivity , which replaces classical kin@@ em@@ atics with a new theory of kin@@ em@@ atics that is compatible with classical elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tism .
the inter@@ action between a moving charge and an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field is the source of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force , which is one of the four fundamental forces ( Se@@ e also : mag@@ ne@@ tic field ) .
when the net electric charge of an object is non @@@ -@@ @ zero and mo@@ tion@@ less , the phenomenon is known as st@@ atic electricity .
charge taken from one material is moved to the other material , leaving an opposite charge of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de behind .
in 18@@ 39 , Michael Far@@ aday showed that the apparent division between st@@ atic electricity , current electricity , and bio@@ electricity was incor@@ rec@@ t , and all were a consequence of the behavi@@ or of a single kind of electricity appe@@ aring in opposite polar@@ ities .
one of the fore@@ most experts on electricity in the 18th century was Benjamin Frank@@ lin , who argued in favour of a one @@@ -@@ @ f@@ lu@@ id theory of electricity .
Frank@@ lin imag@@ ined electricity as being a type of in@@ visible f@@ lu@@ id present in all matter ; for example , he believed that it was the glass in a L@@ ey@@ den j@@ ar that held the acc@@ um@@ ulated charge .
in contrast , electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object , which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge .
be@@ w@@ are that , in the common and important case of metal@@ lic wi@@ res , the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the dri@@ ft v@@ el@@ o@@ city of the actual charge carriers , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the elec@@ tr@@ ons .
he is remember@@ ed today largely for his book " De Mag@@ n@@ ete " ( 1@@ 600 ) , and is credi@@ ted as one of the origin@@ ators of the term " electricity . "
in his book , he also studied st@@ atic electricity using Am@@ ber ; Am@@ ber is called " elek@@ tr@@ on " in Greek , so G@@ il@@ bert decided to call its effect the " electric force . "
the first was repeated in three of his works - " In the Ad@@ van@@ cement of L@@ earning " ( 16@@ 05 ) , " Nov@@ um Organ@@ um " ( 16@@ 20 ) and " De Aug@@ men@@ tis " ( 16@@ 23 ) .

to explain why these stars ex@@ er@@ ted no net gra@@ vit@@ ational pull on the So@@ lar System , I@@ sa@@ ac New@@ ton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction , an idea prompted by the the@@ olo@@ gian Richard B@@ ent@@ ley .
his son John Her@@ sch@@ el repeated this study in the southern hem@@ is@@ phere and found a correspon@@ ding increase in the same direction .
in addition to his other accomplis@@ hments , William Her@@ sch@@ el is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not mer@@ ely lie along the same line of sight , but are also physical compan@@ ions that form bin@@ ary star systems .

however , since the lif@@ es@@ pan of such stars is greater than the current age of the uni@@ verse ( 13.@@ 8 billion years ) , no stars under about 0.@@ 85 are expected to have moved off the main sequ@@ ence .
older , population II stars have substan@@ tially less metal@@ lic@@ ity than the younger , population I stars due to the composition of the mo@@ lec@@ ular cl@@ ou@@ ds from which they formed .

if what remains after the ou@@ ter atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it sh@@ rin@@ ks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth , known as a white d@@ war@@ f .
the most massive stars last an average of a few million years , while stars of minimum mass ( red d@@ war@@ f@@ s ) bur@@ n their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years .

as he became the chairman , Sal@@ am sought to up@@ date the university curricul@@ um , making a course of qu@@ ant@@ um mechan@@ ics as a part of under@@ graduate course .
this was soon rever@@ ted by the Vice @@@ -@@ @ Chancellor , and Sal@@ am decided to te@@ ach an evening course in qu@@ ant@@ um Mec@@ han@@ ics outside the regular curricul@@ um .

as they pass through a hol@@ e in the pla@@ te , the polar@@ ity is swit@@ ched so that the pla@@ te now rep@@ els them and they are now accelerated by it towards the next pla@@ te .
as the parti@@ c@@ les approach the speed of light the swit@@ ching rate of the electric fields becomes so high that they operate at radio frequ@@ encies , and so micro@@ wave c@@ av@@ ities are used in higher energy machines instead of simple plates .
therefore parti@@ cle physi@@ c@@ ists do not generally think in terms of speed , but rather in terms of a parti@@ cle 's energy or momentum , usually meas@@ ured in elec@@ tr@@ on vol@@ ts ( e@@ V ) .
the parti@@ c@@ les are in@@ j@@ ected in the centre of the mag@@ net and are extr@@ acted at the ou@@ ter edge at their maximum energy .

in physi@@ cs , a force is said to do work if , when acting on a body , there is a dis@@ placement of the point of application in the direction of the force .
= = Un@@ its = = The SI unit of work is the jo@@ ule ( J ) , which is defined as the work expen@@ ded by a force of one new@@ ton through a distance of one metre .
the dimen@@ sion@@ ally equivalent new@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ metre ( N · m ) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work , but this can be conf@@ used with the unit new@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ metre , which is the meas@@ urement unit of tor@@ que .
due to work having the same physical dimension as heat , occasi@@ onally meas@@ urement units typically reserved for heat or energy content , such as ther@@ m , B@@ TU and Cal@@ or@@ ie , are u@@ tili@@ z@@ ed as a measuring unit .
if external forces are applied to the book so that it sli@@ des on the table , then the force ex@@ er@@ ted by the table constra@@ ins the book from moving down@@ wards .
the sum of these small amounts of work over the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the point yi@@ elds the work , : formula _ 7@@ where " C " is the traj@@ ec@@ tory from x ( t@@ 1 ) to x ( t@@ 2 ) .
if the force is always directed along this line , and the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of the force is " F , " then this integral simp@@ li@@ fies to : formula _ 8@@ where " s " is distance along the line .
if F is constant , in addition to being directed along the line , then the integral simp@@ li@@ fies further to : formula _ 9@@ where " s " is the distance travelled by the point along the line .
this calc@@ ulation can be general@@ ized for a constant force that is not directed along the line , followed by the parti@@ cle .
thus , no work can be performed by gra@@ vity on a plan@@ et with a cir@@ cular or@@ bit ( this is ideal , as all or@@ bi@@ ts are slightly el@@ li@@ p@@ tical ) .
this integral depends on the rot@@ ational traj@@ ec@@ tory " φ ( t ) , " and is therefore path @@@ -@@ @ dependent .
= = Wor@@ k and potential energy = = The scal@@ ar product of a force F and the v@@ el@@ o@@ city V of its point of application defin@@ es the power in@@ put to a system at an in@@ stan@@ t of time .
integration of this power over the traj@@ ec@@ tory of the point of application , " C " = x ( t ) , defin@@ es the work in@@ put to the system by the force .
it is conven@@ i@@ ent to imag@@ ine this gra@@ vit@@ ational force concentrated at the cen@@ ter of mass of the object .
in more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechan@@ ical device , the heat energy in a thermal system , or the electrical energy in an electrical device .
the work of the net force is calculated as the product of its mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de and the parti@@ cle dis@@ placement .
this can also be written as : formula _ 5@@ 4@@ This integral is compu@@ ted along the traj@@ ec@@ tory X ( t ) of the parti@@ cle and is therefore path dependent .

if the potential energy is set to zero at in@@ fin@@ ite distance from the at@@ om@@ ic n@@ uc@@ le@@ us or mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e , the usual convention , then bound elec@@ tr@@ on states have negative potential energy .

for a con@@ fined parti@@ cle such as an elec@@ tr@@ on in an atom , the wave function has the form of standing waves .
the no@@ tion of energy levels was proposed in 19@@ 13 by Danish physi@@ cist Ni@@ els Bo@@ h@@ r in the Bo@@ h@@ r theory of the atom .
the energy of its state is mainly determined by the elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic inter@@ action of the ( negative ) elec@@ tr@@ on with the ( positive ) n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
= = = = Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ elec@@ tr@@ on At@@ oms include elec@@ tro@@ st@@ atic inter@@ action of an elec@@ tr@@ on with other elec@@ tr@@ ons = = = = If there is more than one elec@@ tr@@ on around the atom , elec@@ tr@@ on @@@ -@@ @ elec@@ tr@@ on @@@ -@@ @ inter@@ actions raise the energy level .
: formula _ 3@@ In such cases , the or@@ bi@@ tal types ( determined by the az@@ im@@ u@@ thal qu@@ ant@@ um number ) as well as their levels within the mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e affect and therefore also affect the various at@@ om@@ ic elec@@ tr@@ on energy levels .
for filling an atom with elec@@ tr@@ ons in the ground state , the lowest energy levels are filled first and consistent with the Pa@@ uli exclu@@ sion principle , the Au@@ f@@ ba@@ u principle , and H@@ und 's rule .
a non @@@ -@@ @ bon@@ ding or@@ bi@@ tal in a mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is an or@@ bi@@ tal with elec@@ tr@@ ons in ou@@ ter shel@@ ls which do not participate in bon@@ ding and its energy level is the same as that of the constituent atom .
if an atom , Ion , or mo@@ le@@ cul@@ e is at the lowest possible energy level , it and its elec@@ tr@@ ons are said to be in the " ground state . "
an elec@@ tr@@ on far@@ ther from the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us has higher potential energy than an elec@@ tr@@ on closer to the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , thus it becomes less bound to the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , since its potential energy is negative and in@@ ver@@ sely dependent on its distance from the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us .
