God created the large sea cre@@ atures , and every living cre@@ ature that moves , with which the waters s@@ war@@ med , after their kind , and every w@@ ing@@ ed bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th . "
God b@@ les@@ sed them . God said to them , " Be fruit@@ ful , multi@@ ply , fill the ear@@ th , and sub@@ due it . have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the sky , and over every living thing that moves on the ear@@ th . "
God said , " be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , which is on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , which be@@ ars fruit yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed . it will be your food .
to every animal of the ear@@ th , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , in which there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for food " ; and it was so .
this is the history of the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens .
no plant of the field was yet in the ear@@ th , and no her@@ b of the field had yet sp@@ run@@ g up ; for Yah@@ we@@ h God had not caused it to rain on the ear@@ th . there was not a man to ti@@ ll the ground ,
out of the ground Yah@@ we@@ h God made every tree to grow that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the gar@@ den , and the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will su@@ rely die . "
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the gar@@ den , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a de@@ light to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desi@@ red to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
they heard the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day , and the man and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the gar@@ den .
by the swe@@ at of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are d@@ ust , and to d@@ ust you shall return . "
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed Cher@@ ub@@ s at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den , and the fla@@ me of a s@@ word which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
from now on , when you ti@@ ll the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . "
be@@ hold , you have driven me out this day from the sur@@ face of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . it will happen that who@@ ever finds me will kill me . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the sur@@ face of the ground ; man , along with animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sor@@ ry that I have made them . "
you shall make a ro@@ of in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cu@@ bit up@@ ward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h having the bre@@ ath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the ear@@ th will die .
but I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wi@@ ves with you .
of the birds after their kind , of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the ear@@ th for for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the sur@@ face of the ground . "
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , on the same day all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep were bur@@ st open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
in the same day No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
they , and every animal after its kind , all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
the flood was for@@ ty days on the ear@@ th . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the ear@@ th .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the sur@@ face of the ground , including man , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the ear@@ th . only No@@ ah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
the waters rece@@ ded continu@@ ally until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from the ear@@ th . No@@ ah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the sur@@ face of the ground was dri@@ ed .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all f@@ les@@ h , including birds , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply on the ear@@ th . "
the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you will be on every animal of the ear@@ th , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground te@@ em@@ s with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will su@@ rely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you : all f@@ les@@ h will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood , neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the ear@@ th . "
and I will remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which is between me and you and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h , and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all f@@ les@@ h .
the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w will be in the cl@@ oud . I will look at it , that I may remember the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between God and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h that is on the ear@@ th . "
S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it on both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , went in back@@ wards , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father . their faces were back@@ wards , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
Can@@ a@@ an became the father of S@@ id@@ on ( his fir@@ st@@ born ) , H@@ eth ,
they said , " C@@ ome , let 's build ourselves a city , and a to@@ wer whose top reaches to the sky , and let 's make ourselves a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad on the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " be@@ hold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be with@@ held from them , which they intend to do .
Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took wi@@ ves . the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai , and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an who was also the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , lot the son of Har@@ an , his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife . they went from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . they came to Har@@ an and lived there .
Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , lot his brother 's son , all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s whom they had gotten in Har@@ an , and they went to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
he left from there to the mountain on the east of Be@@ the@@ l , and pit@@ ched his tent , having Be@@ the@@ l on the west , and A@@ I on the east . there he built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h and called on the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
there was a fam@@ ine in the land . Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to live as a foreig@@ ner there , for the fam@@ ine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " Se@@ e now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
why did you say , ' S@@ he is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of lot 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
Is@@ n '@@ t the whole land before you ? ple@@ ase separate yo@@ ur@@ self from me . if you go to the left hand , then I will go to the right . or if you go to the right hand , then I will go to the left . "
that they made war with Ber@@ a , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha , king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
one who had escaped came and told Ab@@ ram , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w . now he lived by the o@@ aks of Mam@@ re , the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sh@@ col , and brother of An@@ er ; and these were allies of Ab@@ ram .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursu@@ ed them to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
the king of So@@ dom went out to meet him , after his return from the sla@@ ughter of Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer and the kings who were with him , at the val@@ ley of Sha@@ ve@@ h ( that is , the King 's Valley ) .
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have e@@ aten , and the portion of the men who went with me : An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re . let them take their portion . "
be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your he@@ ir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your he@@ ir . "
Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , took Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , her hand@@ ma@@ id , after Ab@@ ram had lived ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to Ab@@ ram her husband to be his wife .
I will b@@ less her , and moreover I will give you a son by her . yes , I will b@@ less her , and she will be a mother of nations . K@@ ings of peoples will come from her . "
as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard you . be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly . he will become the father of twelve pr@@ inces , and I will make him a great nation .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house , and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the same day , as God had said to him .
he lifted up his eyes and looked , and saw that three men stood opposite him . when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself to the ear@@ th ,
the two an@@ gel@@ s came to So@@ dom at evening . lot sat in the gate of So@@ dom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bo@@ wed himself with his face to the ear@@ th ,
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of So@@ dom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
but he lin@@ gered ; and the men gra@@ bbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ' hands , Yah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ci@@ ful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
see now , your ser@@ vant has found fav@@ or in your sight , and you have mag@@ ni@@ fied your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , which you have shown to me in saving my life . I can '@@ t escape to the mountain , lest ev@@ il over@@ take me , and I die .
he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in which lot lived .
lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and lived in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he was afraid to live in Zo@@ ar . he lived in a cave with his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
but God came to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch in a dream of the night , and said to him , " be@@ hold , you are a dead man , because of the woman whom you have taken . for she is a man 's wife . "
it happened , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said to her , ' This is your kin@@ d@@ ness which you shall show to me . everywhere that we go , say of me , " He is my brother . " ' "
God said to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , " D@@ on '@@ t let it be gri@@ ev@@ ous in your sight because of the boy , and because of your hand@@ ma@@ id . in all that Sar@@ ah says to you , listen to her voice . for from I@@ sa@@ ac will your se@@ ed be called .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bo@@ w shot away . for she said , " D@@ on '@@ t let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and we@@ pt .
God heard the voice of the boy . the an@@ gel of God called to Hag@@ ar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hag@@ ar ? D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose early in the morning , and s@@ add@@ led his don@@ key , and took two of his young men with him , and I@@ sa@@ ac his son . he split the wood for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Ab@@ ra@@ ham built the alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar , on the wood .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns . Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering instead of his son .
that I will b@@ less you greatly , and I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed greatly like the stars of the heav@@ ens , and like the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your se@@ ed will poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight , hear me , and ent@@ re@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place . "
now E@@ ph@@ ron was sitting in the middle of the children of H@@ eth . E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the hearing of the children of H@@ eth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Ab@@ ra@@ ham list@@ ened to E@@ ph@@ ron . Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , according to the current mer@@ chan@@ ts ' standard .
after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re ( that is , He@@ br@@ on ) , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
I will make you swe@@ ar by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en and the God of the ear@@ th , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I live .
the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls , of his master 's ca@@ me@@ ls , and depar@@ ted , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der .
the young la@@ dy was very beautiful to look at , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who has not for@@ sak@@ en his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness and his truth toward my master . as for me , Yah@@ we@@ h has led me in the way to the house of my master 's relatives . "
he said to me , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with you , and prosp@@ er your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
be@@ hold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the ma@@ iden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " P@@ le@@ ase give me a little water from your pit@@ cher to drink , "
I bo@@ wed my head , and wor@@ shi@@ ped Yah@@ we@@ h , and b@@ les@@ sed Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
the ser@@ vant brought out je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah . he also gave pre@@ ci@@ ous things to her brother and her mother .
I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there were ca@@ me@@ ls coming .
but to the sons of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts . he sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , to the east country .
I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , his sons , buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ,
now this is the history of the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ ore to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ ed@@ ar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el : one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , the sister of Lab@@ an the Syrian , to be his wife .
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will b@@ less you . for to you , and to your se@@ ed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham your father .
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was car@@ essing Re@@ bek@@ ah , his wife .
now all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped , and filled with ear@@ th .
I@@ sa@@ ac du@@ g again the wel@@ ls of water , which they had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father . for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
when E@@ sa@@ u was for@@ ty years old , he took as wife Judi@@ th , the daughter of Be@@ eri the H@@ itti@@ te , and Bas@@ em@@ ath , the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te .
it happened , that when I@@ sa@@ ac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called E@@ sa@@ u his el@@ der son , and said to him , " My son ? " he said to him , " H@@ ere I am . "
make me sav@@ ory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you before I die . "
he said , " Br@@ ing it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he d@@ rank .
he came near , and k@@ is@@ sed him . he s@@ mel@@ led the s@@ me@@ ll of his clo@@ thing , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and said , " be@@ hold , the s@@ me@@ ll of my son is as the s@@ me@@ ll of a field which Yah@@ we@@ h has b@@ les@@ sed .
it happened , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b had just gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered him , " be@@ hold , of the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th will be your d@@ wel@@ ling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your s@@ word will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k . "
the words of E@@ sa@@ u , her el@@ der son , were told to Re@@ bek@@ ah . she sent and called Jac@@ o@@ b , her younger son , and said to him , " be@@ hold , your brother E@@ sa@@ u comfor@@ ts himself about you by planning to kill you .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
your se@@ ed will be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your se@@ ed will all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
be@@ hold , I am with you , and will keep you , wher@@ ever you go , and will bring you again into this land . for I will not leave you , until I have done that which I have spoken of to you . "
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil on its top .
he looked , and be@@ hold , a well in the field , and , be@@ hold , three f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep lying there by it . for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ loc@@ ks . the stone on the well 's m@@ outh was large .
it happened , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Lab@@ an heard the news of Jac@@ o@@ b , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jac@@ o@@ b , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . Jac@@ o@@ b told Lab@@ an all these things .
I will pass through all your flock today , removing from there every spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted one , and every black one among the she@@ ep , and the spot@@ ted and spec@@ k@@ led among the go@@ ats . this will be my h@@ ire .
that day , he removed the male go@@ ats that were stre@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the female go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set the ro@@ ds which he had pe@@ eled opposite the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ t@@ rough@@ s where the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink . they conce@@ ived when they came to drink .
Jac@@ o@@ b separated the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the stre@@ aked and all the black in the flock of Lab@@ an : and he put his own dro@@ ves apart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them into Lab@@ an 's flock .
it happened during m@@ ating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and be@@ hold , the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap@@ ed on the flock were stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and be@@ hold , all the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap on the flock are stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led , for I have seen all that Lab@@ an does to you .
and he took away all his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all his pos@@ sessions which he had gathered , including the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which he had gained in Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , to go to I@@ sa@@ ac his father , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your ser@@ vant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
ple@@ ase deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every her@@ d by itself , and said to his servants , " Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space between her@@ d and her@@ d . "
therefore the children of Israel don '@@ t eat the sin@@ ew of the hip , which is on the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , to this day , because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew of the hip .
Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , R@@ ach@@ el , and the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
ple@@ ase let my lor@@ d pass over before his ser@@ vant , and I will lead on g@@ ently , according to the pace of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lor@@ d to Se@@ ir . "
he bought the par@@ cel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , the pr@@ ince of the land , saw her . he took her , lay with her , and hum@@ b@@ led her .
then will we give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to you , and we will take your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to us , and we will d@@ well with you , and we will become one people .
all who went out of the gate of his city list@@ ened to Ham@@ or , and to Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
they killed Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went away .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an alt@@ ar to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz ( that is , Be@@ the@@ l ) , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , he and all the people who were with him .
Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he spoke with him , a pil@@ lar of stone . he p@@ oured out a drink offering on it , and p@@ oured oil on it .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , his sons , his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the members of his household , with his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , all his animals , and all his pos@@ sessions , which he had gathered in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and went into a land away from his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons : Eli@@ p@@ haz , the son of A@@ da@@ h , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u ; and Re@@ uel , the son of Bas@@ em@@ ath , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .
these are the sons of Re@@ uel , E@@ sa@@ u 's son : chief N@@ ah@@ ath , chief Zer@@ ah , chief Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h , chief M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of Re@@ uel in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Tim@@ na , chief Al@@ v@@ ah , chief J@@ eth@@ eth ,
for be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and be@@ hold , my she@@ af ar@@ ose and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es came around , and bo@@ wed down to my she@@ af . "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the p@@ its , and we will say , ' A@@ n ev@@ il animal has dev@@ oured him . ' we will see what will become of his dre@@ ams . "
Re@@ ub@@ en said to them , " shed no blood . throw him into this p@@ it that is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , but lay no hand on him " -@@ -@@ that he might deliver him out of their hand , to restore him to his father .
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stri@@ pped Joseph of his co@@ at , the co@@ at of many col@@ ors that was on him ;
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a car@@ av@@ an of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes was coming from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ices and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites who were mer@@ chan@@ ts passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes that had brought him down there .
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your ser@@ vant did to me , " that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er off@@ ended their lor@@ d , the king of Egypt .
they both dre@@ amed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , the way you did when you were his c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er .
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head from off you , and will han@@ g you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your f@@ les@@ h from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the head of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them out of the river , ug@@ ly and th@@ in , and stood by the other c@@ attle on the br@@ ink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ ic@@ ians and wise men . P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dre@@ ams , but there was no one who could interpre@@ t them to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
there was with us there a young man , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said to Joseph , " I have dre@@ amed a dream , and there is no one who can interpre@@ t it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpre@@ t it . "
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be known that they had e@@ aten them , but they were still ug@@ ly , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
the th@@ in heads of gra@@ in sw@@ allowed up the seven good heads of gra@@ in . I told it to the mag@@ ic@@ ians , but there was no one who could explain it to me . "
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint over@@ se@@ ers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up gra@@ in under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not per@@ ish through the fam@@ ine . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in rob@@ es of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
he said , " be@@ hold , I have heard that there is gra@@ in in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bo@@ wed themselves down to him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with gra@@ in , and to restore each man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
the man , the lor@@ d of the land , said to us , ' By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me , and take gra@@ in for the fam@@ ine of your houses , and go your way .
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that be@@ hold , each man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
when we came to the lo@@ d@@ ging place , we opened our s@@ acks , and be@@ hold , each man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bo@@ wed themselves down to him to the ear@@ th .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans don '@@ t eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we ste@@ al silver or gold out of your lor@@ d 's house ?
he said , " F@@ ar be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the c@@ up is found , he will be my bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near to him , and said , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase let your ser@@ vant speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and don '@@ t let your an@@ ger bur@@ n against your ser@@ vant ; for you are even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
we said , ' We can '@@ t go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
then Joseph co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cri@@ ed , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
so now it was@@ n '@@ t you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , lor@@ d of all his house , and ru@@ ler over all the land of Egypt .
hur@@ ry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lor@@ d of all Egypt . come down to me . D@@ on '@@ t wait .
you shall d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your f@@ loc@@ ks , your her@@ ds , and all that you have .
the report of it was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the f@@ at of the land . '
they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said to them . when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , revi@@ ved .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s . all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , who came into Egypt , were sev@@ enty .
Joseph prepared his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Gos@@ h@@ en . he presented himself to him , and fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Y@@ our servants have been ke@@ epers of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck from our youth even until now , both we , and our fa@@ thers : ' that you may d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; for every she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
then Joseph went in and told P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their f@@ loc@@ ks , their her@@ ds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and be@@ hold , they are in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en . "
they said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pas@@ ture for your servants ' f@@ loc@@ ks . for the fam@@ ine is severe in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . now therefore , ple@@ ase let your servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the gra@@ in which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans came to Joseph , and said , " Gi@@ ve us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
they brought their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the her@@ ds , and for the don@@ ke@@ ys : and he f@@ ed them with bread in exchange for all their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck for that year .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
it will happen at the har@@ v@@ ests , that you shall give a fifth to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts will be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yo@@ urs . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
as for me , when I came from Pad@@ dan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when there was still some distance to come to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath , and I buried her there in the way to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ( the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ) . "
Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
the an@@ gel who has re@@ deemed me from all ev@@ il , b@@ less the la@@ ds , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fa@@ thers Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac . let them grow into a multi@@ tude in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th . "
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it disp@@ le@@ ased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
my sou@@ l , don '@@ t come into their council . my gl@@ ory , don '@@ t be united to their assembly ; for in their an@@ ger they killed men . in their self @@@ -@@ @ will they ham@@ str@@ ung c@@ attle .
the scep@@ ter will not de@@ part from Ju@@ da@@ h , nor the ru@@ ler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obe@@ di@@ ence of the peoples be .
but his bo@@ w remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b , ( from there is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel ) ,
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , who will b@@ less you , with b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of heav@@ en above , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the deep that lies below , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the bre@@ asts , and of the w@@ om@@ b .
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , above the boundaries of the ancient hil@@ ls . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the cro@@ wn of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
when the days of we@@ eping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , " If now I have found fav@@ or in your eyes , ple@@ ase speak in the e@@ ars of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying ,
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field , for a possession of a bur@@ ial site , from E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jac@@ o@@ b ) :
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them on the birth st@@ ool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ y@@ ru@@ s bas@@ ket for him , and co@@ ated it with tar and with pit@@ ch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
she opened it , and saw the child , and be@@ hold , the baby cri@@ ed . she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , " This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children . "
it happened in those days , when Mos@@ es had grown up , that he went out to his brothers , and looked at their bur@@ den@@ s . he saw an Egyptian striking a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his brothers .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to kill Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed because of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up to God because of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
now Mos@@ es was keeping the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro , his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , and he led the flock to the back of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and came to God 's mountain , to Ho@@ re@@ b .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to him in a fla@@ me of fire out of the mid@@ st of a b@@ ush . he looked , and be@@ hold , the b@@ ush burned with fire , and the b@@ ush was not consu@@ med .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . " Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the op@@ pression with which the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
Mos@@ es said to God , " be@@ hold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fa@@ thers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
God said moreover to Mos@@ es , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , has sent me to you . ' this is my name fore@@ ver , and this is my memorial to all generations .
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the aff@@ li@@ ction of Egypt to the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey . " '
I will give this people fav@@ or in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @@@ -@@ @ handed .
but every woman shall ask of her neigh@@ bor , and of her who visits her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
he said , " P@@ ut your hand inside your clo@@ ak again . " he put his hand inside his clo@@ ak again , and when he took it out of his clo@@ ak , be@@ hold , it had turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it on the d@@ ry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the d@@ ry land . "
you shall speak to him , and put the words in his m@@ outh . I will be with your m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what you shall do .
the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h says : ' I will not give you stra@@ w .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Wh@@ y ha@@ ven '@@ t you fulfilled your qu@@ ota both yes@@ ter@@ day and today , in making bri@@ ck as before ? "
I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their travels , in which they lived as ali@@ ens .
moreover I have heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge , and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations : Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari ; and the years of the life of L@@ evi were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h : Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el ; and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she b@@ ore him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el as his wife ; and she b@@ ore him Ph@@ ine@@ has . these are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are those who spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
go to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning . be@@ hold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " In this you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I will strike with the ro@@ d that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became f@@ oul , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the river shall s@@ warm with fro@@ gs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bed@@ room , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ov@@ ens , and into your k@@ ne@@ ading t@@ rough@@ s :
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " T@@ ell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand with your ro@@ d over the rivers , over the stre@@ ams , and over the po@@ ols , and cause fro@@ gs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and struck the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; be@@ hold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Yah@@ we@@ h says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if you will not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
I will set apart in that day the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , in which my people d@@ well , that no s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h did so ; and there came gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies .
be@@ hold , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h is on your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which are in the field , on the hor@@ ses , on the don@@ ke@@ ys , on the ca@@ me@@ ls , on the her@@ ds , and on the f@@ loc@@ ks with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make a distinc@@ tion between the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Israel and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not so much as one of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . but the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was st@@ ub@@ born , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t let the people go .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and tell him , ' This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
be@@ hold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be ha@@ il in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
the ha@@ il struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the ha@@ il struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Mos@@ es said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Yah@@ we@@ h . the th@@ unders shall ce@@ ase , neither shall there be any more ha@@ il ; that you may know that the ear@@ th is Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . "
Mos@@ es and Aaron went in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said to him , " This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , says : ' how long will you refuse to hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ self before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
and they shall cover the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , so that one won '@@ t be able to see the ear@@ th . they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which gro@@ ws for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; as neither your fa@@ thers nor your fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were on the ear@@ th to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the loc@@ ust@@ s , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the ha@@ il has left . "
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very gri@@ ev@@ ous . before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let them ask every man of his neigh@@ bor , and every woman of her neigh@@ bor , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold . "
Yah@@ we@@ h gave the people fav@@ or in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . moreover the man Mos@@ es was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who s@@ its on his th@@ r@@ one , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female ser@@ vant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
but against any of the children of Israel a do@@ g won '@@ t even bar@@ k or move its ton@@ gue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Yah@@ we@@ h makes a distinc@@ tion between the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bo@@ w down themselves to me , saying , " G@@ et out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in hot an@@ ger .
speak to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , a lam@@ b for a household ;
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two do@@ or@@ posts and on the lin@@ tel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
this is how you shall eat it : with your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in has@@ te : it is Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the go@@ ds of Egypt I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments : I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
" ' seven days you shall eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; even the first day you shall put away ye@@ ast out of your houses , for who@@ ever e@@ ats le@@ av@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance fore@@ ver .
there shall be no ye@@ ast found in your houses for seven days , for who@@ ever e@@ ats that which is le@@ av@@ ened , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a foreig@@ ner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ in , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two do@@ or@@ posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ in ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will pass through to strike the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he sees the blood on the lin@@ tel , and on the two do@@ or@@ posts , Yah@@ we@@ h will pass over the door , and will not allow the destro@@ yer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and spar@@ ed our houses . ' " the people bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
it happened at midnight , that Yah@@ we@@ h struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who sat on his th@@ r@@ one to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive who was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they asked of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yah@@ we@@ h went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yah@@ we@@ h for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yah@@ we@@ h , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
in one house shall it be e@@ aten ; you shall not carry out anything of the f@@ les@@ h abroad out of the house ; neither shall you break a bone of it .
it shall be , when Yah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give you , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
that you shall set apart to Yah@@ we@@ h all that opens the w@@ om@@ b , and every fir@@ st@@ born which you have that comes from an animal . the mal@@ es shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
every fir@@ st@@ born of a don@@ key you shall re@@ de@@ em with a lam@@ b ; and if you will not re@@ de@@ em it , then you shall break its nec@@ k ; and you shall re@@ de@@ em all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among your sons .
but God led the people around by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h went before them by day in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
Yah@@ we@@ h har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were mar@@ ching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Is@@ n '@@ t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Le@@ ave us alone , that we may serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , than that we should die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . "
I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself hon@@ or over P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and over all his armies , over his char@@ i@@ ots , and over his hor@@ se@@ men .
the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it . Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Mos@@ es and the children of Israel san@@ g this song to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " I will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h , for he has tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously . the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der he has thrown into the sea .
" you , in your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , have led the people that you have re@@ deemed . you have gui@@ ded them in your strength to your hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inher@@ it@@ ance , the place , Yah@@ we@@ h , which you have made for yo@@ ur@@ self to d@@ well in ; the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the hor@@ ses of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and Yah@@ we@@ h brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the cl@@ oud .
" I have heard the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel . speak to them , saying , ' At evening you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God . ' "
when the dew that lay had gone , be@@ hold , on the sur@@ face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness was a small round thing , small as the F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
when they meas@@ ured it with an O@@ mer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to Mos@@ es , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and became f@@ oul : and Mos@@ es was angry with them .
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel trav@@ eled from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , by their jour@@ neys , according to Yah@@ we@@ h 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
be@@ hold , I will stand before you there on the rock in Ho@@ re@@ b . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Mos@@ es did so in the sight of the el@@ ders of Israel .
it happened , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed ; and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
now J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , how that Yah@@ we@@ h had brought Israel out of Egypt .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , came with his sons and his wife to Mos@@ es into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where he was en@@ camp@@ ed , at the Mountain of God .
Mos@@ es went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bo@@ wed and k@@ is@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Mos@@ es told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Yah@@ we@@ h had done to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , all the hard@@ ships that had come on them on the way , and how Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them .
J@@ eth@@ ro said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God . Aaron came with all of the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law before God .
you shall te@@ ach them the stat@@ utes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God : men of truth , h@@ ating un@@ just gain ; and place such over them , to be rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God comman@@ ds you so , then you will be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
when they had depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and had come to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , they en@@ camp@@ ed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel en@@ camp@@ ed before the mountain .
Mos@@ es went up to God , and Yah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel :
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were th@@ unders and ligh@@ t@@ nings , and a th@@ ick cl@@ oud on the mountain , and the sound of an exce@@ ed@@ ingly l@@ oud tr@@ ump@@ et ; and all the people who were in the camp tre@@ m@@ b@@ led .
" you shall not make for yo@@ ur@@ selves an i@@ dol , nor any image of anything that is in the heav@@ ens above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
you shall not bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ self down to them , nor serve them , for I , Yah@@ we@@ h your God , am a Je@@ al@@ ous God , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation of those who h@@ ate me ,
but the seventh day is a Sab@@ b@@ ath to Yah@@ we@@ h your God . you shall not do any work in it , you , nor your son , nor your daughter , your male ser@@ vant , nor your female ser@@ vant , nor your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , nor your st@@ ran@@ ger who is within your gates ;

all the people perceived the th@@ under@@ ings , the ligh@@ t@@ nings , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and stayed at a distance .
you shall make an alt@@ ar of ear@@ th for me , and shall sacrifice on it your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and your peace offer@@ ings , your she@@ ep and your c@@ attle . in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will b@@ less you .
if you make me an alt@@ ar of stone , you shall not build it of cut stones ; for if you lift up your tool on it , you have pollu@@ ted it .

if he rises again and walk@@ s around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his he@@ aling until he is thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
but if the bul@@ l had a ha@@ bit of gor@@ ing in the past , and it has been testified to its owner , and he has not kept it in , but it has killed a man or a woman , the bul@@ l shall be st@@ oned , and its owner shall also be put to death .
or if it is known that the bul@@ l was in the ha@@ bit of gor@@ ing in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall su@@ rely pay bul@@ l for bul@@ l , and the dead animal shall be his own .

for that is his only covering , it is his gar@@ ment for his s@@ kin . what would he sle@@ ep in ? it will happen , when he cri@@ es to me , that I will hear , for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don '@@ t inv@@ oke the name of other go@@ ds , neither let them be heard out of your m@@ outh .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . seven days you shall eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , as I comman@@ ded you , at the time appointed in the month A@@ bi@@ b ( for in it you came out from Egypt ) , and no one shall appear before me empty .

Aaron said to them , " T@@ ake off the golden r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them to me . "
he received what they handed him , and fas@@ hi@@ oned it with an en@@ gra@@ ving tool , and made it a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f ; and they said , " These are your go@@ ds , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them . they have made themselves a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ ped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to it , and said , ' These are your go@@ ds , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
why should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for ev@@ il , to kill them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ? ' turn from your fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against your people .
Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in his hand ; tab@@ lets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
he said , " It is@@ n '@@ t the voice of those who sh@@ out for victory , neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome ; but the no@@ ise of those who sing that I hear . "
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger grew hot , and he threw the tab@@ lets out of his hands , and broke them ben@@ e@@ ath the mountain .
he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , ground it to pow@@ der , and sc@@ at@@ tered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said to me , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us ; for as for this Mos@@ es , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
he said to them , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his s@@ word on his th@@ igh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neigh@@ bor . ' "
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . be@@ hold , my an@@ gel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , " de@@ part , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . '
now Mos@@ es used to take the tent and to pit@@ ch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meet@@ ing . " it happened that everyone who sought Yah@@ we@@ h went out to the tent of Meet@@ ing , which was outside the camp .
it happened that when Mos@@ es went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Mos@@ es , until he had gone into the tent .
all the people saw the pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ ped , everyone at their tent door .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part out of the tent .
now therefore , if I have found fav@@ or in your sight , ple@@ ase show me now your ways , that I may know you , so that I may find fav@@ or in your sight : and consider that this nation is your people . "
it will happen , while my gl@@ ory passes by , that I will put you in a cle@@ ft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
he ch@@ is@@ eled two tab@@ lets of stone like the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount S@@ ina@@ i , as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand two stone tab@@ lets .

"
be careful , lest you make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of you :

" you shall keep the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . seven days you shall eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , as I comman@@ ded you , at the time appointed in the month A@@ bi@@ b ; for in the month A@@ bi@@ b you came out from Egypt .
for I will drive out nations before you and en@@ large your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall bring the first of the first fru@@ its of your ground to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God . " you shall not bo@@ il a young go@@ at in its mother 's milk . "
it happened , when Mos@@ es came down from Mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mountain , that Mos@@ es di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one by reason of his speaking with him .
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come near him .
but when Mos@@ es went in before Yah@@ we@@ h to speak with him , he took the ve@@ il off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was comman@@ ded .
the fin@@ ely worked gar@@ ments , for minist@@ ering in the hol@@ y place , the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office . ' "
they came , everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up , and everyone whom his spirit made willing , and brought Yah@@ we@@ h 's offering , for the work of the tent of Meet@@ ing , and for all of its service , and for the hol@@ y gar@@ ments .
the children of Israel brought a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Yah@@ we@@ h ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded to be made by Mos@@ es .
Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ el and O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted man , in whose heart Yah@@ we@@ h had put wis@@ dom , even everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come to the work to do it :
all the wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted men among those who did the work made the tab@@ ern@@ acle with ten cur@@ tains ; of fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en , blue , pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , the work of the s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man , they made them .
he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of the one cur@@ tain from the edge in the cou@@ pling . likewise he made in the edge of the cur@@ tain that was out@@ most in the second cou@@ pling .
he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops in the one cur@@ tain , and he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops in the edge of the cur@@ tain that was in the second cou@@ pling . the lo@@ ops were opposite one to another .
he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops on the edge of the cur@@ tain that was out@@ most in the cou@@ pling , and he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops on the edge of the cur@@ tain which was out@@ most in the second cou@@ pling .
B@@ ez@@ al@@ el made the Ar@@ k of ac@@ ac@@ ia wood . its length was two and a half cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th a cu@@ bit and a half , and a cu@@ bit and a half its he@@ ight .
one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b at the one end , and one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b at the other end . he made the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m of one piece with the mer@@ cy seat at its two ends .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m spread out their w@@ ings on high , covering the mer@@ cy seat with their w@@ ings , with their faces toward one another . the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were toward the mer@@ cy seat .
he made the lam@@ p@@ stand of p@@ ure gold . he made the lam@@ p@@ stand of beaten work . its base , its S@@ haf@@ t , its c@@ ups , its bu@@ ds , and its flowers were of one piece with it .
there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its one side , and three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its other side :
three c@@ ups made like al@@ mond b@@ los@@ s@@ oms in one branch , a bu@@ d and a f@@ lower , and three c@@ ups made like al@@ mond b@@ los@@ s@@ oms in the other branch , a bu@@ d and a f@@ lower : so for the six branches going out of the lam@@ p@@ stand .
and a bu@@ d under two branches of one piece with it , and a bu@@ d under two branches of one piece with it , and a bu@@ d under two branches of one piece with it , for the six branches going out of it .
he made the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se of ac@@ ac@@ ia wood . it was square : its length was a cu@@ bit , and its b@@ read@@ th a cu@@ bit . its he@@ ight was two cu@@ bi@@ ts . its hor@@ ns were of one piece with it .
he made all the vessels of the alt@@ ar , the po@@ ts , the sh@@ ov@@ els , the bas@@ ins , the for@@ ks , and the fire p@@ ans . he made all its vessels of br@@ ass .
he made the bas@@ in of br@@ ass , and its base of br@@ ass , out of the mir@@ r@@ ors of the minist@@ ering women who minist@@ ered at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
and so for the other side : on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were han@@ g@@ ings of fif@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts ; their pil@@ lars three , and their so@@ c@@ kets three .
the so@@ c@@ kets for the pil@@ lars were of br@@ ass . the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets were of silver ; and the over@@ lay@@ ing of their capitals , of silver ; and all the pil@@ lars of the court were fil@@ le@@ ted with silver .
the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ er , of blue , pur@@ ple , scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en . twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length , and the he@@ ight in the b@@ read@@ th was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , like to the han@@ g@@ ings of the court .
this is the amount of material used for the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even the T@@ ab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony , as they were counted , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , by the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
all the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the gold of the offering , was twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine tal@@ ents , and seven hundred thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the silver of those who were num@@ ber@@ ed of the Con@@ gre@@ gation was one hundred tal@@ ents , and one thousand seven hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :

they beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , in the pur@@ ple , in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , the work of the s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man .
the s@@ kil@@ l@@ fully w@@ ov@@ en band that was on it , with which to fas@@ ten it on , was of the same piece , like its work ; of gold , of blue , pur@@ ple , scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en ; as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
they worked the ony@@ x stones , en@@ closed in sett@@ ings of gold , en@@ gra@@ ved with the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , according to the names of the children of Israel .
they made two r@@ ings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , on its edge , which was toward the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d in@@ ward .
they made two r@@ ings of gold , and put them on the two sho@@ ul@@ der stra@@ ps of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , in its front , close by its cou@@ pling , above the s@@ kil@@ l@@ fully w@@ ov@@ en band of the ep@@ ho@@ d .

he raised up the court around the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the alt@@ ar , and set up the screen of the gate of the court . so Mos@@ es finished the work .

this was the work@@ manship of the lam@@ p@@ stand , beaten work of gold . from its base to its flowers , it was beaten work : according to the pat@@ tern which Yah@@ we@@ h had shown Mos@@ es , so he made the lam@@ p@@ stand .
and Aaron shall offer the L@@ evi@@ tes before Yah@@ we@@ h for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be the@@ ir@@ s to do the service of Yah@@ we@@ h .
" the L@@ evi@@ tes shall lay their hands on the heads of the bul@@ ls , and you shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , to make At@@ on@@ ement for the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the w@@ om@@ b , even the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the fir@@ st@@ born among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , I sanc@@ ti@@ fied them for myself .
Mos@@ es , and Aaron , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel did so to the L@@ evi@@ tes . according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so the children of Israel did to them .
after that , the L@@ evi@@ tes went in to do their service in the tent of Meet@@ ing before Aaron , and before his sons : as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so they did to them .
" this is that which belongs to the L@@ evi@@ tes : from twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old and up@@ ward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meet@@ ing ;
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of this month , at evening , you shall keep it in its appointed se@@ as@@ on@@ -@@ -@@ according to all its stat@@ utes , and according to all its ord@@ inan@@ ces , you shall keep it . "
they kept the P@@ ass@@ over in the first month , on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , at evening , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i . according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the P@@ ass@@ over on that day , and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day .
those men said to him , " We are un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man . why are we kept back , that we may not offer the offering of Yah@@ we@@ h in its appointed season among the children of Israel ? "
but the man who is clean , and is not on a journey , and fails to keep the P@@ ass@@ over , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people . because he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t offer the offering of Yah@@ we@@ h in its appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was raised up , the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even the tent of the testimony : and at evening it was over the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until morning .
wh@@ en@@ ever the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel trav@@ eled ; and in the place where the cl@@ oud remained , there the children of Israel en@@ camp@@ ed .
" make two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
when you go to war in your land against the ad@@ versary who op@@ pres@@ ses you , then you shall sound an alarm with the tr@@ ump@@ ets . then you will be remember@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you will be sav@@ ed from your enem@@ ies .
it happened in the second year , in the second month , on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the re@@ ar guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i was over his army .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yah@@ we@@ h does to us , we will do the same to you . "
the people were compla@@ ining in the e@@ ars of Yah@@ we@@ h . when Yah@@ we@@ h heard it , his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and Yah@@ we@@ h 's fire bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med some of the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the camp .
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mil@@ ls , or beat it in mor@@ tar@@ s , and bo@@ iled it in po@@ ts , and made cak@@ es of it . its tas@@ te was like the tas@@ te of fresh oil .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " G@@ ather to me sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of Israel , whom you know to be the el@@ ders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the tent of Meet@@ ing , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spiri@@ t which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yo@@ ur@@ self alone .
but a whole month , until it come out at your nos@@ tr@@ ils , and it is lo@@ ath@@ some to you ; because that you have rejected Yah@@ we@@ h who is among you , and have we@@ pt before him , saying , " Wh@@ y did we come out of Egypt ? " ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h came down in the cl@@ oud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spiri@@ t that was on him , and put it on the sev@@ enty el@@ ders : and it happened that when the Spiri@@ t rested on them , they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , but they did so no more .
but two men remained in the camp . the name of one was El@@ dad , and the name of the other Med@@ ad : and the Spiri@@ t rested on them ; and they were of those who were written , but had not gone out to the tent ; and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the camp .
a wind from Yah@@ we@@ h went out and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cu@@ bi@@ ts above the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the qu@@ ails . he who gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , before it was che@@ wed , the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and Yah@@ we@@ h struck the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
with him I will speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even pla@@ in@@ ly , and not in rid@@ d@@ les ; and he shall see Yah@@ we@@ h 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant , against Mos@@ es ? "
Aaron said to Mos@@ es , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase don '@@ t count this sin against us , in which we have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , and in which we have sin@@ ned .
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they d@@ well in , whether in camps , or in stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ;
they went up by the South , and came to He@@ br@@ on ; and Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were there . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
they went and came to Mos@@ es , and to Aaron , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an , to K@@ ade@@ sh ; and brought back word to them , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and showed them the fruit of the land .
A@@ mal@@ ek d@@ wel@@ ls in the land of the South : and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , d@@ well in the hill country ; and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite d@@ wel@@ ls by the sea , and along by the side of the Jordan . "
all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said to them , " Wo@@ uld that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
and they spoke to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , saying , " The land , which we passed through to sp@@ y it out , is an exceeding good land .
'@@ Yah@@ we@@ h is slow to an@@ ger , and ab@@ und@@ ant in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , for@@ giving in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence ; and that will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , on the third and on the fourth generation . '
because all those men who have seen my gl@@ ory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , yet have temp@@ ted me these ten times , and have not list@@ ened to my voice ;
your dead bodies shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and all who were num@@ ber@@ ed of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , who have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,

I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken , su@@ rely this will I do to all this ev@@ il Con@@ gre@@ gation , who are gathered together against me : in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they shall be consu@@ med , and there they shall die . "
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " be@@ hold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h has promised : for we have sin@@ ned . "
and will make an offering by fire to Yah@@ we@@ h , a bur@@ n@@ t offering , or a sacrifice , to accomp@@ lish a vo@@ w , or as a fre@@ e@@ will offering , or in your set fe@@ asts , to make a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a to Yah@@ we@@ h , of the her@@ d , or of the flock ;

of the first of your d@@ ough you shall offer up a c@@ ake for a wave offering : as the wave offering of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , so you shall he@@ ave it .
then it shall be , if it be done un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , without the knowledge of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer one young bul@@ l for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a to Yah@@ we@@ h , with the me@@ al offering of it , and the drink offering of it , according to the ordin@@ ance , and one male go@@ at for a sin offering .
the pri@@ est shall make At@@ on@@ ement for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and they shall be for@@ given ; for it was an er@@ ror , and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire to Yah@@ we@@ h , and their sin offering before Yah@@ we@@ h , for their er@@ ror :
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel shall be for@@ given , and the st@@ ran@@ ger who lives as a foreig@@ ner among them ; for in respect of all the people it was done un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly .
you shall have one law for him who does anything un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , for him who is native @@@ -@@ @ born among the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger who lives as a foreig@@ ner among them .
" ' but the sou@@ l who does anything with a high hand , whether he is native @@@ -@@ @ born or a foreig@@ ner , the same b@@ las@@ phe@@ mes Yah@@ we@@ h ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fr@@ inges in the borders of their gar@@ ments throughout their generations , and that they put on the f@@ rin@@ ge of each border a cor@@ d of blue :
and it shall be to you for a f@@ rin@@ ge , that you may look on it , and remember all the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h , and do them ; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes , after which you use to play the pro@@ stitute ;
and he spoke to Kor@@ ah and to all his company , saying , " In the morning Yah@@ we@@ h will show who are his , and who is hol@@ y , and will cause him to come near to him : even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him .
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , but you must also make yo@@ ur@@ self a pr@@ ince over us ?
so they went away from the tent of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram came out , and stood at the door of their ten@@ ts , and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their little ones .
and the ear@@ th opened its m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their households , and all the men who ap@@ per@@ tained to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
it happened , when the Con@@ gre@@ gation was assemb@@ led against Mos@@ es and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of Meet@@ ing : and be@@ hold , the cl@@ oud covered it , and the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , saying ,
Aaron did as Mos@@ es said , and ran into the mid@@ st of the assembly ; and be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue has begun among the people : and he put on the incen@@ se , and made At@@ on@@ ement for the people .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them ro@@ ds , one for each fa@@ thers ' house , of all their pr@@ inces according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , twelve ro@@ ds : write every man 's name on his ro@@ d .
it shall happen , that the ro@@ d of the man whom I shall choose shall bu@@ d : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , which they mur@@ mur against you . "
Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their pr@@ inces gave him ro@@ ds , for each pr@@ ince one , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , even twelve ro@@ ds : and the ro@@ d of Aaron was among their ro@@ ds .
it happened on the next day , that Mos@@ es went into the tent of the testimony ; and be@@ hold , the ro@@ d of Aaron for the house of L@@ evi was bud@@ ded , and put forth bu@@ ds , and produced b@@ los@@ s@@ oms , and b@@ ore ri@@ pe al@@ mon@@ ds .
they shall keep your comman@@ ds , and the duty of all the tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and to the alt@@ ar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
I , be@@ hold , I have taken your brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Yah@@ we@@ h , to do the service of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Aaron , " I , be@@ hold , I have given you the command of my wave offer@@ ings , even all the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel ; to you have I given them by reason of the ano@@ in@@ ting , and to your sons , as a portion fore@@ ver .
this shall be yo@@ urs of the most hol@@ y things from the fire : every offering of the@@ ir@@ s , even every me@@ al offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every sin offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every t@@ res@@ pass offering of the@@ ir@@ s , which they shall ren@@ der to me , shall be most hol@@ y for you and for your sons .
" all the best of the oil , and all the best of the vin@@ t@@ age , and of the gra@@ in , the first fru@@ its of them which they give to Yah@@ we@@ h , to you have I given them .
you shall re@@ de@@ em those who are to be re@@ deemed of them from a month old , according to your esti@@ mation , for five sh@@ ek@@ els of money , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary ( the same is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s ) .
" to the children of L@@ evi , be@@ hold , I have given all the ti@@ the in Israel for an inher@@ it@@ ance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
for the ti@@ the of the children of Israel , which they offer as a wave offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , I have given to the L@@ evi@@ tes for an inher@@ it@@ ance : therefore I have said to them , ' A@@ mon@@ g the children of Israel they shall have no inher@@ it@@ ance . ' "
" moreover you shall speak to the L@@ evi@@ tes , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the ti@@ the which I have given you from them for your inher@@ it@@ ance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yah@@ we@@ h , a ti@@ the of the ti@@ the .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yah@@ we@@ h of all your ti@@ th@@ es , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Yah@@ we@@ h 's wave offering to Aaron the pri@@ est .
" therefore you shall tell them , ' When you he@@ ave its best from it , then it shall be rec@@ kon@@ ed to the L@@ evi@@ tes as the increase of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and as the increase of the win@@ e@@ press .
you shall bear no sin by reason of it , when you have heav@@ ed from it its best : and you shall not prof@@ ane the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , that you not die . ' "
" this is the statute of the law which Yah@@ we@@ h has comman@@ ded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red he@@ if@@ er without spot , in which is no ble@@ mis@@ h , and which was never yok@@ ed .
you shall give her to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp , and one shall kill her before his face :

the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , came into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people stayed in K@@ ade@@ sh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
why have you made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in to this ev@@ il place ? it is no place of se@@ ed , or of fig@@ s , or of v@@ ines , or of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates ; neither is there any water to drink . "
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you rebel@@ led against my word at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah .
the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the king of Ara@@ d , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Ath@@ ar@@ im ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them cap@@ tive .
they trav@@ eled from Mount H@@ or by the way to the Red Sea , to comp@@ ass the land of E@@ dom : and the sou@@ l of the people was much dis@@ cour@@ aged because of the way .
Mos@@ es made a ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a ser@@ p@@ ent had bit@@ ten any man , when he looked to the ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , he lived .
from there they trav@@ eled , and en@@ camp@@ ed on the other side of the Ar@@ non , which is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that comes out of the border of the Am@@ ori@@ tes : for the Ar@@ non is the border of Mo@@ a@@ b , between Mo@@ a@@ b and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
" let me pass through your land : we will not turn aside into field , or into v@@ ine@@ yard ; we will not drink of the water of the wel@@ ls : we will go by the king 's highway , until we have passed your border . "
Israel struck him with the edge of the s@@ word , and poss@@ essed his land from the Ar@@ non to the J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , even to the children of Am@@ mon ; for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
for H@@ es@@ h@@ bon was the city of S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Ar@@ non .
the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and spoke to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went ; and the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h placed himself in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding on his don@@ key , and his two servants were with him .
the don@@ key saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his s@@ word drawn in his hand ; and the don@@ key turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am struck the don@@ key , to turn her into the way .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
then Yah@@ we@@ h opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his s@@ word drawn in his hand ; and he bo@@ wed his head , and fell on his face .
when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is on the border of the Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most part of the border .

those who were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were twenty @@@ -@@ @ three thousand , every male from a month old and up@@ ward : for they were not num@@ ber@@ ed among the children of Israel , because there was no inher@@ it@@ ance given them among the children of Israel .
but among these there was not a man of them who were num@@ ber@@ ed by Mos@@ es and Aaron the pri@@ est , who num@@ ber@@ ed the children of Israel in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
" our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yah@@ we@@ h in the company of Kor@@ ah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
" the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had speak right : you shall su@@ rely give them a possession of an inher@@ it@@ ance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inher@@ it@@ ance of their father to pass to them .
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inher@@ it@@ ance to pass to his daughter .
because you rebel@@ led against my word in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in , in the stri@@ fe of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me at the waters before their eyes . " ( these are the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in . )

and three tenth parts of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine fl@@ our for a me@@ al offering , mixed with oil , for each bul@@ l ; and two tenth parts of fine fl@@ our for a me@@ al offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
their drink offer@@ ings shall be half a hin of wine for a bul@@ l , and the third part of a hin for the ram , and the fourth part of a hin for a lam@@ b : this is the bur@@ n@@ t offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
in this way you shall offer daily , for seven days , the food of the offering made by fire , of a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a to Yah@@ we@@ h : it shall be offered besides the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the drink offering of it .

and her father he@@ ars her vo@@ w , and her bond with which she has bound her sou@@ l , and her father holds his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she has bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her father dis@@ allow her in the day that he he@@ ars , none of her vows , or of her bonds with which she has bound her sou@@ l , shall stand : and Yah@@ we@@ h will for@@ give her , because her father dis@@ allowed her .
and her husband he@@ ars it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he he@@ ars it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her sou@@ l shall stand .

but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day , then he establis@@ hes all her vows , or all her bonds , which are on her : he has established them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
Mos@@ es sent them , one thousand of every tri@@ be , to the war , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the tr@@ ump@@ ets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Mi@@ dian with the rest of their sla@@ in : Evi , and Rek@@ em , and Z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , the five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they killed with the s@@ word .
the children of Israel took cap@@ tive the women of Mi@@ dian and their little ones ; and all their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods , they took for a pre@@ y .
they brought the cap@@ tives , and the pre@@ y , and the sp@@ oil , to Mos@@ es , and to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and to the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , which are by the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Mos@@ es was angry with the officers of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
as to every gar@@ ment , and all that is made of s@@ kin , and all work of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir , and all things made of wood , you shall pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
" take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;

and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
even of the children of Israel 's half , Mos@@ es took one drawn out of every fif@@ ty , both of man and of animal , and gave them to the L@@ evi@@ tes , who performed the duty of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h ; as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near to Mos@@ es ;
and they said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ our servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yah@@ we@@ h , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
now the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad had a very great multi@@ tude of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and when they saw the land of Jaz@@ er , and the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that be@@ hold , the place was a place for li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck ;
for when they went up to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yah@@ we@@ h had given them .
Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander back and forth in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , who had done ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , was consu@@ med .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the for@@ ti@@ fied cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land is sub@@ du@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h ; then after@@ ward you shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less towards Yah@@ we@@ h , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Mos@@ es comman@@ ded concerning them to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
Mos@@ es gave to them , even to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , the k@@ ing@@ dom of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the land , according to its cities and borders , even the cities of the surrounding land .
the children of Re@@ ub@@ en built H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
they trav@@ eled from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the next day after the P@@ ass@@ over the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
they trav@@ eled from before Ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the mid@@ st of the sea into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and they went three days ' journey in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Eth@@ am , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Mar@@ ah .
Aaron the pri@@ est went up into Mount H@@ or at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , and died there , in the for@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the king of Ara@@ d , who lived in the South in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone id@@ ols , destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and demol@@ ish all their high places .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pri@@ cks in your eyes and as thor@@ ns in your sides , and they will har@@ ass you in the land in which you d@@ well .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an according to its borders ) ,
and your border shall turn about sou@@ th@@ ward of the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass along to Z@@ in ; and the go@@ ings out of it shall be sou@@ th@@ ward of K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea ; and it shall go forth to Hazar Ad@@ dar , and pass along to Az@@ mon ;

because he should have remained in his city of ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' you shall take no ran@@ so@@ m for him who is fled to his city of ref@@ uge , that he may come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
" ' so you shall not poll@@ ute the land in which you are : for blood , it pollu@@ tes the land ; and no exp@@ iation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed there@@ in , but by the blood of him who shed it .
the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the family of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel :
and they said , " Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by Yah@@ we@@ h to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
when the ju@@ bil@@ ee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inher@@ it@@ ance be added to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be where@@ un@@ to they shall belong : so will their inher@@ it@@ ance be taken away from the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of our fa@@ thers . "
this is the thing which Yah@@ we@@ h does command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they be married .
every daughter who poss@@ esses an inher@@ it@@ ance in any tri@@ be of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tri@@ be of her father , that the children of Israel may poss@@ ess every man the inher@@ it@@ ance of his fa@@ thers .
it happened in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment to them ;
be@@ hold , I have set the land before you : go in and poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , to give to them and to their se@@ ed after them . "
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
and you mur@@ mu@@ red in your ten@@ ts , and said , " Bec@@ ause Yah@@ we@@ h ha@@ ted us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us .
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cl@@ oud by day .
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or ev@@ il , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore ;
D@@ on '@@ t conten@@ d with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the fo@@ ot to tre@@ ad on ; because I have given Mount Se@@ ir to E@@ sa@@ u for a possession .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
so we passed by from our brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir , from the way of the Ara@@ bah from E@@ la@@ th and from E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber . we turned and passed by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and the Av@@ vi@@ m , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ im , who came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non : be@@ hold , I have given into your hand S@@ ih@@ on the Am@@ or@@ ite , king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and his land ; begin to poss@@ ess it , and conten@@ d with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of you . "
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the val@@ ley , even to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not a city too high for us ; Yah@@ we@@ h our God delivered up all before us :
only to the land of the children of Am@@ mon you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come near ; all the side of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , and the cities of the hill country , and wher@@ ever Yah@@ we@@ h our God for@@ b@@ ade us .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " D@@ on '@@ t fear him ; for I have delivered him , and all his people , and his land , into your hand ; and you shall do to him as you did to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who lived at H@@ es@@ h@@ bon . "
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes who were beyond the Jordan , from the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon .
( for only O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an remained of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im ; be@@ hold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is@@ n '@@ t it in R@@ ab@@ bah of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cu@@ bi@@ ts was its length , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts its b@@ read@@ th , after the cu@@ bit of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and half the hill country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and its cities , gave I to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes :
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , even all B@@ ash@@ an . ( the same is called the land of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even to the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , the middle of the val@@ ley , and its border , even to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
" Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , you have begun to show your ser@@ vant your gre@@ at@@ ness , and your strong hand : for what go@@ d is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to your works , and according to your m@@ igh@@ ty acts ?
go up to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and lift up your eyes w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
only take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self , and keep your sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they de@@ part from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;

out of heav@@ en he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruc@@ t you : and on ear@@ th he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
because he lov@@ ed your fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought you out with his presence , with his great power , out of Egypt ;
that the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er might flee there , who kills his neigh@@ bor un@@ awar@@ es , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t h@@ ate him in time past ; and that fle@@ eing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between Yah@@ we@@ h and you at that time , to show you the word of Yah@@ we@@ h : for you were afraid because of the fire , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an en@@ gra@@ ved image for yo@@ ur@@ self , any lik@@ eness of what is in heav@@ en above , or what is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
you shall not bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ self to them , nor serve them ; for I , Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , am a Je@@ al@@ ous God , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers on the children , and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who h@@ ate me ;
you shall remember that you were a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God brought you out of there by a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by an out@@ stret@@ ched arm : therefore Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you to keep the Sab@@ b@@ ath day .
" neither shall you c@@ ov@@ et your neigh@@ bor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neigh@@ bor 's house , his field , or his male ser@@ vant , or his female ser@@ vant , his o@@ x , or his don@@ key , or anything that is your neigh@@ bor 's . "
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and you said , " be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h our God has shown us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
Yah@@ we@@ h heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
you shall walk in all the way which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land which you shall poss@@ ess .
that you might fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
hear therefore , Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with you , and that you may increase m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has promised to you , in a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
and you shall te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the mid@@ st of you is a Je@@ al@@ ous God ; lest the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h your God be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the ear@@ th .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash their pil@@ lars in pieces , and cut down their Ash@@ er@@ im , and bur@@ n their en@@ gra@@ ved images with fire .
but because Yah@@ we@@ h lov@@ es you , and because he would keep the oath which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , has Yah@@ we@@ h brought you out with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge , from the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h will take away from you all si@@ ck@@ ness ; and none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who h@@ ate you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to per@@ ish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
who f@@ ed you in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with man@@ na , which your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; that he might hum@@ ble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
remember , don '@@ t forget , how you provoked Yah@@ we@@ h your God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against Yah@@ we@@ h .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which Yah@@ we@@ h made with you , then I stayed on the mountain for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; I neither ate bread nor d@@ rank water .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the fin@@ ger of God ; and on them were all the words which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke with you on the mountain out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " arise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have cor@@ rupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I comman@@ ded them ; they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten image . "
I pray@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t destroy your people and your inher@@ it@@ ance , that you have re@@ deemed through your gre@@ at@@ ness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand .
lest the land you brought us out from say , ' Bec@@ ause Yah@@ we@@ h was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them , and because he ha@@ ted them , he has brought them out to kill them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . '
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you on the mountain out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them to me .
( the children of Israel trav@@ eled from Be@@ ero@@ th B@@ ene Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ er@@ ah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his place .

and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how Yah@@ we@@ h has destroyed them to this day ;
and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give to them and to their se@@ ed , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
for the land , where you go in to poss@@ ess it , is@@ n '@@ t as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you so@@ wed your se@@ ed , and wat@@ ered it with your fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs ;
a land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God car@@ es for : the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your gra@@ in , and your new wine , and your oil .

therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l ; and you shall bin@@ d them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall te@@ ach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
every place where@@ on the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even to the hin@@ der sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you on all the land that you shall tre@@ ad on , as he has spoken to you .
and the cur@@ se , if you shall not listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which you have not known .
it shall happen , when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall bring you into the land where you go to poss@@ ess it , that you shall set the b@@ les@@ sing on Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se on Mount E@@ bal .
A@@ ren '@@ t they beyond the Jordan , behind the way of the going down of the sun , in the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who d@@ well in the Ara@@ bah , over against G@@ ilg@@ al , bes@@ ide the o@@ aks of Mo@@ re@@ h ?
these are the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces which you shall observe to do in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has given you to poss@@ ess it , all the days that you live on the ear@@ th .
you shall su@@ rely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , on the high mountains , and on the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash in pieces their pil@@ lars , and bur@@ n their Ash@@ er@@ im with fire ; and you shall cut down the en@@ gra@@ ved images of their go@@ ds ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose out of all your tri@@ bes , to put his name there , even to his habi@@ tation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and your ti@@ th@@ es , and the wave offering of your hand , and your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you .
then it shall happen that to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h .
but in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose in one of your tri@@ bes , there you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
you may not eat within your gates the ti@@ the of your gra@@ in , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vo@@ w , nor your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall en@@ large your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your sou@@ l desi@@ res to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
if the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your her@@ d and of your flock , which Yah@@ we@@ h has given you , as I have comman@@ ded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
and you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and the blood of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and you shall eat the f@@ les@@ h .
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and you dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and d@@ well in their land ;
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self that you not be en@@ s@@ nar@@ ed to follow them , after that they are destroyed from before you ; and that you not inqu@@ ire after their go@@ ds , saying , " Ho@@ w do these nations serve their go@@ ds ? I will do likewise . "
you shall not do so to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , which he ha@@ tes , have they done to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters do they bur@@ n in the fire to their go@@ ds .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other go@@ ds " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall not listen to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or to that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God proves you , to know whether you love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then you shall inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in the mid@@ st of you ,
you shall su@@ rely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in and its li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , with the edge of the s@@ word .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yah@@ we@@ h may turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger , and show you mer@@ cy , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and multi@@ ply you , as he has sworn to your fa@@ thers ;
for you are a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the ear@@ th .
every animal that parts the ho@@ of , and has the ho@@ of cl@@ ov@@ en in two and che@@ ws the cu@@ d , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pi@@ g , because it has a split ho@@ of but do@@ es@@ n '@@ t ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , is un@@ clean to you : of their f@@ les@@ h you shall not eat , and their car@@ c@@ ass@@ es you shall not touch .
then you shall turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the ti@@ the of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not har@@ den your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
you shall su@@ rely give him , and your heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
for the poor will never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall su@@ rely open your hand to your brother , to your ne@@ edy , and to your poor , in your land .
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your th@@ res@@ hing floor , and out of your win@@ e@@ press ; as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you , you shall give to him .
you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
no ye@@ ast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days ; neither shall any of the f@@ les@@ h , which you sacrifice the first day at evening , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well in , there you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
you shall count for yo@@ ur@@ selves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the standing gra@@ in you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yah@@ we@@ h your God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yah@@ we@@ h your God b@@ les@@ ses you :
and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male ser@@ vant , and your female ser@@ vant , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , who are within your gates .
you shall keep a feast to Yah@@ we@@ h your God seven days in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; because Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you in all your increase , and in all the work of your hands , and you shall be altogether jo@@ y@@ ful .
you shall not w@@ rest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does b@@ lin@@ d the eyes of the wise , and per@@ ver@@ t the words of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
if there is found in the mid@@ st of you , within any of your gates which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inqu@@ ire dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and be@@ hold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in Israel ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this ev@@ il thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the m@@ outh of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
if there ar@@ ises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose ;
and you shall come to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inqu@@ ire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall te@@ ach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall te@@ ach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , in not list@@ ening to the pri@@ est who stands to minister there before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and shall poss@@ ess it , and shall d@@ well there@@ in , and shall say , " I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are around me " ;
you shall su@@ rely set him king over yo@@ ur@@ selves , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreig@@ ner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multi@@ ply hor@@ ses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multi@@ ply hor@@ ses ; because Yah@@ we@@ h has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
it shall be , when he s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book , out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read there@@ in all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h his God , to keep all the words of this law and these stat@@ utes , to do them ;
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
this shall be the pri@@ ests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep , that they shall give to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
the first fru@@ its of your gra@@ in , of your new wine , and of your oil , and the first of the F@@ le@@ ece of your she@@ ep , you shall give him .
if a Lev@@ ite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreig@@ ner , and comes with all the desire of his sou@@ l to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ;
for these nations , that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess , listen to those who practice sor@@ cer@@ y , and to di@@ vin@@ ers ; but as for you , Yah@@ we@@ h your God has not allowed you so to do .
this is according to all that you desi@@ red of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
I will raise them up a pro@@ phe@@ t from among their brothers , like you ; and I will put my words in his m@@ outh , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
it shall happen , that who@@ ever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , who shall speak a word pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , that same pro@@ phe@@ t shall die . "
but if any man ha@@ tes his neigh@@ bor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mort@@ ally so that he dies , and he fle@@ es into one of these cities ;
you shall not remove your neigh@@ bor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inher@@ it@@ ance which you shall inher@@ it , in the land that Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to poss@@ ess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sin@@ s : at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or at the m@@ outh of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enem@@ ies , and see hor@@ ses , char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
what man is there who has plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fear@@ ful and fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart mel@@ t as his heart . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint cap@@ tains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found there@@ in shall become tri@@ but@@ ary to you , and shall serve you .
but the women , and the little ones , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that is in the city , even all its sp@@ oil , you shall take for a pre@@ y to yo@@ ur@@ self ; and you shall eat the sp@@ oil of your enem@@ ies , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bul@@ war@@ ks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
and it shall be , that the city which is near@@ est to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take a he@@ if@@ er of the her@@ d , which has@@ n '@@ t been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
it shall be , if you have no de@@ light in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a sla@@ ve , because you have hum@@ b@@ led her .
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inher@@ it that which he has , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed the fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , who is the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they ch@@ as@@ ten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the el@@ ders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the el@@ ders of his city , " This our son is st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous , he will not obe@@ y our voice ; he is a gl@@ ut@@ ton , and a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d . "
his body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall su@@ rely bur@@ y him the same day ; for he who is han@@ ged is accur@@ sed of God ; that you don '@@ t def@@ ile your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
so you shall do with his don@@ key ; and so you shall do with his gar@@ ment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yo@@ ur@@ self .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eg@@ gs , and the h@@ en sitting on the young , or on the eg@@ gs , you shall not take the h@@ en with the young :
you shall not so@@ w your v@@ ine@@ yard with two kinds of se@@ ed , lest the whole fruit be for@@ fe@@ ited , the se@@ ed which you have so@@ wn , and the increase of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
and acc@@ uses her of sha@@ me@@ ful things , and brings up an ev@@ il name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find in her the to@@ ken@@ s of vir@@ gin@@ ity " ;
then shall the father of the young la@@ dy , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the young la@@ dy 's vir@@ gin@@ ity to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
but if the man find the la@@ dy who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
then the man who lay with her shall give to the la@@ dy 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ b@@ led her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or from P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se you .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall ba@@ the himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
and you shall have a p@@ add@@ le among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall di@@ g there@@ with , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God walk@@ s in the mid@@ st of your camp , to deliver you , and to give up your enem@@ ies before you ; therefore your camp shall be hol@@ y , that he may not see an un@@ clean thing in you , and turn away from you .
he shall d@@ well with you , in the mid@@ st of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it ple@@ ases him best : you shall not op@@ press him .
you shall not bring the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a do@@ g , into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
to a foreig@@ ner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God may b@@ less you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
that which is gone out of your li@@ ps you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , a fre@@ e@@ will offering , which you have promised with your m@@ outh .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then you may eat of grap@@ es your fill at your own pleas@@ ure ; but you shall not put any in your ves@@ sel .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's standing gra@@ in , then you may p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars with your hand ; but you shall not move a si@@ ck@@ le to your neigh@@ bor 's standing gra@@ in .
when a man takes a wife , and mar@@ ries her , then it shall be , if she find no fav@@ or in his eyes , because he has found some un@@ seem@@ ly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
when a man takes a new wife , he shall not go out in the army , neither shall he be assigned any business : he shall be free at home one year , and shall che@@ er his wife whom he has taken .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a sla@@ ve , or sell him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that you observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so you shall observe to do .
in his day you shall give him his h@@ ire , neither shall the sun go down on it ; for he is poor , and sets his heart on it : lest he cry against you to Yah@@ we@@ h , and it be sin to you .
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , by number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then your brother should seem v@@ ile to you .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secre@@ ts ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hin@@ d@@ most of you , all who were fe@@ e@@ ble behind you , when you were fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear God .
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a bas@@ ket , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
you shall come to the pri@@ est who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I prof@@ ess this day to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , that I am come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers to give us . "
now , be@@ hold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yah@@ we@@ h , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and worship before Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all the good which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you .
you have declared Yah@@ we@@ h this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and listen to his voice :
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , that you shall set yo@@ ur@@ self up great stones , and plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount E@@ bal , and you shall plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter .
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God will set you on high above all the nations of the ear@@ th :
you shall be b@@ les@@ sed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the young of your flock .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make you the head , and not the ta@@ il ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be ben@@ e@@ ath ; if you shall listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other go@@ ds to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with consumption , and with f@@ ever , and with inf@@ lam@@ mation , and with fi@@ ery heat , and with the s@@ word , and with b@@ light , and with mil@@ dew ; and they shall pursue you until you per@@ ish .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th ; and there shall be none to fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with the bo@@ il of Egypt , and with the t@@ um@@ ors , and with the s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , and with the it@@ ch , of which you can not be he@@ aled .
and you shall gro@@ pe at no@@ on@@ day , as the b@@ lin@@ d gro@@ pes in d@@ ark@@ ness , and you shall not prosp@@ er in your ways : and you shall be only op@@ pressed and ro@@ bbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not d@@ well there@@ in : you shall plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and shall not use its fruit .
your o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your don@@ key shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your she@@ ep shall be given to your enem@@ ies , and you shall have none to save you .
your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bo@@ il , of which you can not be he@@ aled , from the sole of your fo@@ ot to the cro@@ wn of your head .
the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and over@@ take you , until you are destroyed ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which he comman@@ ded you :
they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates , until your high and for@@ ti@@ fied walls come down , in which you tr@@ usted , throughout all your land ; and they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the f@@ les@@ h of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enemy shall dist@@ ress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , Y@@ A@@ H@@ W@@ E@@ H your God ;
it shall happen that as Yah@@ we@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you , so Yah@@ we@@ h will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to cause you to per@@ ish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will sc@@ at@@ ter you among all peoples , from the one end of the ear@@ th even to the other end of the ear@@ th ; and there you shall serve other go@@ ds , which you have not known , you nor your fa@@ thers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your fo@@ ot : but Yah@@ we@@ h will give you there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of sou@@ l ;
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , besides the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
Mos@@ es called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Yah@@ we@@ h did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
and we took their land , and gave it for an inher@@ it@@ ance to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the Man@@ as@@ sites .
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreig@@ ner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses with which Yah@@ we@@ h has made it si@@ ck ;
then men shall say , " Bec@@ ause they for@@ so@@ ok the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l ;
that then Yah@@ we@@ h your God will turn your cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has sc@@ at@@ tered you .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will circum@@ c@@ ise your heart , and the heart of your se@@ ed , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , that you may live .
if you shall obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l .
neither is it beyond the sea , that you should say , " Wh@@ o shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
I den@@ oun@@ ce to you this day , that you shall su@@ rely per@@ ish ; you shall not prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
assem@@ ble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreig@@ ner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to their fa@@ thers , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and grown f@@ at ; then will they turn to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and desp@@ ise me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
it happened , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
when the Most High gave to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bo@@ unds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God . they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities . I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those who are not a people . I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
I will make my ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood . my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h with the blood of the sla@@ in and the cap@@ tives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
" go up into this mountain of A@@ bar@@ im , to Mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and see the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount H@@ or , and was gathered to his people :
because you t@@ res@@ passed against me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
who said of his father , and of his mother , ' I have not seen him ; ' Ne@@ ither did he acknowledge his brothers , N@@ or did he know his own children : for they have observed your word , and keep your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for they shall draw out the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the s@@ and . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " This is the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of your m@@ outh , but you shall medi@@ t@@ ate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
it happened about the time of the sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don '@@ t know . pursue them quickly ; for you will over@@ take them . "
as soon as we had heard it , our hear@@ ts mel@@ ted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heav@@ en above , and on ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath .
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , you shall bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yo@@ ur@@ self into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , " When you see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then you shall move from your place , and follow it .
you shall command the pri@@ ests who bear the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , saying , ' When you come to the br@@ ink of the waters of the Jordan , you shall stand still in the Jordan . ' "
Jos@@ hua said , " Her@@ e@@ by you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite out from before you .
and when those who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had di@@ pped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan over@@ flows all its banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est ) ,
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h passed over , with the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
it happened , when the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up to the d@@ ry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God dri@@ ed up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God did to the Red Sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the next day , after they had e@@ aten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have man@@ na any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
it was so , that when Jos@@ hua had spoken to the people , the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns before Yah@@ we@@ h advanced , and ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h followed them .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and mar@@ ched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they mar@@ ched around the city seven times .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yah@@ we@@ h . only Ra@@ ha@@ b the pro@@ stitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
but as for you , only keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accur@@ sed , and trouble it .
the young men who were sp@@ ies went in , and brought out Ra@@ ha@@ b with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron into the treas@@ ury of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but Ra@@ ha@@ b the pro@@ stitute , her father 's household , and all that she had , Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed alive . she lived in the mid@@ st of Israel to this day , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , whom Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the devoted things ; for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger burned against the children of Israel .
Jos@@ hua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ I , which is bes@@ ide Beth Av@@ en , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and spoke to them , saying , " G@@ o up and sp@@ y out the land . " the men went up and sp@@ ied out A@@ I .
Jos@@ hua said , " A@@ las , Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to cause us to per@@ ish ? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan !
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he has , because he has trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because he has done a dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful thing in Israel . ' "
he brought near his household man by man , and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was selected .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Jos@@ hua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up to A@@ I . Jos@@ hua chose thirty thousand men , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , and sent them out by night .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I have comman@@ ded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and en@@ camp@@ ed on the north side of A@@ I . now there was a val@@ ley between him and A@@ I .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in which they pursu@@ ed them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all Israel returned to A@@ I , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the low@@ land , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , heard of it
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and has become m@@ ol@@ dy .
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that they heard that they were their neigh@@ b@@ ors , and that they lived among them .
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and en@@ camp@@ ed against Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
it happened , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great sla@@ ughter until they were consu@@ med , and the re@@ mn@@ ant which remained of them had entered into the for@@ ti@@ fied cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king and all its cities , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed it , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it .
it happened , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or heard of it , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Ara@@ bah south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , in the low@@ land , and in the he@@ ights of D@@ or on the west ,
to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the hill country , and the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
Jos@@ hua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them ; as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded .
the children of Israel took all the sp@@ oil of these cities , with the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as sp@@ o@@ ils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave any who bre@@ ath@@ ed .
for it was of Yah@@ we@@ h to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them , that they might have no fav@@ or , but that he might destroy them , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
Jos@@ hua came at that time , and cut off the An@@ ak@@ im from the hill country , from He@@ br@@ on , from De@@ bir , from An@@ a@@ b , and from all the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from all the hill country of Israel : Jos@@ hua ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them with their cities .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and poss@@ essed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sun@@ rise , from the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon , and all the Ara@@ bah eas@@ tw@@ ard :
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba to Di@@ bon ;
their border was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
Mos@@ es gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . it was for the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families .
these are the inher@@ it@@ ances which the children of Israel took in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , distributed to them ,
" now , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has kept me alive , as he spoke , these for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years , from the time that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke this word to Mos@@ es , while Israel walked in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . now , be@@ hold , I am eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the lot for the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea , and passed along by H@@ ez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
the border went up to Beth Ho@@ g@@ lah , and passed along by the north of Beth Ara@@ bah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the border went up to De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En She@@ mes@@ h , and ended at En Ro@@ gel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount J@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
and the border went out to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border extended to Shi@@ k@@ ker@@ on , and passed along to Mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out at J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
to Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h he gave a portion among the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h to Jos@@ hua , even Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba , named after the father of An@@ ak ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the Bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in the mid@@ st of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , all the cities with their villages .
this was the lot for the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph . as for Mac@@ hir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , because he was a man of war , therefore he had G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an .
so this was for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families : for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph according to their families .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of Hep@@ her , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and these are the names of his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : Mah@@ lah , No@@ ah , Ho@@ g@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
the border went down to the Bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the Bro@@ ok . these cities belonged to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was on the north side of the Bro@@ ok , and ended at the sea .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had three he@@ ights in Is@@ sac@@ har , in As@@ her Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced la@@ bor , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
Jos@@ hua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
they shall divide it into seven por@@ tions . Ju@@ da@@ h shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north , and went up through the hill country w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . it ended at the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Beth Av@@ en .
the border passed along from there to L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz ( the same is Be@@ the@@ l ) , sou@@ th@@ ward . the border went down to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Hor@@ on the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter sou@@ th@@ ward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and ended at Kiri@@ ath Ba@@ al ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h . this was the west quarter .
the south quarter was from the far@@ th@@ est part of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im . the border went out w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and went out to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah .
it extended nor@@ th@@ ward , went out at En She@@ mes@@ h , and went out to Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im . it went down to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the border passed along to the side of Beth Ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Sal@@ t Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . this was the south border .
the second lot came out for Simeon , even for the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families . their inher@@ it@@ ance was in the mid@@ st of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h .
out of the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inher@@ it@@ ance in the mid@@ st of their inher@@ it@@ ance .
it turned toward the sun@@ rise to Beth D@@ agon , and reached to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of I@@ ph@@ ta@@ h El nor@@ th@@ ward to Beth E@@ mek and Ne@@ i@@ el . it went out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites . the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , who were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , out of the tri@@ be of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin .
the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an .
the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi ; for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes , even the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
they gave to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with its subur@@ bs , the city of ref@@ uge for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , and Be E@@ sh@@ ter@@ ah with its subur@@ bs ; two cities .

now to the one half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Mos@@ es had given inher@@ it@@ ance in B@@ ash@@ an ; but to the other half gave Jos@@ hua among their brothers beyond the Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . moreover when Jos@@ hua sent them away to their ten@@ ts , he b@@ les@@ sed them ,
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by the Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " be@@ hold , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that per@@ tains to the children of Israel . "
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and with him ten pr@@ inces , one pr@@ ince of a fa@@ thers ' house for each of the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fa@@ thers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
they came to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" thus says the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h , ' What t@@ res@@ pass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Yah@@ we@@ h , in that you have built yo@@ ur@@ selves an alt@@ ar , to rebel this day against Yah@@ we@@ h ?
then the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h answ@@ ered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn away from following Yah@@ we@@ h ; or if to offer bur@@ n@@ t offering or me@@ al offering , or if to offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of peace offer@@ ings , let Yah@@ we@@ h himself require it .
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ?
when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h spoke , it pleased them well .
Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
" therefore be very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left ;
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ selves to them ;
when they cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h , he put d@@ ark@@ ness between you and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and brought the sea on them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt : and you lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness many days .
" ' I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you poss@@ essed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o . the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dro@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; not with your s@@ word , nor with your bo@@ w .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h fought against Jer@@ usalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which is in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and lived with the people .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let the man go and all his family .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth An@@ ath ; but he lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h and of Beth An@@ ath became subject to forced la@@ bor .
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in Mount Her@@ es , in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became subject to forced la@@ bor .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , ' I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you :
it happened , when the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the peoples who were around them , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers who desp@@ o@@ iled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
yet they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to their judges ; for they played the pro@@ stitute after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fa@@ thers walked , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do so .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Yah@@ we@@ h strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
but when the children of Israel cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , Yah@@ we@@ h raised them up a Sav@@ ior , E@@ h@@ ud the son of Ger@@ a , the Benj@@ am@@ ite , a man left @@@ -@@ @ handed . the children of Israel sent tri@@ bute by him to Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b .
now when he was gone out , his servants came ; and they saw , and be@@ hold , the doors of the up@@ per room were locked ; and they said , " su@@ rely he is covering his feet in the up@@ per room . "
they w@@ aited until they were as@@ ha@@ med ; and be@@ hold , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open the doors of the up@@ per room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
it happened , when he had come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
now He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite had separated himself from the Ken@@ ites , even from the children of H@@ ob@@ a@@ b the brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Mos@@ es , and had pit@@ ched his tent as far as the o@@ ak in Za@@ an@@ ann@@ im , which is by K@@ ede@@ sh .
Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the army , to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the army of Sis@@ era fell by the edge of the s@@ word ; there was not a man left .
however Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
Ja@@ el went out to meet Sis@@ era , and said to him , " Tur@@ n in , my lor@@ d , turn in to me ; don '@@ t be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a ru@@ g .
he said to her , " St@@ and in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inqu@@ ires of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
far from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers , in the places of drawing water , there they will re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of Yah@@ we@@ h , the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yah@@ we@@ h went down to the gates .
those whose root is in A@@ mal@@ ek came out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . govern@@ ors come down out of Mac@@ hir . those who handle the mar@@ sh@@ al 's staff came out of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
she put her hand to the tent pe@@ g , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer . with the ham@@ mer she struck Sis@@ era . she struck through his head . yes , she pi@@ er@@ ced and struck through his temp@@ les .
" so let all your enem@@ ies per@@ ish , Yah@@ we@@ h , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest for@@ ty years .
the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel ; and because of Mi@@ dian the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and the c@@ aves , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
for they came up with their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and their ten@@ ts ; they came in as loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; both they and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all who op@@ pressed you , and dro@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said to you , " I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall not fear the go@@ ds of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in whose land you d@@ well . " but you have not list@@ ened to my voice . ' "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
G@@ ide@@ on went in , and prepared a young go@@ at , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of an ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al . he put the meat in a bas@@ ket and he put the bro@@ th in a po@@ t , and brought it out to him under the o@@ ak , and presented it .
and build an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this stron@@ gh@@ old , in an or@@ derly way , and take the second bul@@ l , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken to him : and it happened , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was broken down , and the Ash@@ er@@ ah was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ l was offered on the alt@@ ar that was built .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol on the th@@ res@@ hing floor ; if there is dew on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it is d@@ ry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and en@@ camp@@ ed bes@@ ide the spring of Har@@ od : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " Every@@ one who la@@ ps of the water with his ton@@ gue , like a do@@ g la@@ ps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bo@@ ws down on his k@@ ne@@ es to drink . "
and you shall hear what they say ; and after@@ ward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Pur@@ ah his ser@@ vant to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore for multi@@ tude .
it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and its interpre@@ tation , that he wor@@ shi@@ ped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has delivered the army of Mi@@ dian into your hand ! "
now Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ kor , and their armies with them , about fif@@ teen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
it happened , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the pro@@ stitute after the Ba@@ als , and made Ba@@ al Ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies on every side ;
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the e@@ ars of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hear@@ ts inc@@ lined to follow A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood on the top of Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cri@@ ed , and said to them , " listen to me , you men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may listen to you .
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , sev@@ enty persons , on one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his female ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ) ;
the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set an amb@@ ush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and be@@ hold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and be@@ hold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them at the base of the stron@@ gh@@ old , and set the stron@@ gh@@ old on fire on them ; so that all the people of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the ro@@ of of the to@@ wer .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and served the Ba@@ als , and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of S@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t serve him .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the children of Am@@ mon .
the people , the pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain fel@@ lows to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to get J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b ;
the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , " T@@ her@@ e@@ fore we have turned again to you now , that you may go with us , and fight with the children of Am@@ mon ; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
while Israel lived in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and its towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Ar@@ non , three hundred years ; why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you rec@@ over them within that time ?
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , it shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering . "
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may de@@ part and go down on the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my compan@@ ions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she was a vir@@ gin . it was a cust@@ om in Israel ,
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were gathered together , and passed nor@@ th@@ ward ; and they said to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , " Wh@@ y did you pass over to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t call us to go with you ? we will bur@@ n your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
for , be@@ hold , you shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son ; and no ra@@ zor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Naz@@ ir@@ ite to God from the w@@ om@@ b : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to Man@@ o@@ ah , " Th@@ ough you de@@ tain me , I won '@@ t eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering , you must offer it to Yah@@ we@@ h . " for Man@@ o@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that he was the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h .
for it happened , when the fla@@ me went up toward the sky from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar : and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on him , and he t@@ ore him as he would have torn a young go@@ at ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell his father or his mother what he had done .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing gra@@ in of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks and the standing gra@@ in , and also the olive gro@@ ves .
they said to him , " We have come down to bin@@ d you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . " Sam@@ son said to them , " swe@@ ar to me that you will not fall on me yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ram@@ ath Leh@@ i .
she said , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are upon you , Sam@@ son ! " he aw@@ oke out of his sle@@ ep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that Yah@@ we@@ h had depar@@ ted from him .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered our enemy and the destro@@ yer of our country , who has sla@@ in many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , " C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may enter@@ tain us . " they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pil@@ lars ;
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were on the ro@@ of about three thousand men and women , who saw while Sam@@ son performed .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an en@@ gra@@ ved image and a m@@ ol@@ ten image : and it was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
the man depar@@ ted out of the city , out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he trav@@ eled .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes sought an inher@@ it@@ ance to d@@ well in ; for to that day , their inher@@ it@@ ance had not fallen to them among the tri@@ bes of Israel .
they said , " arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and be@@ hold , it is very good . do you stand still ? D@@ on '@@ t be slo@@ th@@ ful to go and to enter in to poss@@ ess the land .
the six hundred men gir@@ t with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when they were a good way from the house of Mic@@ ah , the men who were in the houses near to Mic@@ ah 's house were gathered together , and over@@ took the children of Dan .
the children of Dan said to him , " D@@ on '@@ t let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fel@@ lows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
they took that which Mic@@ ah had made , and the pri@@ est whom he had , and came to La@@ ish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the s@@ word ; and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the en@@ gra@@ ved image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Mos@@ es , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
it happened in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Lev@@ ite living on the far@@ ther side of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , who took to him a conc@@ ub@@ ine out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h .
it happened on the fourth day , that they ar@@ ose early in the morning , and he rose up to de@@ part : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to his son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Str@@ eng@@ then your heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and d@@ rank , both of them together : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to the man , " P@@ le@@ ase be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
but the man wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stay that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus ( the same is Jer@@ usalem ) : and there were with him a couple of don@@ ke@@ ys s@@ add@@ led ; his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said to his master , " P@@ le@@ ase come and let us turn aside into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lo@@ dge .
be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " W@@ here are you going ? where did you come from ? "
yet there is both stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for our don@@ ke@@ ys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your hand@@ ma@@ id , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " G@@ et up , and let us be going ! " but no one answ@@ ered . then he took her up on the don@@ key ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
when he had come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , lim@@ b by lim@@ b , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fel@@ lows , who are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
the children of Israel ar@@ ose , and went up to Be@@ the@@ l , and asked coun@@ sel of God ; and they said , " Wh@@ o shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? " Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Ju@@ da@@ h first . "
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came to Be@@ the@@ l , and we@@ pt , and sat there before Yah@@ we@@ h , and fas@@ ted that day until evening ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they tr@@ usted the amb@@ ush@@ ers whom they had set against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
but when the cl@@ oud began to arise up out of the city in a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them ; and be@@ hold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its mid@@ st .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , both the entire city , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
they said , " be@@ hold , there is a feast of Yah@@ we@@ h from year to year in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is on the north of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of L@@ eb@@ on@@ ah . "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of those who dan@@ ced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inher@@ it@@ ance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel depar@@ ted there at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that Yah@@ we@@ h had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
go back , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband ton@@ ight , and should also bear sons ;
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said to him , " Wh@@ y have I found fav@@ or in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreig@@ ner ? "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
now , my daughter , don '@@ t be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a wor@@ thy woman .
Bo@@ az said to the el@@ ders , and to all the people , " You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's , and all that was Ch@@ il@@ ion 's and Mah@@ lon 's , from the hand of Na@@ om@@ i .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim Z@@ op@@ him , of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of To@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite :
when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ ls , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h . the child was young .
those who strive with Yah@@ we@@ h shall be broken to pieces . he will Th@@ under against them in the sky . " Yah@@ we@@ h will judge the ends of the ear@@ th . he will give strength to his king , and ex@@ alt the Hor@@ n of his ano@@ in@@ ted . "
now E@@ li was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ in@@ ted fore@@ ver .
it happened at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
so the people sent to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h ; and they brought from there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who s@@ its above the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m : and the two sons of E@@ li , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , were there with the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out , they said , " What does the no@@ ise of this great sh@@ out in the camp of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws mean ? " they understood that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h had come into the camp .
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer , neither did she regard it .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the next day , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against the city with a very great conf@@ usion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and t@@ um@@ ors broke out on them .
therefore you shall make images of your t@@ um@@ ors , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and you shall give gl@@ ory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
the co@@ ws took the stra@@ ight way by the way to Beth She@@ mes@@ h ; they went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them to the border of Beth She@@ mes@@ h .
they of Beth She@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the c@@ art , and offered up the co@@ ws for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , in which the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth She@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day to Yah@@ we@@ h .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " D@@ on '@@ t ce@@ ase to cry to Yah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and they shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots ;
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your don@@ ke@@ ys , and put them to his work .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , the son of a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or .
he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant who was with him , " C@@ ome , and let us return , lest my father stop car@@ ing about the don@@ ke@@ ys , and be anx@@ ious for us . "
( in earlier times in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he said , " C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er " ; for he who is now called a pro@@ phe@@ t was before called a Se@@ er . )
as for your don@@ ke@@ ys who were lost three days ago , don '@@ t set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desi@@ ra@@ ble in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
they ar@@ ose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Sa@@ ul on the hous@@ et@@ op , saying , " G@@ et up , that I may send you away . " Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , be@@ hold , he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied with the pro@@ ph@@ ets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of K@@ ish ? is Sa@@ ul also among the pro@@ ph@@ ets ? "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the mes@@ sen@@ gers came to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and spoke these words in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
they said to the mes@@ sen@@ gers who came , " Th@@ us you shall tell the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , ' Tom@@ orrow , by the time the sun is hot , you shall have deliver@@ ance . ' " the mes@@ sen@@ gers came and told the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h ; and they were glad .
" but they for@@ got Yah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b ; and they fought against them .
they cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , ' We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , and have served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enem@@ ies , and we will serve you . '
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines assemb@@ led themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ se@@ men , and people as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore in multi@@ tude : and they came up , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , eas@@ tw@@ ard of Beth Av@@ en .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it ( for the people were dist@@ ressed ) , then the people hi@@ d themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in cover@@ ts , and in p@@ its .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might gre@@ et him .
but now your k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue . Yah@@ we@@ h has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed him to be pr@@ ince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded you . "
the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , to the land of Sh@@ ual ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said to the young man who b@@ ore his arm@@ or , " C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . " but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell his father .
between the passes , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the one side , and a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a fur@@ row 's length in an ac@@ re of land .
Sa@@ ul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow : a very great conf@@ usion .
now the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jon@@ athan di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear when his father comman@@ ded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d who was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
and the people fle@@ w on the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and c@@ attle , and cal@@ ves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now when Sa@@ ul had taken the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , he fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and wher@@ ever he turned himself , he defeated them .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua ; and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az . the name of the captain of his army was Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
" it gri@@ ev@@ es me that I have set up Sa@@ ul to be king ; for he is turned back from following me , and has not performed my comman@@ d@@ ments . " Samuel was angry ; and he cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h all night .
Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and be@@ hold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to G@@ ilg@@ al . "
he had a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he was cla@@ d with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul , stric@@ ken among men .
the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se had gone after Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
David said , " Yah@@ we@@ h who delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . " Sa@@ ul said to David , " G@@ o ; and Yah@@ we@@ h shall be with you . "
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in his wal@@ let . his s@@ ling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and s@@ lun@@ g it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head ; and the stone san@@ k into his fore@@ head , and he fell on his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of its she@@ ath , and killed him , and cut off his head there@@ with . when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ar@@ ose , and sh@@ ou@@ ted , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , until you come to G@@ ai , and to the gates of E@@ kr@@ on . the wounded of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fell down by the way to Sha@@ ar@@ aim , even to G@@ ath , and to E@@ kr@@ on .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clo@@ thing , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his s@@ ash .
it happened on the next day , that an ev@@ il spirit from God came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on Sa@@ ul , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the mid@@ st of the house . David played with his hand , as he did day by day . Sa@@ ul had his spe@@ ar in his hand ;
Sa@@ ul 's servants spoke those words in the e@@ ars of David . David said , " Do@@ es it seems to you a light thing to be the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , since I am a poor man , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed ? "
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it happened , as often as they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was highly es@@ te@@ emed .
Sa@@ ul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spe@@ ar ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he st@@ uck the spe@@ ar into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Sa@@ ul sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Mic@@ hal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don '@@ t save your life ton@@ ight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
therefore deal kin@@ dly with your ser@@ vant ; for you have brought your ser@@ vant into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h with you : but if there is in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in me , kill me yo@@ ur@@ self ; for why should you bring me to your father ? "
but also you shall not cut off your kin@@ d@@ ness from my house fore@@ ver ; no , not when Yah@@ we@@ h has cut off the enem@@ ies of David everyone from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th . "
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hi@@ d yo@@ ur@@ self when this started , and shall remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jon@@ athan stood up , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
as soon as the boy was gone , David ar@@ ose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bo@@ wed himself three times . they k@@ is@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , and David we@@ pt the most .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g the E@@ dom@@ ite , the best of the her@@ d@@ s@@ men who belonged to Sa@@ ul .
the servants of A@@ ch@@ ish said to him , " Is@@ n '@@ t this David the king of the land ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t they sing one to another about him in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
everyone who was in dist@@ ress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was dis@@ conten@@ ted , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Sa@@ ul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Sa@@ ul was sitting in Gi@@ be@@ ah , under the tam@@ ar@@ is@@ k tree in Ram@@ ah , with his spe@@ ar in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
he struck No@@ b , the city of the pri@@ ests , with the edge of the s@@ word , both men and women , children and nur@@ sing ba@@ bies , and c@@ attle and don@@ ke@@ ys and she@@ ep , with the edge of the s@@ word .
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , ar@@ ose and depar@@ ted out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went wher@@ ever they could go . it was told Sa@@ ul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he gave up going there .
then the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes came up to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , " Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t David hide himself with us in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of the de@@ sert ?
now therefore , O king , come down , according to all the desire of your sou@@ l to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king 's hand . "
Sa@@ ul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
Sa@@ ul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made has@@ te to get away for fear of Sa@@ ul ; for Sa@@ ul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them .
it happened , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , " be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En Ge@@ di . "
so David checked his men with these words , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow them to rise against Sa@@ ul . Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also ar@@ ose after@@ ward , and went out of the cave , and cri@@ ed after Sa@@ ul , saying , " My lor@@ d the king ! " when Sa@@ ul looked behind him , David bo@@ wed with his face to the ear@@ th , and showed respect .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
swe@@ ar now therefore to me by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
now I have heard that you have s@@ hear@@ ers . your she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds have now been with us , and we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hurt them , neither was there anything missing from them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
ask your young men , and they will tell you . therefore let the young men find fav@@ or in your eyes ; for we come in a good day . ple@@ ase give whatever comes to your hand , to your servants , and to your son David . ' "
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it to men who I don '@@ t know where they come from ? "
it was so , as she ro@@ de on her don@@ key , and came down by the cover@@ t of the mountain , that be@@ hold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
ple@@ ase for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of your hand@@ ma@@ id . for Yah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house , because my lor@@ d fights the batt@@ les of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and ev@@ il shall not be found in you all your days .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your sou@@ l , yet the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with Yah@@ we@@ h your God . he will s@@ ling out the so@@ ul@@ s of your enem@@ ies , as from the hol@@ low of a s@@ ling .
it shall come to pass , when Yah@@ we@@ h has done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you pr@@ ince over Israel ,
that this shall be no gri@@ ef to you , nor offen@@ se of heart to my lor@@ d , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lor@@ d has av@@ en@@ ged himself . when Yah@@ we@@ h has dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember your hand@@ ma@@ id . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " G@@ o up in peace to your house . be@@ hold , I have list@@ ened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
Sa@@ ul en@@ camp@@ ed in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before the de@@ sert , by the way . but David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had en@@ camp@@ ed ; and David saw the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his army : and Sa@@ ul lay within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , and the people were en@@ camp@@ ed around him .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul lay sle@@ eping within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , with his spe@@ ar st@@ uck in the ground at his head ; and Ab@@ ner and the people lay around him .
now therefore , don '@@ t let my blood fall to the ear@@ th away from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one hun@@ ts a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains . "
David lived with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
David struck the land , and sav@@ ed neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the c@@ attle , and the don@@ ke@@ ys , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the clo@@ thing ; and he returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
it happened in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . A@@ ch@@ ish said to David , " K@@ now assu@@ red@@ ly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . Sa@@ ul had put away those who had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
the woman said to him , " be@@ hold , you know what Sa@@ ul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land . why then do you lay a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ? "
Yah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom out of your hand , and given it to your neigh@@ bor , even to David .
then Sa@@ ul fell immediately his full length on the ear@@ th , and was ter@@ ri@@ fied , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
the woman came to Sa@@ ul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " be@@ hold , your hand@@ ma@@ id has list@@ ened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have list@@ ened to your words which you spoke to me .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lor@@ d who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part . "
it happened , when David and his men had come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had made a raid on the South , and on Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and had struck Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ,
when David and his men came to the city , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins@@ . when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
David struck them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who ro@@ de on ca@@ me@@ ls and fled .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tar@@ ries by the bag@@ g@@ age : they shall share alike . "
and to those who were in R@@ ac@@ al , and to those who were in the cities of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and to those who were in the cities of the Ken@@ ites ,
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth S@@ han ; and they came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
it happened on the third day , that be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul , with his clo@@ th@@ es torn , and ear@@ th on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and showed respect .
David said to him , " Ho@@ w did it go ? ple@@ ase tell me . " he answ@@ ered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul was le@@ an@@ ing on his spe@@ ar ; and be@@ hold , the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men followed hard after him .
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until evening , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( and he comman@@ ded them to te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the song of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ har ) :
the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . they told David , saying , " The men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad were those who buried Sa@@ ul . "
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " b@@ les@@ sed are you by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kin@@ d@@ ness to your lor@@ d , even to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
now then do it ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my ser@@ vant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies . ' "
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
when Jo@@ a@@ b and all the army who was with him had come , they told Jo@@ a@@ b , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into f@@ et@@ ters . as a man falls before the children of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , so you fell . " all the people we@@ pt again over him .
in times past , when Sa@@ ul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h said to you , ' You shall be she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of my people Israel , and you shall be pr@@ ince over Israel . ' "
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall stir yo@@ ur@@ self up ; for then Yah@@ we@@ h has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
so David would not move the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
it was so , as the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
he gave to all the people , even among the whole multi@@ tude of Israel , both to men and women , to everyone a portion of bread , dates , and ra@@ is@@ ins . so all the people depar@@ ted everyone to his house .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you went , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sle@@ ep with your fa@@ thers , I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall proceed out of your bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
he struck Mo@@ a@@ b , and meas@@ ured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he meas@@ ured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Mo@@ abi@@ tes became servants to David , and brought tri@@ bute .
then Z@@ ib@@ a said to the king , " Accor@@ ding to all that my lor@@ d the king comman@@ ds his ser@@ vant , so your shall ser@@ vant do . " so M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they were become odi@@ ous to David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syri@@ ans of Beth Re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah with one thousand men , and the men of To@@ b twelve thousand men .
the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and the men of To@@ b and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened at evening , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked on the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman ba@@ thing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
when they had told David , saying , " U@@ ri@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house , " David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you come from a journey ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him dr@@ un@@ k . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lor@@ d , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
it shall be that , if the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he asks you , ' Wh@@ y did you go so near to the city to fight ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you know that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wi@@ ves into your bos@@ om , and gave you the house of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
why have you desp@@ ised the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , to do that which is ev@@ il in his sight ? you have struck U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te with the s@@ word , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have sla@@ in him with the s@@ word of the children of Am@@ mon .
" this is what Yah@@ we@@ h says : ' be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wi@@ ves before your eyes , and give them to your neigh@@ bor , and he will lie with your wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
he took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a tal@@ ent of gold , and in it were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
so Am@@ non lay down and fak@@ ed being si@@ ck . when the king came to see him , Am@@ non said to the king , " P@@ le@@ ase let my sister Tam@@ ar come , and make me a couple of cak@@ es in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . "
so Tam@@ ar went to her brother Am@@ non 's house ; and he was laid down . she took d@@ ough , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and made cak@@ es in his sight , and bak@@ ed the cak@@ es .
she had a gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors on her ; for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who were vir@@ g@@ ins d@@ ressed . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and t@@ ore her gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , cr@@ ying al@@ oud as she went .
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man got up on his mul@@ e , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , many people were coming by way of the hil@@ l@@ side behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt . the king also and all his servants we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his ser@@ vant . '
then your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' P@@ le@@ ase let the word of my lor@@ d the king bring rest ; for as an an@@ gel of God , so is my lor@@ d the king to dis@@ cer@@ n good and bad . May Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , be with you . ' "
Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and b@@ les@@ sed the king . Jo@@ a@@ b said , " Today your ser@@ vant knows that I have found fav@@ or in your sight , my lor@@ d , king , in that the king has performed the request of his ser@@ vant . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
when he cut the ha@@ ir of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els , after the king 's weight .
all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men who came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
be@@ hold , Zad@@ ok also came , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God ; and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
David went up by the as@@ cent of the Mount of ol@@ ives , and we@@ pt as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was wor@@ shi@@ ped , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at torn , and ear@@ th on his head .
D@@ on '@@ t you have Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az , Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan , A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul came out , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a . he came out , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t ; for all Israel knows that your father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there is@@ n '@@ t one small stone found there . "
Ab@@ sal@@ om and all the men of Israel said , " The coun@@ sel of Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite is better than the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el . " for Yah@@ we@@ h had or@@ da@@ ined to defeat the good coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , to the intent that Yah@@ we@@ h might bring ev@@ il on Ab@@ sal@@ om .
then David ar@@ ose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there la@@ cked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his don@@ key , and ar@@ ose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and han@@ ged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
Ab@@ sal@@ om set A@@ masa over the army instead of Jo@@ a@@ b . now A@@ masa was the son of a man , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra the Isra@@ elite , who went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
then Jo@@ a@@ b said , " I 'm not going to wait like this with you . " he took three dar@@ ts in his hand , and th@@ rust them through the heart of Ab@@ sal@@ om , while he was yet alive in the mid@@ st of the o@@ ak .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , a man running alone .
Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , " You have sha@@ med this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have sav@@ ed your life , and the lives of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of your wi@@ ves , and the lives of your conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your ser@@ vant knows that I have sin@@ ned . therefore be@@ hold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king . "
M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul came down to meet the king ; and he had neither gro@@ o@@ med his feet , nor tri@@ m@@ med his be@@ ard , nor was@@ hed his clo@@ th@@ es , from the day the king depar@@ ted until the day he came home in peace .
there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men ; and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of Yah@@ we@@ h 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , whom she b@@ ore to Sa@@ ul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ; and the five sons of Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul , whom she b@@ ore to Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , and they han@@ ged them in the mountain before Yah@@ we@@ h , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of har@@ v@@ est , in the first days , at the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
they buried the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son in the country of Benjamin in Z@@ ela , in the tomb of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . after that God was ent@@ re@@ ated for the land .
David spoke to Yah@@ we@@ h the words of this song in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
in my dist@@ ress I called on Yah@@ we@@ h . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le . my cry came into his e@@ ars .
you also have delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enem@@ ies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds , when the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ ings out of the ear@@ th , through clear sh@@ ining after rain . '
after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of len@@ ti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the three m@@ igh@@ ty men broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a good@@ ly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and p@@ lu@@ cked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spe@@ ar .
the king said to Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army , who was with him , " Now go back and forth through all the tri@@ bes of Israel , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and number the people , that I may know the sum of the people . "
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the army . Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men who drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
therefore his servants said to him , " Let there be sought for my lor@@ d the king a young vir@@ gin . let her stand before the king , and ch@@ er@@ ish him ; and let her lie in your bos@@ om , that my lor@@ d the king may keep warm . "
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men who belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you , my lor@@ d , king , swe@@ ar to your hand@@ ma@@ id , saying , As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my th@@ r@@ one ? why then does Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah reign ? '
he has sla@@ in c@@ attle and fat@@ lings and she@@ ep in ab@@ und@@ ance , and has called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army ; but he has@@ n '@@ t called Solomon your ser@@ vant .
they told the king , saying , " be@@ hold , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t ! " when he had come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
most certainly as I s@@ wor@@ e to you by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , ' As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my th@@ r@@ one in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my th@@ r@@ one ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be pr@@ ince over Israel and over Ju@@ da@@ h . "
so Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mul@@ e , and brought him to G@@ ih@@ on .
the king has sent with him Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mul@@ e .
moreover the king 's servants came to b@@ less our lor@@ d king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his th@@ r@@ one greater than your th@@ r@@ one ; ' and the king bo@@ wed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my th@@ r@@ one this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
so shall their blood return on the head of Jo@@ a@@ b , and on the head of his se@@ ed fore@@ ver . but to David , and to his se@@ ed , and to his house , and to his th@@ r@@ one , there shall be peace fore@@ ver from Yah@@ we@@ h . "
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , know for certain that you shall su@@ rely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away to A@@ ch@@ ish , son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah , king of G@@ ath . they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , " be@@ hold , your servants are in G@@ ath . "
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
when I rose in the morning to nur@@ se my child , be@@ hold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , whom I b@@ ore . "
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
Ben Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ( to him belonged the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; to him belonged the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in B@@ ash@@ an , six@@ ty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri , in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
for he had domin@@ ion over all on this side the River , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
he spoke of trees , from the c@@ ed@@ ar that is in Lebanon even to the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p that spr@@ ings out of the wall ; he spoke also of animals , and of birds , and of cre@@ eping things , and of fish .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
it happened in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zi@@ v , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the ne@@ ther@@ most story was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; for on the outside he made off@@ sets in the wall of the house all around , that the be@@ ams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quar@@ ry ; and there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ce@@ iling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of f@@ ir .
five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m within the in@@ ner house ; and the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were stret@@ ched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
so he made two doors of olive wood ; and he car@@ ved on them car@@ v@@ ings of ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m and pal@@ m trees and open flowers , and over@@ laid them with gold ; and he spread the gold on the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , and on the pal@@ m trees .
in the ele@@ venth year , in the month B@@ ul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
his house where he was to d@@ well , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
he made two capitals of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set on the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
there were n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pil@@ lars , close by the bel@@ ly which was bes@@ ide the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred , in ro@@ ws around on the other capital .
he set up the pil@@ lars at the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
the four whe@@ els were under@@ ne@@ ath the pan@@ els ; and the ax@@ les of the whe@@ els were in the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and half a cu@@ bit .
the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ les , and their ri@@ ms , and their spok@@ es , and their nav@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard , toward the south .
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the c@@ ups , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , of the temp@@ le , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
they brought up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; even these the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , who were assemb@@ led to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h to its place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k except the two tables of stone which Mos@@ es put there at Ho@@ re@@ b , when Yah@@ we@@ h made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
there I have set a place for the Ar@@ k , in which is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and for his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you this day ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant shall pra@@ y toward this place .
listen to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place . yes , hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
then hear in heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head , and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ lic@@ t them :
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and of your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ) ; when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall rep@@ ent in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of those who carried them cap@@ tive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely ; we have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their enem@@ ies , who carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y to you toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and for@@ give your people who have sin@@ ned against you , and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions in which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against you ; and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before those who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread forth toward heav@@ en .
" b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
let these my words , with which I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h , be near to Yah@@ we@@ h our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , to do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel fore@@ ver , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and my stat@@ utes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made hol@@ y for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and that which Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people who were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the H@@ itti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
she came to Jer@@ usalem with a very great train , with ca@@ me@@ ls that b@@ ore sp@@ ices , and very much gold , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones ; and when she had come to Solomon , she talked with him of all that was in her heart .
besides that which the tr@@ aders brought , and the traffic of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty ; and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
therefore Yah@@ we@@ h said to Solomon , " Bec@@ ause this is done by you , and you have not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded you , I will su@@ rely tear the k@@ ing@@ dom from you , and will give it to your ser@@ vant .
however I will not tear away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but I will give one tri@@ be to your son , for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an ; and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " Let me de@@ part , that I may go to my own country . "
it happened at that time , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field .
( but he shall have one tri@@ be , for my ser@@ vant David 's sake and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel ) ;
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a ser@@ vant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants fore@@ ver . "
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
so the king di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he might establish his word , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was returned , that they sent and called him to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
if this people goes up to offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lor@@ d , even to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they will kill me , and return to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h . "
now there lived an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
for it was said to me by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
and he cri@@ ed to the man of God who came from Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' Bec@@ ause you have been dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment which Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you ,
but came back , and have e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fa@@ thers . ' "
it happened , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led the don@@ key for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the don@@ key stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t lived .
the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old pro@@ phe@@ t to mour@@ n , and to bur@@ y him .
it happened , after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons , saying , " When I am dead , then bur@@ y me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried . lay my b@@ ones bes@@ ide his b@@ ones .
for the saying which he cri@@ ed by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h against the alt@@ ar in Be@@ the@@ l , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samar@@ ia , will su@@ rely happen . "
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and ar@@ ose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . now A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and t@@ ore the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done ev@@ il above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . " '
the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
he brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha struck him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel were lay@@ ing siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
for the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provoc@@ ation with which he provoked Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
" because I ex@@ al@@ ted you out of the d@@ ust , and made you pr@@ ince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and have made my people Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with their sin@@ s ;
the do@@ gs will eat Ba@@ as@@ ha 's des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he struck all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave him a single one who ur@@ in@@ ates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
the people who were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri has consp@@ ired , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
it happened , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sin@@ s which he sin@@ ned in doing that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , in walk@@ ing in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he committed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin@@ s with which he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he showed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ eighth year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel in Samar@@ ia twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years .
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took as wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
Eli@@ j@@ ah said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little c@@ ake first , and bring it out to me , and after@@ ward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' The j@@ ar of me@@ al shall not empty , neither shall the j@@ ar of oil fail , until the day that Yah@@ we@@ h sends rain on the ear@@ th . ' "
it happened after these things , that the son of the woman , the mist@@ ress of the house , fell si@@ ck ; and his si@@ ck@@ ness was so severe , that there was no bre@@ ath left in him .
Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , " be@@ hold , your son lives . "
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Yah@@ we@@ h , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took one hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ l in pieces , and laid it on the wood . he said , " fill four j@@ ars with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and on the wood . "
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he bo@@ wed himself down on the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es .
when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . be@@ hold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el , J@@ eh@@ u will kill ; and he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u , E@@ lis@@ ha will kill .
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleas@@ ant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
then he mu@@ ster@@ ed the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two . after them , he mu@@ ster@@ ed all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Had@@ ad mu@@ ster@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
as your ser@@ vant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " S@@ o your judgment shall be ; you yo@@ ur@@ self have decided it . "
so she wrote letters in A@@ ha@@ b 's name , and sealed them with his se@@ al , and sent the letters to the el@@ ders and to the no@@ bles who were in his city , who lived with Nab@@ o@@ th .
the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who lived in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , who d@@ wel@@ ls in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , he is in the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on you , and will ut@@ ter@@ ly swe@@ ep you away and will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah for the provoc@@ ation with which you have provoked me to an@@ ger , and have made Israel to sin . "
now the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h were sitting each on his th@@ r@@ one , ar@@ ray@@ ed in their rob@@ es , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets were pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying before them .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " su@@ rely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bo@@ w at ran@@ dom , and struck the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the arm@@ or . therefore he said to the driver of his char@@ i@@ ot , " Tur@@ n your hand , and carry me out of the battle ; for I am severely wounded . "
they was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot by the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood where the pro@@ stitu@@ tes was@@ hed themselves ; according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he walked in all the way of A@@ SA his father ; He di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he showed , and how he war@@ red , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , in which he made Israel to sin .
but the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to Eli@@ j@@ ah the T@@ ish@@ bi@@ te , " arise , go up to meet the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the king of Samar@@ ia , and tell them , ' Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you go to inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al Ze@@ bu@@ b , the go@@ d of E@@ kr@@ on ?
then the king sent a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty to him . he went up to him ; and be@@ hold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' C@@ ome down ! ' "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that be@@ hold , a char@@ i@@ ot of fire and hor@@ ses of fire separated them ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
E@@ lis@@ ha saw it , and he cri@@ ed , " My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ se@@ men ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clo@@ th@@ es , and t@@ ore them in two pieces .
he took the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and struck the waters , and said , " W@@ here is Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Eli@@ j@@ ah ? " when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and E@@ lis@@ ha went over .
when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah rests on E@@ lis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
he went up from there to Be@@ the@@ l . as he was going up by the way , some you@@ ths came out of the city and mo@@ cked him , and said to him , " G@@ o up , you bal@@ dy ! go up , you bal@@ d@@ head ! "
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the king of E@@ dom ; and they made a cir@@ cu@@ it of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and your animals .
now when all the Mo@@ abi@@ tes heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on arm@@ or , and up@@ ward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one on the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew s@@ word , to break through to the king of E@@ dom ; but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son who would have re@@ ig@@ ned in his place , and offered him for a bur@@ n@@ t offering on the wall . there was great wr@@ ath against Israel : and they depar@@ ted from him , and returned to their own land .
it fell on a day , that E@@ lis@@ ha passed to Sh@@ un@@ em , where there was a prominent woman ; and she persu@@ aded him to eat bread . so it was , that as often as he passed by , he turned in there to eat bread .
ple@@ ase let us make a little room on the wall . let us set for him there a bed , a table , a chair , and a lam@@ p stand . it shall be , when he comes to us , that he shall turn in there . "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his m@@ outh on his m@@ outh , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stret@@ ched himself on him ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child grew warm .
E@@ lis@@ ha came again to G@@ ilg@@ al . there was a fam@@ ine in the land ; and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets were sitting before him ; and he said to his ser@@ vant , " S@@ et on the great po@@ t , and bo@@ il ste@@ w for the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . "
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were e@@ ating of the ste@@ w , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the po@@ t ! " they could not eat of it .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and hon@@ or@@ able , because by him Yah@@ we@@ h had given victory to Syria : he was also a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or , but he was a le@@ per .
someone went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , " The ma@@ iden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , be@@ hold , I have sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to you , that you may he@@ al him of his le@@ pro@@ sy . "
it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , " Wh@@ y have you torn your clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel . "
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his f@@ les@@ h was restored like the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
it happened , when they had come into Samar@@ ia , that E@@ lis@@ ha said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Yah@@ we@@ h opened their eyes , and they saw ; and be@@ hold , they were in the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia .
there was a great fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , until a don@@ key 's head was sold for eigh@@ ty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a ka@@ b of do@@ ve 's D@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th under@@ ne@@ ath on his f@@ les@@ h .
they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go to the camp of the Syri@@ ans . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syri@@ ans , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
the woman ar@@ ose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
it happened at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
it happened on the next day , that he took a th@@ ick clo@@ th , di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Haz@@ a@@ el re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife . he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
when you come there , find J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an in@@ ner room .
then take the vi@@ al of oil , and p@@ our it on his head , and say , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I have ano@@ in@@ ted you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don '@@ t wait . "
he ar@@ ose , and went into the house . then he p@@ oured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' I have ano@@ in@@ ted you king over the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of A@@ ha@@ b your master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of Yah@@ we@@ h , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish . I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent them to him to J@@ ez@@ reel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righ@@ te@@ ous . be@@ hold , I consp@@ ired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
when he came to Samar@@ ia , he struck all who remained to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel ; and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was filled from one end to another .
however from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from after them , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but J@@ eh@@ u took no heed to walk in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
you shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the cap@@ tains over hundreds did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains over hundreds the spe@@ ars and shi@@ elds that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Br@@ ing her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the s@@ word . " for the pri@@ est said , " D@@ on '@@ t let her be sla@@ in in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the hor@@ ses ' entry to the king 's house . she was sla@@ in there .
all the people of the land went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images broke they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he took the cap@@ tains over hundreds , and the Car@@ ites , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est took a ch@@ est , and bo@@ red a hol@@ e in its li@@ d , and set it bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and the pri@@ ests who kept the threshold put there@@ in all the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they paid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and the buil@@ ders , who worked on the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
and to the mas@@ ons and the stone cut@@ ters , and for buying tim@@ ber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h c@@ ups of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ins , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from it .

now E@@ lis@@ ha was fallen si@@ ck of his si@@ ck@@ ness of which he died : and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down to him , and we@@ pt over him , and said , " My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ se@@ men ! "
it happened , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band ; and they cast the man into the tomb of E@@ lis@@ ha : and as soon as the man touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
it happened , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had sla@@ in the king his father :
Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and came to Jer@@ usalem , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .

twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th P@@ il@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , " I am your ser@@ vant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
when the king had come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king drew near to the alt@@ ar , and offered on it .
the bronze alt@@ ar , which was before Yah@@ we@@ h , he brought from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between his alt@@ ar and the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and put it on the north side of his alt@@ ar .
King A@@ haz cut off the pan@@ els of the bases , and removed the bas@@ in from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze ox@@ en that were under it , and put it on a pav@@ ement of stone .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and had fear@@ ed other go@@ ds ,
the children of Israel did secre@@ tly things that were not right against Yah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the for@@ ti@@ fied city ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , they would not listen , but har@@ dened their nec@@ k , like the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe in Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
they caused their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and en@@ chan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ va , and from Ham@@ ath and Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel ; and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and lived in the cities of it .
so it was , at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore Yah@@ we@@ h sent li@@ ons among them , which killed some of them .
but you shall fear Yah@@ we@@ h , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and you shall bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to him , and you shall sacrifice to him .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pil@@ lars , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah : and he broke in pieces the bronze ser@@ p@@ ent that Mos@@ es had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned incen@@ se to it ; and he called it Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ tan .
it happened in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des ,
at that time , H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great army to Jer@@ usalem . they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
you say ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) , ' There is coun@@ sel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebel@@ led against me ?
now , be@@ hold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even in Egypt . if a man le@@ ans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it . so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , ple@@ ase give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , came with She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
they said to him , " Th@@ us says H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , ' This day is a day of trouble , of re@@ bu@@ ke , and of rejection ; for the children have come to the point of birth , and there is no strength to deliver them .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , Jer@@ usalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den that were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah pray@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who sit above the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , you are the God , even you alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th . you have made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Yah@@ we@@ h our God , save us , I be@@ g you , out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that you , Yah@@ we@@ h , are God alone . "
ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to lay waste for@@ ti@@ fied cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded . they were like the gr@@ ass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like gra@@ in b@@ lasted before it has grown up .
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
" ' this shall be the sign to you : you shall eat this year that which gro@@ ws of itself , and in the second year that which spr@@ ings of the same ; and in the third year so@@ w , and re@@ ap , and plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and eat its fruit .
" therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , ' He shall not come to this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mo@@ und against it .
it happened that night , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out , and struck one hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , before I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying ,
I will add to your days fif@@ teen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake . " ' "
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing shall be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ O@@ f your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on . ' "
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
for he built again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , as did A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
he made his son to pass through the fire , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
because they have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Am@@ on was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty @@@ -@@ @ one years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Boz@@ kat@@ h .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , which the ke@@ epers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Y@@ our servants have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who have the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has read .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' "
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : ' concerning the words which you have heard ,
'@@ T@@ her@@ e@@ fore be@@ hold , I will gather you to your fa@@ thers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the ev@@ il which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
he brought out the Ash@@ er@@ ah from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , outside of Jer@@ usalem , to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and beat it to d@@ ust , and cast its d@@ ust on the graves of the common people .
moreover the alt@@ ar that was at Be@@ the@@ l , and the high place which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that alt@@ ar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to d@@ ust , and burned the Ash@@ er@@ ah .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yah@@ we@@ h with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , with which his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
Yah@@ we@@ h sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
the king of Egypt di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had taken , from the Bro@@ ok of Egypt to the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , as Yah@@ we@@ h had said .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to Jer@@ usalem .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke up the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and carried the br@@ ass pieces to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the captain of the guard took away the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
as for the people who were left in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , governor .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ite , they and their men .
but it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the royal se@@ ed came , and ten men with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
it happened in the seven and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the cap@@ tivity of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , on the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , that E@@ vil@@ mer@@ od@@ ach king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h out of prison ;
and for his allow@@ ance , there was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .
Jok@@ tan became the father of Al@@ mo@@ dad , and She@@ le@@ p@@ h , and H@@ azar@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Jer@@ ah ,
now these are the kings who re@@ ig@@ ned in the land of E@@ dom , before there re@@ ig@@ ned any king over the children of Israel : Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or ; and the name of his city was Din@@ ha@@ bah .
now these were the sons of David , who were born to him in He@@ br@@ on : the fir@@ st@@ born , Am@@ non , of Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s ; the second , Daniel , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s ;
the sons of She@@ lah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h : E@@ R the father of L@@ ec@@ ah , and La@@ ad@@ ah the father of Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h , and the families of the house of those who worked fine lin@@ en , of the house of Ash@@ be@@ a ;
some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to Mount Se@@ ir , having for their cap@@ tains Pe@@ la@@ ti@@ ah , and N@@ ear@@ i@@ ah , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , the sons of I@@ sh@@ i .
these were the sons of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il , the son of Hur@@ i , the son of Jar@@ o@@ ah , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Michael , the son of J@@ es@@ his@@ hai , the son of Jah@@ do , the son of B@@ uz ;
the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of val@@ i@@ ant men , men able to bear bu@@ ck@@ ler and s@@ word , and to sho@@ ot with bo@@ w , and s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in war , were for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand seven hundred and six@@ ty , that were able to go forth to war .
these were the heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses : even Ep@@ her , and I@@ sh@@ i , and Eli@@ el , and Az@@ ri@@ el , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and Ho@@ da@@ vi@@ ah , and Jah@@ di@@ el , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , famous men , heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses .
now these are their d@@ wel@@ ling places according to their en@@ camp@@ ments in their borders : to the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites ( for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot ) ,
to the rest of the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h were given by lot , out of the family of the tri@@ be , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be , the half of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
to the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m , according to their families , out of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
to the sons of Mer@@ ari were given by lot , according to their families , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
they gave by lot out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin , these cities which are mentioned by name .
and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , An@@ er with its subur@@ bs , and Bil@@ e@@ am with its subur@@ bs , for the rest of the family of the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h .
to the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m were given , out of the family of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with its subur@@ bs , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th with its subur@@ bs ;
and beyond the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o , on the east side of the Jordan , were given them , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , B@@ ez@@ er in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with its subur@@ bs , and Jah@@ z@@ ah with its subur@@ bs ,
the sons of Tola : Uz@@ zi , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Jer@@ i@@ el , and Jah@@ ma@@ i , and I@@ b@@ sam , and Sh@@ em@@ uel , heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses , of Tola ; m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or in their generations : their number in the days of David was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand six hundred .
the sons of Bel@@ a : E@@ z@@ bon , and Uz@@ zi , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th , and I@@ RI , five ; heads of fa@@ thers ' houses , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or ; and they were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand thirty @@@ -@@ @ four .
all these were sons of J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , according to the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , se@@ ven@@ teen thousand and two hundred , who were able to go forth in the army for war .
Rep@@ ha@@ h was his son , and Res@@ hep@@ h , and Te@@ lah his son , and Tah@@ an his son ,
and by the borders of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns , D@@ or and its towns . in these lived the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of As@@ her , heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses , choice and m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , chief of the pr@@ inces . the number of them rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy for service in war was twenty @@@ -@@ @ six thousand men .
U@@ th@@ ai the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud , the son of Om@@ ri , the son of Im@@ ri , the son of Ban@@ i , of the children of Per@@ ez the son of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and I@@ b@@ ne@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and E@@ lah the son of Uz@@ zi , the son of Mic@@ hri , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Re@@ uel , the son of I@@ b@@ ni@@ j@@ ah ;
and their brothers , according to their generations , nine hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six . all these men were heads of fa@@ thers ' households by their fa@@ thers ' houses .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of God 's house ;
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of A@@ SA , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , who lived in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
so they and their children had the over@@ sight of the gates of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , even the house of the tent , by wards .
for the four chief por@@ ters , who were L@@ evi@@ tes , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treas@@ ur@@ ies in God 's house .
some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and over the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the office of trust over the things that were bak@@ ed in p@@ ans .
these are the singers , heads of fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the val@@ ley saw that they fled , and that Sa@@ ul and his sons were dead , they for@@ so@@ ok their cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and took away the body of Sa@@ ul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and buried their b@@ ones under the o@@ ak in J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and fas@@ ted seven days .
in times past , even when Sa@@ ul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h your God said to you , ' You shall be she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of my people Israel , and you shall be pr@@ ince over my people Israel . ' "
now these are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Israel .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
the three broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h ,
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
now these are those who came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish ; and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , his hel@@ pers in war .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flow@@ ed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
on the other side of the Jordan , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand .
so David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t move the Ar@@ k to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes . San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his brothers , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their brothers , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so David , and the el@@ ders of Israel , and the cap@@ tains over thousands , went to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom with joy .
David was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ro@@ be of fine lin@@ en , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k , and the singers , and Chen@@ an@@ i@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ep@@ ho@@ d of lin@@ en .
thus all Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with sound of the cor@@ net , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding al@@ oud with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and har@@ ps .
so he left there , before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , A@@ sap@@ h and his brothers , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required ;
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he comman@@ ded to Israel ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you have gone , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fa@@ thers , that I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yah@@ we@@ h God .
King David also dedicated these to Yah@@ we@@ h , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they had made themselves odi@@ ous to David , Han@@ un and the children of Am@@ mon sent one thousand tal@@ ents of silver to h@@ ire them char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men out of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , and out of Ar@@ am@@ ma@@ ac@@ ah , and out of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans who were beyond the River , with S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the army of Had@@ ade@@ zer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syri@@ ans , they fought with him .
David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew s@@ word : and in Ju@@ da@@ h were four hundred sev@@ enty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
but the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying , ' You have shed blood ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the ear@@ th in my sight .
now , be@@ hold , in my aff@@ li@@ ction I have prepared for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h one hundred thousand tal@@ ents of gold , one million tal@@ ents of silver , and br@@ ass and iron without weight ; for it is in ab@@ und@@ ance . I have also prepared tim@@ ber and stone ; and you may add to them .
the sons of Am@@ ram : Aaron and Mos@@ es ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanc@@ ti@@ fy the most hol@@ y things , he and his sons , fore@@ ver , to bur@@ n incen@@ se before Yah@@ we@@ h , to minister to him , and to b@@ less in his name , fore@@ ver .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after their fa@@ thers ' houses , even the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , from twenty years old and up@@ ward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen , heads of fa@@ thers ' houses ; and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , eight .
this was their or@@ dering in their service , to come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h according to the ordin@@ ance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had comman@@ ded him .
moreover , David and the cap@@ tains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and har@@ ps , for the service of God 's house ; A@@ sap@@ h , J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and H@@ eman being under the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instruc@@ ted in singing to Yah@@ we@@ h , even all who were s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful , was two hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons : Sh@@ im@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him chief ) ,
this S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the army , had dedicated .
all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated , who@@ ever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th , and of his brothers .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites , Has@@ habi@@ ah and his brothers , men of val@@ or , one thousand seven hundred , had the over@@ sight of Israel beyond the Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , for all the business of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the service of the king .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even of the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to their generations by fa@@ thers ' households . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the tow@@ ers , was Jon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over the ca@@ me@@ ls was O@@ bil the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elite : and over the don@@ ke@@ ys was J@@ eh@@ de@@ i@@ ah the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite : and over the f@@ loc@@ ks was Jaz@@ iz the Hag@@ r@@ ite .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le , and of its houses , and of its treas@@ ur@@ ies , and of the up@@ per rooms of it , and of the in@@ ner rooms of it , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ;
and the pat@@ tern of all that he had by the Spiri@@ t , for the courts of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all the surrounding rooms , for the treas@@ ur@@ ies of God 's house , and for the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the dedicated things ;
also for the divisions of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and for all the work of the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
by weight also for the lam@@ p@@ stands of gold , and for its lam@@ ps , of gold , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps ; and for the lam@@ p@@ stands of silver , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps , according to the use of every lam@@ p@@ stand ;
in addition , because I have set my aff@@ ection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of ar@@ tis@@ ans . who then offers will@@ ingly to consec@@ rate himself this day to Yah@@ we@@ h ? "
then the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households , and the pr@@ inces of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rul@@ ers over the king 's work , offered will@@ ingly ;
yo@@ urs , Yah@@ we@@ h , is the gre@@ at@@ ness , the power , the gl@@ ory , the victory , and the maj@@ es@@ ty ! for all that is in the heav@@ ens and in the ear@@ th is yo@@ urs . yo@@ urs is the k@@ ing@@ dom , Yah@@ we@@ h , and you are ex@@ al@@ ted as head above all .
both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your comman@@ d@@ ments , your testimon@@ ies , and your stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es to Yah@@ we@@ h , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bul@@ ls , one thousand r@@ ams , and one thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance for all Israel ,
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the history of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every pr@@ ince in all Israel , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tent of Meet@@ ing of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but David had brought the Ar@@ k of God up from Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the bronze alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , was there before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking coun@@ sel there .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem on Mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : the wing of the one was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
he set up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
also he made the m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass ; and its he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
the two pil@@ lars , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pil@@ lars , and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ,
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors of it for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the main hall of the temp@@ le were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; these the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led to him , were before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h to its place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
it happened , when the pri@@ ests had come out of the hol@@ y place , ( for all the pri@@ ests who were present had sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t keep their divisions ;
" Yah@@ we@@ h has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant shall pra@@ y toward this place .
listen to the peti@@ tions of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place : yes , hear from your d@@ wel@@ ling place , even from heav@@ en ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
then hear from heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , bringing re@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ lic@@ t them :
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own pla@@ gue and his own sor@@ row , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear from heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place and for@@ give , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; when they shall come and pra@@ y toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enem@@ ies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall rep@@ ent themselves in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , we have done per@@ ver@@ sely , and have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , where they have carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
thus Solomon finished the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in his own house .
if my people , who are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom , according as I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ru@@ ler in Israel . '
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and all that Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people who were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of Israel ;
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , three times in the year , in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of ten@@ ts .
Hur@@ am sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Op@@ hir , and f@@ et@@ ched from there four hundred fif@@ ty tal@@ ents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and be@@ hold , the half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of your wis@@ dom was not told me : you exceed the f@@ ame that I heard .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er concerning Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get himself up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jer@@ usalem , he assemb@@ led the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , one hundred eigh@@ ty thousand chosen men , who were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , to bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not exec@@ ute the pri@@ est 's office to Yah@@ we@@ h ;
so they strengthened the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon strong , three years ; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon .
he dealt wis@@ ely , and disper@@ sed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , to every for@@ ti@@ fied city : and he gave them food in ab@@ und@@ ance . he sought for them many wi@@ ves .
it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was established , and he was strong , that he for@@ so@@ ok the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all Israel with him .
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
now the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , first and last , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the histor@@ ies of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t and of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er , after the way of gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies ? there were wars between Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am continu@@ ally .
ought you not to know that Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David fore@@ ver , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
be@@ hold , God is with us at our head , and his pri@@ ests with the tr@@ ump@@ ets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don '@@ t fight against Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers ; for you shall not prosp@@ er . "
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it happened , that God struck Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ SA and the people who were with him pursu@@ ed them to Ger@@ ar : and there fell of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians so many that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yah@@ we@@ h , and before his army ; and they carried away very much bo@@ o@@ ty .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troub@@ les were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around .
also Ma@@ ac@@ ah , the mother of A@@ SA the king , he removed from being qu@@ een , because she had made an ab@@ omin@@ able image for an Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ SA cut down her image , and made d@@ ust of it , and bur@@ n@@ t it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of A@@ SA , Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel went up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said to him , " Bec@@ ause you have reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and have not reli@@ ed on Yah@@ we@@ h your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
for the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h run back and forth throughout the whole ear@@ th , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in you have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly ; for from hen@@ ce@@ forth you shall have wars . "
then A@@ SA was angry with the se@@ er , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people at the same time .
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ ninth year of his reign A@@ SA was dis@@ eased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h , but to the physi@@ cians .
they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , having the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught among the people .
this was the num@@ ber@@ ing of them according to their fa@@ thers ' houses : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
now the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , ar@@ ray@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets were pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying before them .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and Yah@@ we@@ h helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a certain man drew his bo@@ w at ran@@ dom , and struck the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the arm@@ or . therefore he said to the driver of the char@@ i@@ ot , " Tur@@ n your hand , and carry me out of the army ; for I am severely wounded . "
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel pro@@ pped himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the Lev@@ ite , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , in the mid@@ st of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . be@@ hold , they are coming up by the as@@ cent of Z@@ iz . you shall find them at the end of the val@@ ley , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites and of the children of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with an exceeding l@@ oud voice .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ a@@ b stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Se@@ ir , ut@@ ter@@ ly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , everyone helped to destroy another .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the history of J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani , which is in@@ ser@@ ted in the book of the kings of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up over the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the s@@ word , and various also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
a letter came to him from Eli@@ j@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , ' Bec@@ ause you have not walked in the ways of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at your father , nor in the ways of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h ,
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem to play the pro@@ stitute , like the house of A@@ ha@@ b did , and also have sla@@ in your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yo@@ ur@@ self :
and they came up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and broke into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , except Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment on the house of A@@ ha@@ b , that he found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the brothers of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , minist@@ ering to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , and killed them .
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
this is the thing that you shall do . a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the th@@ res@@ holds .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , except the pri@@ ests , and those who minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes . they shall come in , for they are hol@@ y , but all the people shall follow Yah@@ we@@ h 's instruc@@ tions .
the L@@ evi@@ tes shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . who@@ ever comes into the house , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dismiss the shift .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds the spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down , and broke his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came through the up@@ per gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to restore the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and also such as worked iron and br@@ ass to repair the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syri@@ ans came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all their sp@@ oil to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan , of Jer@@ usalem .
now it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , the army that had come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : therefore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in fierce an@@ ger .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se to them .
therefore the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , and he sent to him a pro@@ phe@@ t , who said to him , " Wh@@ y have you sought after the go@@ ds of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
you say to yo@@ ur@@ self that you have struck E@@ dom ; and your heart lif@@ ts you up to bo@@ ast . now stay at home . why should you med@@ dle with trouble , that you should fall , even you , and Ju@@ da@@ h with you ? ' "
Jo@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Jo@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
now from the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah turned away from following Yah@@ we@@ h , they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem . he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and killed him there .
he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and broke down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d ; and he built cities in the country of Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the chief pri@@ est , and all the pri@@ ests , looked on him , and be@@ hold , he was le@@ pro@@ us in his fore@@ head , and they th@@ rust him out quickly from there ; yes , himself hur@@ ried also to go out , because Yah@@ we@@ h had struck him .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the field of bur@@ ial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a le@@ per . " Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , like David his father ;
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
then some of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against those who came from the war ,
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines also had inv@@ aded the cities of the low@@ land , and of the South of Ju@@ da@@ h , and had taken Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and G@@ eder@@ o@@ th , and So@@ co with its towns , and Tim@@ n@@ ah with its towns , G@@ imz@@ o also and its towns : and they lived there .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and out of the house of the king and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t help him .
A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bring him into the tom@@ bs of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of Yah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
the pri@@ ests went in to the in@@ ner part of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le into the court of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in eight days : and on the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleans@@ ed all the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
so they killed the bul@@ ls , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : and they killed the r@@ ams , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing pra@@ ises to Yah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
D@@ on '@@ t be like your fa@@ thers , and like your brothers , who t@@ res@@ passed against Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , so that he gave them up to de@@ so@@ lation , as you see .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h gave to the assembly for offer@@ ings one thousand bul@@ ls and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the assembly a thousand bul@@ ls and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
all the assembly of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , who lived in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of c@@ attle and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of dedicated things which were consec@@ rated to Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
after this , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( now he was before L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him ) , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all Ju@@ da@@ h who were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
D@@ on '@@ t you know what I and my fa@@ thers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations which my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jer@@ usalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z , in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the as@@ cent of the tom@@ bs of the sons of David : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did him hon@@ or at his death . Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m ; and he prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
he took away the foreign go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers who spoke to him in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his pray@@ er also , and how God was ent@@ re@@ ated of him , and all his sin and his t@@ res@@ pass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Ash@@ er@@ im and the en@@ gra@@ ved images , before he hum@@ b@@ led himself : be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Ho@@ zai .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father ; and Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to all the en@@ gra@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the work@@ men who la@@ bo@@ red in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it to mend and repair the house ;
they have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and into the hand of the work@@ men . "
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they whom the king had comman@@ ded , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Tok@@ hat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wr@@ ath p@@ oured out on this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' " '
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : " as tou@@ ching the words which you have heard ,
stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fa@@ thers ' house of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and young go@@ ats , all of them for the P@@ ass@@ over offer@@ ings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ ls : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yah@@ we@@ h , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . so they did with the c@@ attle .
they ro@@ asted the P@@ ass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the hol@@ y offer@@ ings bo@@ iled they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so his servants took him out of the char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem ; and he died , and was buried in the tom@@ bs of his fa@@ thers . all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
moreover all the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , and the people , t@@ res@@ passed very greatly after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations ; and they pollu@@ ted the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which he had made hol@@ y in Jer@@ usalem .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up early and sending , because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces , all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who@@ ever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jer@@ usalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , besides all that was will@@ ingly offered .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ nine .
of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , when they came to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem , offered will@@ ingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the alt@@ ar on its base ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it to Yah@@ we@@ h , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
then J@@ es@@ hua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to have the over@@ sight of the work@@ men in God 's house : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and heads of fa@@ thers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice . many also sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy ,
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people ; for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard far away .
in the days of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es wrote B@@ ish@@ lam , Mi@@ th@@ red@@ ath , T@@ ab@@ e@@ el , and the rest of his compan@@ ions , to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Per@@ sia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian , and set forth in the Syrian language .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble Os@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the city of Samar@@ ia , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , and in the end it will be hur@@ t@@ ful to the kings .
then the king sent an answer to Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and to Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and to the rest of their compan@@ ions who d@@ well in Samar@@ ia , and in the rest of the country beyond the River : peace , and so forth .
I decre@@ ed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
then when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
now the pro@@ ph@@ ets , Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of I@@ d@@ do , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to the Jews who were in Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to them .
but the eye of their God was on the el@@ ders of the Jews , and they did not make them ce@@ ase , until the matter should come to Dar@@ i@@ us , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those Cy@@ ru@@ s the king took out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
then the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archi@@ ves , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
also I have made a decree , that who@@ ever shall al@@ ter this word , let a be@@ am be pulled out from his house , and let him be lifted up and fas@@ tened there@@ on ; and let his house be made a d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill for this :
the children of Israel , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedic@@ ation of this house of God with joy .
they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even the s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel :
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , who are min@@ ded of their own free will to go to Jer@@ usalem , go with you .
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
therefore you shall with all dil@@ ig@@ ence buy with this money bul@@ ls , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their me@@ al offer@@ ings and their drink offer@@ ings , and shall offer them on the alt@@ ar of the house of your God which is in Jer@@ usalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
whatever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heav@@ en ; for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that tou@@ ching any of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , the singers , por@@ ters , N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be law@@ ful to impose tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , on them .
who@@ ever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all dil@@ ig@@ ence , whether it be to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fa@@ thers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
now these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of those who went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king :
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , who were teachers .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors , and his pr@@ inces , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch , and keep them , until you we@@ igh them before the chiefs of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the rooms of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves and for their sons , so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers has been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass . "
when I heard this thing , I t@@ ore my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down con@@ founded .
and I said , " My God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ tin@@ ess has grown up to the heav@@ ens .
Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of E@@ lam , answ@@ ered E@@ z@@ ra , " We have t@@ res@@ passed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
then E@@ z@@ ra rose up from before God 's house , and went into the room of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b : and when he came there , he ate no bread , nor d@@ rank water ; for he mour@@ ned because of their t@@ res@@ pass of the cap@@ tivity .
the children of the cap@@ tivity did so . E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , with certain heads of fa@@ thers ' households , after their fa@@ thers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua , the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his brothers , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
that Han@@ ani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days ; and I fas@@ ted and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
but if you return to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and do them , though your out@@ casts were in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ ens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to d@@ well there . '
it happened in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I said to the king , " Let the king live fore@@ ver ! why sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fa@@ thers ' tom@@ bs , lies waste , and its gates have been consu@@ med with fire ? "
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jer@@ usalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I ro@@ de on .
I went out by night by the val@@ ley gate , even toward the Jack@@ al 's well , and to the D@@ ung gate , and viewed the walls of Jer@@ usalem , which were broken down , and its gates were consu@@ med with fire .
the rul@@ ers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest who did the work .
but when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , and G@@ es@@ hem the Ara@@ bi@@ an , heard it , they ri@@ dic@@ uled us , and desp@@ ised us , and said , " What is this thing that you are doing ? will you rebel against the king ? "
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est rose up with his brothers the pri@@ ests , and they built the she@@ ep gate ; they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and set up its doors ; even to the to@@ wer of Ham@@ me@@ ah they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , to the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ el .
next to them , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ ah , the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z made repairs . next to them , Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ el made repairs . next to them , Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana made repairs .
Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the district of Beth Hac@@ ch@@ er@@ em rep@@ aired the D@@ ung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
after him , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Beth Z@@ ur , made repairs to the place opposite the tom@@ bs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty men .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer that stands out from the up@@ per house of the king , which is by the court of the guard . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h made repairs .
but it happened that when San@@ bal@@ lat , To@@ bi@@ ah , the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ di@@ tes heard that the rep@@ air@@ ing of the walls of Jer@@ usalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
it happened , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the co@@ ats of mail ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they all built the wall and those who b@@ ore bur@@ den@@ s loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
moreover there were at my table , of the Jews and the rul@@ ers , one hundred fif@@ ty men , besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us .
you have also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of you at Jer@@ usalem , saying , ' There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together . "
it happened , when all our enem@@ ies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Ju@@ da@@ h sworn to him , because he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an had taken the daughter of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah as wife .
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
of the pri@@ ests : the children of H@@ ob@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
also J@@ es@@ hua , and Ban@@ i , and S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , J@@ amin , Ak@@ ku@@ b , Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai , Ho@@ di@@ ah , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , Kel@@ ita , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , Joz@@ ab@@ ad , H@@ anan , Pe@@ la@@ i@@ ah , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stayed in their place .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to give attention to the words of the law .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , everyone on the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and lived in the bo@@ o@@ ths ; for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
also day by day , from the first day to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , according to the ordin@@ ance .
and showed signs and won@@ ders against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them , and made a name for yo@@ ur@@ self , as it is this day .
moreover , in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud you led them by day ; and in a pil@@ lar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and comman@@ ded them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which you had sworn to give them .
moreover you gave them k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms and peoples , which you al@@ lot@@ ted according to their por@@ tions . so they poss@@ essed the land of S@@ ih@@ on , even the land of the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an .
you also multi@@ p@@ lied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spiri@@ t through your pro@@ ph@@ ets . yet would they not give e@@ ar . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept your law , nor list@@ ened to your comman@@ d@@ ments and your testimon@@ ies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in your great Go@@ od@@ ness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
" be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fa@@ thers to eat its fruit and its good , be@@ hold , we are servants in it .
it yi@@ elds much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have power over our bodies , and over our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
and to bring the first fru@@ its of our ground , and the first fru@@ its of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ born of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , to the pri@@ ests who minister in the house of our God ;
the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
in Jer@@ usalem lived certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Col@@ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite .
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fa@@ thers ' households , two hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and A@@ mas@@ h@@ sa@@ i the son of A@@ zar@@ el , the son of Ah@@ zai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
as for the L@@ evi@@ tes , in the days of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , Jo@@ i@@ ada , and Johan@@ an , and Jad@@ du@@ a , there were recorded the heads of fa@@ thers ' households ; also the pri@@ ests , in the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the Per@@ sian .
the sons of L@@ evi , heads of fa@@ thers ' households , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
the chiefs of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Has@@ habi@@ ah , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Kad@@ mi@@ el , with their brothers over against them , to praise and give thanks , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David the man of God , watch next to watch .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in proc@@ ession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the D@@ ung gate ;
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets : Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h ;
by the spring gate , and stra@@ ight before them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the as@@ cent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Ham@@ me@@ ah , even to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ abi@@ te should not enter into the assembly of God fore@@ ver ,
I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them ; so that the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
there lived men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , who brought in fish , and all kinds of war@@ es , and sold on the Sab@@ b@@ ath to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Wh@@ y do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on the Sab@@ b@@ ath .
I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and struck certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , " You shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
now it happened in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us who re@@ ig@@ ned from India even to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both great and small , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not comp@@ ul@@ sory ; for so the king had instruc@@ ted all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een will become known to all women , causing them to show con@@ temp@@ t for their hus@@ bands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . '
for he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to its writing , and to every people in their language , that every man should rule his own house , speaking in the language of his own people .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
the king lov@@ ed Es@@ ther more than all the women , and she obtained fav@@ or and kin@@ d@@ ness in his sight more than all the vir@@ g@@ ins ; so that he set the royal cro@@ wn on her head , and made her qu@@ een instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , who were do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
when this matter was investigated , and it was found to be so , they were both han@@ ged on a tree ; and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les in the king 's presence .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bo@@ wed down , and paid H@@ om@@ age to Ham@@ an ; for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bo@@ w down or pay him H@@ om@@ age .
but he scor@@ ned the thought of lay@@ ing hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone , for they had made known to him Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's people . therefore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's people .
if it ple@@ ases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand tal@@ ents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies . "
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and comman@@ ded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
now it happened on the third day that Es@@ ther put on her royal clo@@ thing , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , she obtained fav@@ or in his sight ; and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ ter that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther came near , and touched the top of the scep@@ ter .
then Ham@@ an went out that day jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart , but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wr@@ ath against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
Ham@@ an re@@ counted to them the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , the multi@@ tude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night , the king co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t sle@@ ep . he comman@@ ded the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les to be brought , and they were read to the king .
the king said again to Es@@ ther on the second day at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , " What is your petition , qu@@ een Es@@ ther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed . "
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered , " If I have found fav@@ or in your sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
Es@@ ther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and beg@@ ged him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
a cop@@ y of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
they killed Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , Dal@@ ph@@ on , A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
the Jews who were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and killed three hundred men in Sh@@ us@@ han ; but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t lay their hand on the sp@@ oil .
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the un@@ wal@@ led towns , make the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gla@@ d@@ ness and fe@@ asting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
because Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a , the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plot@@ ted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consum@@ e them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he had dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to which the king advanced him , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " then S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize him , they raised their voices , and we@@ pt ; and they each t@@ ore his ro@@ be , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust on their heads toward the sky .
as for that night , let th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize on it . let it not re@@ jo@@ ice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its tw@@ il@@ ight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the ey@@ eli@@ ds of the morning ,
" my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
if I am w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e to me . if I am righ@@ te@@ ous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with dis@@ grace , and con@@ sci@@ ous of my aff@@ li@@ ction .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is con@@ temp@@ t for mis@@ fortun@@ e . it is ready for them whose fo@@ ot sli@@ ps .
you also put my feet in the sto@@ cks , and mark all my p@@ aths . you set a bound to the so@@ les of my feet ,
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the nec@@ k , and d@@ ashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the wor@@ m , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a st@@ ran@@ ger . " my heart is consu@@ med within me .
that for which he la@@ bo@@ red he shall restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down . according to the sub@@ stance that he has gotten , he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice .
in the ful@@ l@@ ness of his suffici@@ ency , dist@@ ress shall over@@ take him . the hand of everyone who is in mis@@ ery shall come on him .
they are ex@@ al@@ ted ; yet a little while , and they are gone . yes , they are brought low , they are taken out of the way as all others , and are cut off as the tops of the e@@ ars of gra@@ in .
then the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el , the Buz@@ ite , of the family of R@@ am , was kin@@ d@@ led against Jo@@ b . his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led because he justified himself rather than God .
it was so , that after Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken these words to Jo@@ b , Yah@@ we@@ h said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , " My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b has .

cause me to hear your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my sou@@ l to you .
< < By David . > > b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , my rock , who teach@@ es my hands to war , and my fin@@ gers to battle :
< < A praise p@@ sal@@ m by David@@ .@@ This is an ac@@ ro@@ stic p@@ sal@@ m , with every verse ( including the second half of verse 13 ) starting with a consecutive letter of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w alp@@ ha@@ bet . > > I will ex@@ alt you , my God , the King . I will praise your name fore@@ ver and ever .
I also will la@@ ug@@ h at your disaster . I will mo@@ ck when cal@@ am@@ ity over@@ takes you ;
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sle@@ ep will be swe@@ et .
D@@ on '@@ t with@@ hold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
even a fo@@ ol , when he keeps silent , is counted wise . when he sh@@ u@@ ts his li@@ ps , he is thought to be dis@@ cer@@ ning .
if you say , " be@@ hold , we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know this " ; do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he who weigh@@ s the hear@@ ts consider it ? he who keeps your sou@@ l , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he know it ? shall he not ren@@ der to every man according to his work ?
for it is better that it be said to you , " C@@ ome up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince , whom your eyes have seen .
D@@ on '@@ t for@@ sake your friend and your father 's friend . D@@ on '@@ t go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neigh@@ bor who is near than a distant brother .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ iden .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continu@@ ally as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wis@@ dom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
I also gathered silver and gold for myself , and the treasure of kings and of the provinces . I got myself male and female singers , and the deli@@ ghts of the sons of men@@ -@@ -@@ musical instruments , and that of all sor@@ ts .
then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked , and at the la@@ bor that I had la@@ bo@@ red to do ; and be@@ hold , all was van@@ ity and a ch@@ asing after wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
for of the wise man , even as of the fo@@ ol , there is no memory for ever , since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten . indeed , the wise man must die just like the fo@@ ol !
who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet he will have rule over all of my la@@ bor in which I have la@@ bo@@ red , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is van@@ ity .
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his sou@@ l enjoy good in his la@@ bor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set et@@ ern@@ ity in their hear@@ ts , yet so that man can '@@ t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
then I returned and saw all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold , the te@@ ars of those who were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but wo@@ e to him who is alone when he falls , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have another to lift him up .
D@@ on '@@ t be ras@@ h with your m@@ outh , and don '@@ t let your heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter anything before God ; for God is in heav@@ en , and you on ear@@ th . therefore let your words be few .
as he came forth from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he go again as he came , and shall take nothing for his la@@ bor , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , and in the day of ad@@ versity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don '@@ t withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wis@@ dom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is st@@ up@@ idity , and that fo@@ ol@@ ishness is mad@@ ness .
which my sou@@ l still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
there is a van@@ ity which is done on the ear@@ th , that there are righ@@ te@@ ous men to whom it happens according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked . again , there are w@@ ic@@ ked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous . I said that this also is van@@ ity .
when I applied my heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done on the ear@@ th ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sle@@ ep with his eyes ) ,
also their love , their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y has per@@ ished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion fore@@ ver in anything that is done under the sun .
for man also do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know his time . as the fish that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are , even so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it falls su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them .
D@@ on '@@ t cur@@ se the king , no , not in your th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and don '@@ t cur@@ se the rich in your bed@@ room : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has w@@ ings may tell the matter .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the ear@@ th ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
as you don '@@ t know what is the way of the wind , nor how the b@@ ones grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her who is with child ; even so you don '@@ t know the work of God who does all .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of music shall be brought low ;
D@@ on '@@ t st@@ are at me because I am dark , because the sun has scor@@ ched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards . I ha@@ ven '@@ t kept my own v@@ ine@@ yard .
my do@@ ve in the cle@@ fts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountain@@ side , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is swe@@ et , and your face is lov@@ ely .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the s@@ quar@@ es I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
I had scar@@ c@@ ely passed from them , when I found him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , into the room of her who conce@@ ived me .
go forth , you da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and see king Solomon , with the cro@@ wn with which his mother has crow@@ ned him , in the day of his w@@ ed@@ dings , in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart . L@@ over
come with me from Lebanon , my bri@@ de , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Sen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the li@@ ons ' den@@ s , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
I opened to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; but my bel@@ ov@@ ed left ; and had gone away . my heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him . I called him , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer .
O@@ h that you were like my brother , who nur@@ sed from the bre@@ asts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would k@@ is@@ s you ; yes , and no one would desp@@ ise me .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it : wounds , wel@@ ts , and open so@@ res . they ha@@ ven '@@ t been closed , neither ban@@ da@@ ged , neither so@@ o@@ th@@ ed with oil .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow to it .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots .
for there will be a day of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be brought low ; and Yah@@ we@@ h alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
the people will be op@@ pressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neigh@@ bor . the child will be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the old man , and the base against the hon@@ or@@ able .
it shall happen that instead of swe@@ et sp@@ ices , there shall be rot@@ ten@@ ness ; instead of a bel@@ t , a ro@@ pe ; instead of well set ha@@ ir , bal@@ d@@ ness ; instead of a ro@@ be , a wearing of s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; and br@@ anding instead of beauty .
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from its mid@@ st , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grap@@ es , did it yield wild grap@@ es ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard . I will take away its h@@ edge , and it will be e@@ aten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tr@@ amp@@ led down .
for the v@@ ine@@ yard of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is the house of Israel , and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h his pleas@@ ant plant : and he looked for justice , but , be@@ hold , op@@ pression ; for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but , be@@ hold , a cry of dist@@ ress .
Wo@@ e to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to d@@ well alone in the mid@@ st of the land !
who say , " Let him make speed , let him has@@ ten his work , that we may see it ; and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the bel@@ t of their wa@@ ist be un@@ tied , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
their ro@@ aring will be like a li@@ on@@ ess . they will ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons . yes , they shall ro@@ ar , and se@@ ize their pre@@ y and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
if there is a tenth left in it , that also will in turn be consu@@ med : as a ter@@ eb@@ inth , and as an o@@ ak , whose stock remains when they are fel@@ led ; so the hol@@ y se@@ ed is its stock . "
it happened in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up to Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is al@@ lied with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . " his heart tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tre@@ m@@ ble with the wind .
" let 's go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its mid@@ st , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ el . "
it will happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will wh@@ ist@@ le for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
in that day the Lord will s@@ have with a ra@@ zor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head and the ha@@ ir of the feet ; and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
and it shall happen , that because of the ab@@ und@@ ance of milk which they shall give he shall eat but@@ ter : for everyone will eat but@@ ter and hon@@ ey that is left in the mid@@ st of the land .
all the hil@@ ls that were cultiv@@ ated with the ho@@ e , you shall not come there for fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of she@@ ep . "
for before the child knows how to say , ' My father , ' and , ' My mother , ' the ri@@ ches of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the sp@@ oil of Samar@@ ia will be carried away by the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord brings upon them the m@@ igh@@ ty flood waters of the River : the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and all his gl@@ ory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
they will pass through it , very dist@@ ressed and hun@@ gry ; and it will happen that when they are hun@@ gry , they will worry , and cur@@ se by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces up@@ ward ,
for all the arm@@ or of the armed man in the no@@ is@@ y battle , and the gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess bur@@ ns like a fire . it dev@@ ours the bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; yes , it kin@@ d@@ les in the th@@ ic@@ kets of the forest , and they rol@@ l up@@ ward in a col@@ umn of smoke .
one will dev@@ our on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
what will you do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which will come from af@@ ar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
however he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Z@@ ion and on Jer@@ usalem , I will punish the fruit of the will@@ ful proud heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the in@@ sol@@ ence of his ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty looks .
should an ax@@ e bra@@ g against him who ch@@ ops with it ? should a saw ex@@ alt itself above him who sa@@ ws with it ? as if a ro@@ d should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
it will come to pass in that day that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will no more again le@@ an on him who struck them , but shall le@@ an on Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will de@@ part from off your sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness he will judge the poor , and decide with equ@@ ity for the hum@@ ble of the ear@@ th . he will strike the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh ; and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps he will kill the w@@ ic@@ ked .
they will fly down on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines on the west . together they will pl@@ under the children of the east . they will extend their power over E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon will obe@@ y them .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Y@@ ah , Yah@@ we@@ h , is my strength and song ; and he has become my sal@@ vation . "
for the stars of the sky and its con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations will not give their light . the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to sh@@ ine .
it will happen that like a hun@@ ted gaz@@ elle , and like she@@ ep that no one ga@@ thers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their bo@@ ws will d@@ ash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b . their eyes will not spar@@ e children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Ara@@ bi@@ an will not pit@@ ch a tent there , neither will she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their f@@ loc@@ ks lie down there .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will have comp@@ as@@ sion on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreig@@ ner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will poss@@ ess them in Yah@@ we@@ h 's land for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids . they will take as cap@@ tives those whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
it will happen in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sor@@ row , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot on my mountains . then his yok@@ e will leave them , and his burden leave their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
D@@ on '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice , O Phil@@ isti@@ a , all of you , because the ro@@ d that struck you is broken ; for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root an ad@@ der will emerge , and his fruit will be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
my heart cri@@ es out for Mo@@ a@@ b ! her no@@ bles flee to Zo@@ ar , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah ; for they go up by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
a th@@ r@@ one will be established in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , jud@@ ging , seeking justice , and swift to do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
for the fields of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon langu@@ ish with the v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h . the lor@@ ds of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to Jaz@@ er , which w@@ and@@ ered into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . its sho@@ ots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
they will not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fin@@ gers have made , either the Ash@@ er@@ im , or the incen@@ se al@@ tar@@ s .
in the day of your plan@@ ting , you h@@ edge it in . in the morning , you make your se@@ ed b@@ los@@ so@@ m , but the har@@ v@@ est fle@@ es away in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
the nations will rush like the rus@@ hing of many waters : but he will re@@ bu@@ ke them , and they will flee far off , and will be ch@@ ased like the c@@ haf@@ f of the mountains before the wind , and like the wh@@ ir@@ ling d@@ ust before the storm .
at evening , be@@ hold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who pl@@ under us , and the lot of those who ro@@ b us .
for before the har@@ v@@ est , when the b@@ los@@ so@@ m is over , and the f@@ lower becomes a ri@@ pen@@ ing gra@@ pe , he will cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
they will be left together for the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of the mountains , and for the animals of the ear@@ th . the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds will summer on them , and all the animals of the ear@@ th will winter on them .
the burden of Egypt : " be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h ri@@ des on a swift cl@@ oud , and comes to Egypt . the id@@ ols of Egypt will tre@@ m@@ ble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will mel@@ t in its mid@@ st .
the me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws by the N@@ ile , by the br@@ ink of the N@@ ile , and all the so@@ wn fields of the N@@ ile , will become d@@ ry , be driven away , and be no more .
Yah@@ we@@ h has mixed a spirit of per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in the mid@@ st of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y in all of its works , like a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ gers in his v@@ om@@ it .
the land of Ju@@ da@@ h will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he determin@@ es against it .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h because of op@@ pres@@ sors , and he will send them a Sav@@ ior and a def@@ ender , and he will deliver them .
therefore my th@@ igh@@ s are filled with an@@ gu@@ ish . pain@@ s have taken hold on me , like the pain@@ s of a woman in la@@ bor . I am in so much p@@ ain that I can '@@ t hear . I so am dis@@ may@@ ed that I can '@@ t see .
you also made a reser@@ vo@@ ir between the two walls for the water of the old pool . but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t look to him who had done this , neither did you have respect for him who pur@@ posed it long ago .
he will su@@ rely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the char@@ i@@ ots of your gl@@ ory will be , you sh@@ ame of your lor@@ d 's house .
and I will clo@@ the him with your ro@@ be , and strengthen him with your bel@@ t . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his sho@@ ul@@ der . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
they will han@@ g on him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , every small ves@@ sel , from the c@@ ups even to all the pit@@ chers .
it will come to pass in that day that T@@ y@@ re will be forgotten sev@@ enty years , according to the days of one king . after the end of sev@@ enty years it will be to T@@ y@@ re like in the song of the pro@@ stitute .
it will happen after the end of sev@@ enty years that Yah@@ we@@ h will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
it will happen that he who fle@@ es from the no@@ ise of the fear will fall into the p@@ it ; and he who comes up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it will be taken in the sn@@ are ; for the windows on high are opened , and the foundations of the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ ble .
the ear@@ th will stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and will s@@ way back and forth like a ham@@ mo@@ ck . its dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
as the heat in a d@@ ry place will you bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers ; as the heat by the sha@@ de of a cl@@ oud , the song of the dre@@ aded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies will make all peoples a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of choice win@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of well refin@@ ed choice win@@ es .
he has sw@@ allowed up death fore@@ ver ! the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces . he will take the re@@ pro@@ ach of his people away from off all the ear@@ th , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " be@@ hold , this is our God ! we have w@@ aited for him , and he will save us ! this is Yah@@ we@@ h ! we have w@@ aited for him . we will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in his sal@@ vation ! "
for in this mountain the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h will rest . Mo@@ a@@ b will be tro@@ dden down in his place , even like stra@@ w is tro@@ dden down in the water of the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
he will spread out his hands in its mid@@ st , like one who sw@@ ims sp@@ reads out hands to sw@@ im , but his pride will be hum@@ b@@ led together with the craft of his hands .
for he has brought down those who d@@ well on high , the lo@@ f@@ ty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the d@@ ust .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly ; for when your judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let fav@@ or be shown to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet he will not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness he will deal wrong@@ fully , and will not see Yah@@ we@@ h 's maj@@ es@@ ty .
we have been with child . we have been in p@@ ain . we gave birth , it seems , only to wind . we have not worked any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
when its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are with@@ ered , they will be broken off . the women will come and set them on fire , for they are a people of no understanding . therefore he who made them will not have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and he who formed them will show them no fav@@ or .
they also reel with wine , and stag@@ ger with strong drink . the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t reel with strong drink . they are sw@@ allowed up by wine . they stag@@ ger with strong drink . they er@@ r in vision . they st@@ um@@ ble in judgment .
as often as it passes through , it will se@@ ize you ; for morning by morning it will pass through , by day and by night ; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message . "
when he has lev@@ eled its sur@@ face , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he plant the d@@ ill , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ in se@@ ed , and put in the wheat in ro@@ ws , the bar@@ ley in the appointed place , and the sp@@ el@@ t in its place ?
for the d@@ ill are not th@@ res@@ hed with a sharp instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned over the cum@@ in ; but the d@@ ill is beaten out with a stick , and the cum@@ in with a ro@@ d .
you will be brought down , and will speak out of the ground . your speech will m@@ um@@ ble out of the d@@ ust . your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and your speech will wh@@ is@@ per out of the d@@ ust .
but the multi@@ tude of your fo@@ es will be like fine d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ru@@ th@@ less ones like c@@ haf@@ f that blo@@ ws away . yes , it will be in an in@@ stan@@ t , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
the Lord said , " Bec@@ ause this people draws near with their m@@ outh and with their li@@ ps to hon@@ or me , but they have removed their heart far from me , and their fear of me is a comman@@ d@@ ment of men which has been ta@@ ught ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will proceed to do a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous work among this people , even a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous work and a wonder ; and the wis@@ dom of their wise men will per@@ ish , and the understanding of their pru@@ dent men will be hidden . "
Is@@ n '@@ t it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the de@@ af will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d will see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
but when he sees his children , the work of my hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name . yes , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and will stand in a@@ we of the God of Israel .
who set out to go down into Egypt , and have not asked my advice ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to take ref@@ uge in the shadow of Egypt !
he will break it as a P@@ ot@@ ter 's ves@@ sel is broken , breaking it in pieces without spar@@ ing , so that there won '@@ t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the Hear@@ th , or to dip up water out of the c@@ ister@@ n . "
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your e@@ ars will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ lay@@ ing of your en@@ gra@@ ved images of silver , and the pla@@ ting of your m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " G@@ o away ! "
he will give the rain for your se@@ ed , with which you will so@@ w the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plen@@ ti@@ ful . in that day , your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck will fe@@ ed in large pas@@ tures .
his bre@@ ath is as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream that reaches even to the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of destruction ; and a bri@@ dle that leads to ru@@ in will be in the j@@ a@@ ws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y feast is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Yah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cause his g@@ lor@@ ious voice to be heard , and will show the des@@ cent of his arm , with the in@@ dign@@ ation of his an@@ ger , and the fla@@ me of a dev@@ our@@ ing fire , with a blast , storm , and ha@@ il@@ stones .
every stro@@ ke of the ro@@ d of punishment , which Yah@@ we@@ h will lay on him , will be with the sound of tam@@ bour@@ ines and har@@ ps . he will fight with them in batt@@ les , br@@ and@@ ishing weapons .
Wo@@ e to those who go down to Egypt for help , and rely on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots because they are many , and in hor@@ se@@ men because they are very strong , but they don '@@ t look to the Holy One of Israel , and they don '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h !
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of those who work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
now the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are men , and not God ; and their hor@@ ses f@@ les@@ h , and not spirit . when Yah@@ we@@ h stret@@ ches out his hand , both he who helps shall st@@ um@@ ble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consu@@ med together .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can '@@ t compre@@ hend , with a st@@ range language that you can '@@ t understand .
their sla@@ in will also be cast out , and the st@@ en@@ ch of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will mel@@ t in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dis@@ solved . the sky will be rol@@ led up like a s@@ cr@@ oll , and all its armies will fade away , as a le@@ af f@@ ades from off a v@@ ine or a fi@@ g tree .
the wild animals of the de@@ sert will meet with the w@@ ol@@ ves , and the wild go@@ at will cry to his fellow . yes , the night cre@@ ature shall settle there , and shall find her@@ self a place of rest .
he has cast the lot for them , and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line . they shall poss@@ ess it fore@@ ver . from generation to generation they will d@@ well in it .
it will b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's gl@@ ory Lebanon will be given to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on . they will see Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of our God .
be@@ hold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even in Egypt , which if a man le@@ ans on it , it will go into his hand and Pi@@ erce it . so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
now therefore , ple@@ ase make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and called out with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a !
D@@ on '@@ t let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us . this city won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . " '
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of A@@ sap@@ h , the rec@@ order , came to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
" thus you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , " Jer@@ usalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to destroy for@@ ti@@ fied cities , turning them into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded . they were like the gr@@ ass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like a field before its cro@@ p has grown .
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons struck him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Ar@@ ar@@ at . E@@ sar H@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
and said , " Re@@ member now , Yah@@ we@@ h , I be@@ g you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
be@@ hold , I will cause the shadow on the sun@@ di@@ al , which has gone down on the sun@@ di@@ al of A@@ haz with the sun , to return back@@ ward ten steps . so the sun returned ten steps on the sun@@ di@@ al on which it had gone down . " ' "
my d@@ wel@@ ling is removed , and is carried away from me like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent . I have rol@@ led up , like a we@@ av@@ er , my life . he will cut me off from the lo@@ om . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great an@@ gu@@ ish , but you have in love for my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption ; for you have cast all my sin@@ s behind your back .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing will be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will come as a m@@ igh@@ ty one , and his arm will rule for him . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him .

who has meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and marked off the sky with his sp@@ an , and calculated the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
be@@ hold , the nations are like a drop in a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are regarded as a spec@@ k of d@@ ust on a balance . be@@ hold , he lif@@ ts up the islands like a very little thing .
it is he who s@@ its above the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and its inhabitants are like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens like a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ reads them out like a tent to d@@ well in ;

you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called from its cor@@ ners , and said to you , ' You are my ser@@ vant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
D@@ on '@@ t you be afraid , for I am with you . D@@ on '@@ t be dis@@ may@@ ed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you . yes , I will help you . yes , I will up@@ hold you with the right hand of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
you will seek them , and won '@@ t find them , even those who conten@@ d with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @@@ -@@ @ ex@@ istent thing .
you will win@@ now them , and the wind will carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind will sc@@ at@@ ter them . you will re@@ jo@@ ice in Yah@@ we@@ h . you will gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers on the b@@ are he@@ ights , and spr@@ ings in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s . I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
" let them announce , and declare to us what shall happen . declare the former things , what they are , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or show us things to come .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rul@@ ers as on mort@@ ar , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter t@@ reads cla@@ y .
who has declared it from the beginning , that we may know ? and before , that we may say , ' He is right ? ' su@@ rely , there is no one who declar@@ es . su@@ rely , there is no one who shows . su@@ rely , there is no one who he@@ ars your words .
thus says God Yah@@ we@@ h , he who created the heav@@ ens and stret@@ ched them out , he who spread out the ear@@ th and that which comes out of it , he who gives bre@@ ath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will go out like a m@@ igh@@ ty man . he will stir up z@@ e@@ al like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will sh@@ out al@@ oud . he will triumph over his enem@@ ies .
therefore he p@@ oured the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger on him , and the strength of battle ; and it set him on fire all around , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; and it burned him , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take it to heart . "
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and fla@@ me will not scor@@ ch you .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel : " for your sake , I have sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring all of them down as fugitives , even the Chal@@ de@@ ans , in the ships of their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .

the car@@ pen@@ ter stret@@ ches out a line . he marks it out with a pen@@ cil . he shap@@ es it with planes . he marks it out with comp@@ ass@@ es , and shap@@ es it like the figure of a man , with the beauty of a man , to resi@@ de in a house .
" I will go before you , and make the roug@@ h places smooth . I will break the doors of br@@ ass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .

calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man of my coun@@ sel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed , I will also do it .
you said , ' I shall be a mist@@ ress fore@@ ver ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
for you have tr@@ usted in your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; you have said , No one sees me ; your wis@@ dom and your knowledge , it has per@@ ver@@ ted you , and you have said in your heart , I am , and there is none else besides me .

I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I showed them : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I did them , and they happened .
therefore I have declared it to you from of old ; before it came to pass I showed it to you ; lest you should say , ' My i@@ dol has done them , and my en@@ gra@@ ved image , and my m@@ ol@@ ten image , has comman@@ ded them . '
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
yes , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; yes , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; yes , from of old your e@@ ar was not opened : for I knew that you dealt very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and was called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the w@@ om@@ b .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the ear@@ th , and my right hand has spread out the heav@@ ens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t thir@@ st when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
and he has made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand , he has hidden me : and he has made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver has he kept me close :
saying to those who are bound , ' C@@ ome out ! ' ; to those who are in d@@ ark@@ ness , ' Show yo@@ ur@@ selves ! ' " they shall fe@@ ed in the ways , and on all b@@ are he@@ ights shall be their pas@@ ture .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " be@@ hold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , and set up my ban@@ ner to the peoples ; and they shall bring your sons in their bos@@ om , and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be carried on their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " W@@ here is the bill of your mother 's div@@ or@@ ce , with which I have put her away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? be@@ hold , for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities were you sold , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions was your mother put away .
the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h has given me the ton@@ gue of those who are ta@@ ught , that I may know how to sustain with words him who is we@@ ary : he w@@ ak@@ ens morning by morning , he w@@ ak@@ ens my e@@ ar to hear as those who are ta@@ ught .
who is among you who fears Yah@@ we@@ h , who obe@@ ys the voice of his ser@@ vant ? he who walk@@ s in d@@ ark@@ ness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , you who seek Yah@@ we@@ h : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the p@@ it you were du@@ g from .
for Yah@@ we@@ h has comfor@@ ted Z@@ ion ; he has comfor@@ ted all her waste places , and has made her w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like E@@ den , and her de@@ sert like the gar@@ den of Yah@@ we@@ h ; joy and gla@@ d@@ ness shall be found there@@ in , Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of me@@ lo@@ dy .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
your sons have fa@@ in@@ ted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as an an@@ tel@@ ope in a net ; they are full of the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h , the re@@ bu@@ ke of your God .
thus says your Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , and your God who p@@ leads the cause of his people , " be@@ hold , I have taken out of your hand the c@@ up of stag@@ gering , even the bo@@ w@@ l of the c@@ up of my wr@@ ath ; you shall no more drink it again :

for you shall not go out in has@@ te , neither shall you go by flight : for Yah@@ we@@ h will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your re@@ ar guard .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of d@@ ry ground . he has no good looks or maj@@ es@@ ty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was op@@ pressed , yet when he was aff@@ lic@@ ted he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh . as a lam@@ b that is led to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep that before its s@@ hear@@ ers is m@@ ute , so he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh .

" D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you shall not be as@@ ha@@ med : neither be con@@ founded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the sh@@ ame of your youth ; and the re@@ pro@@ ach of your wi@@ do@@ who@@ od you shall remember no more .
" for this is like the waters of No@@ ah to me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of No@@ ah shall no more go over the ear@@ th , so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you , nor re@@ bu@@ ke you .

even them will I bring to my hol@@ y mountain , and make them jo@@ y@@ ful in my house of pray@@ er : their bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be accepted on my alt@@ ar ; for my house shall be called a house of pray@@ er for all peoples . "
yes , the do@@ gs are gre@@ edy , they can never have enough ; and these are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
for thus says the high and lo@@ f@@ ty One who inhabi@@ ts et@@ ern@@ ity , whose name is Holy : " I d@@ well in the high and hol@@ y place , with him also who is of a contr@@ ite and hum@@ ble spirit , to revive the spirit of the hum@@ ble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite .
'@@ Wh@@ y have we fas@@ ted , ' say they , ' and you don '@@ t see ? why have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and you take no knowledge ? ' " be@@ hold , in the day of your fast you find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ b@@ ors .
be@@ hold , you fast for stri@@ fe and contention , and to strike with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : you don '@@ t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
Is@@ n '@@ t it to distri@@ bute your bread to the hun@@ gry , and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house ? when you see the nak@@ ed , that you cover him ; and that you not hide yo@@ ur@@ self from your own f@@ les@@ h ?
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your he@@ aling shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y ; and your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before you ; the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be your re@@ ar guard .
then you shall call , and Yah@@ we@@ h will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' H@@ ere I am . ' " if you take away from the mid@@ st of you the yok@@ e , the putting forth of the fin@@ ger , and speaking w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ;
and Yah@@ we@@ h will guide you continu@@ ally , and satisfy your sou@@ l in d@@ ry places , and make strong your b@@ ones ; and you shall be like a wat@@ ered gar@@ den , and like a spring of water , whose waters don '@@ t fail .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the b@@ lin@@ d ; yes , we gro@@ pe as those who have no eyes : we st@@ um@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the tw@@ il@@ ight ; among those who are lu@@ st@@ y we are as dead men .
he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and a hel@@ met of sal@@ vation on his head ; and he put on gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a man@@ tle .
" as for me , this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , " says Yah@@ we@@ h . " my Spiri@@ t who is on you , and my words which I have put in your m@@ outh , shall not de@@ part out of your m@@ outh , nor out of the m@@ outh of your se@@ ed , nor out of the m@@ outh of your se@@ ed 's se@@ ed , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " from hen@@ ce@@ forth and fore@@ ver . "
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radi@@ ant , and your heart shall th@@ r@@ ill and be en@@ lar@@ ged ; because the ab@@ und@@ ance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
" the gl@@ ory of Lebanon shall come to you , the f@@ ir tree , the p@@ ine , and the box tree together , to be@@ auti@@ fy the place of my sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; and I will make the place of my feet g@@ lor@@ ious .
the sons of those who aff@@ lic@@ ted you shall come ben@@ ding to you ; and all those who desp@@ ised you shall bo@@ w themselves down at the so@@ les of your feet ; and they shall call you The city of Yah@@ we@@ h , The Z@@ ion of the Holy One of Israel .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light to you : but Yah@@ we@@ h will be to you an ever@@ lasting light , and your God your gl@@ ory .
but you shall be named the pri@@ ests of Yah@@ we@@ h ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will bo@@ ast in their gl@@ ory .
for as the ear@@ th brings forth its bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den causes the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and her sal@@ vation as a lam@@ p that bur@@ ns .
Yah@@ we@@ h has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " su@@ rely I will no more give your gra@@ in to be food for your enem@@ ies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have la@@ bo@@ red :
" I have tro@@ dden the win@@ e@@ press alone ; and of the peoples there was no man with me : yes , I tro@@ d them in my an@@ ger , and tr@@ amp@@ led them in my wr@@ ath ; and their li@@ fe@@ blood is sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on my gar@@ ments , and I have st@@ ained all my clo@@ thing .
I will make mention of the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses of Yah@@ we@@ h and the pra@@ ises of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h has bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he has bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses .
in all their aff@@ li@@ ction he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , and the an@@ gel of his presence sav@@ ed them : in his love and in his p@@ ity he re@@ deemed them ; and he b@@ ore them , and carried them all the days of old .
you meet him who re@@ jo@@ ices and works righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those who remember you in your ways . be@@ hold , you were angry , and we sin@@ ned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be sav@@ ed ?
for we have all become as one who is un@@ clean , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is as a pollu@@ ted gar@@ ment : and we all fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , take us away .
there is none who calls on your name , who s@@ tir@@ s up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consu@@ med us by means of our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
" I am inqu@@ ired of by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , Se@@ e me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
Shar@@ on shall be a fold of f@@ loc@@ ks , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or a place for her@@ ds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
they shall not build , and another in@@ ha@@ bit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Yah@@ we@@ h : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contr@@ ite spirit , and who tre@@ m@@ bles at my word .
I also will choose their de@@ lu@@ sions , and will bring their fears on them ; because when I called , no one answ@@ ered ; when I spoke , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ; but they did that which was ev@@ il in my eyes , and chose that in which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ light . "
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the gl@@ ory of the nations like an over@@ flow@@ ing stream : and you will nur@@ se . you will be carried on her side , and will be d@@ and@@ led on her k@@ ne@@ es .

now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shi@@ h@@ or ? or what have you to do in the way to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , to drink the waters of the River ?
" but where are your go@@ ds that you have made for yo@@ ur@@ selves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h .
also the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the innocent poor is found in your sk@@ ir@@ ts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . su@@ rely his an@@ ger has turned away from me . ' " be@@ hold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sin@@ ned . '
I saw , when , for this very cause that back@@ sli@@ ding Israel had committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , I had put her away and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , yet t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous Ju@@ da@@ h , her sister , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear ; but she also went and played the pro@@ stitute .
at that time they shall call Jer@@ usalem ' The th@@ r@@ one of Yah@@ we@@ h ; ' and all the nations shall be gathered to it , to the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , to Jer@@ usalem . neither shall they walk any more after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of their ev@@ il heart .
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inher@@ it@@ ance to your fa@@ thers .
a lion is gone up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land de@@ so@@ late , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabi@@ tant .
my an@@ gu@@ ish , my an@@ gu@@ ish ! I am pain@@ ed at my very heart ; my heart is dis@@ qu@@ i@@ eted in me ; I can '@@ t hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my sou@@ l , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , the alarm of war .
I will go to the great men , and will speak to them ; for they know the way of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the law of their God . " but these with one accord have broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
" how can I par@@ don you ? your children have for@@ sak@@ en me , and sworn by what are no go@@ ds . when I had f@@ ed them to the full , they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and assemb@@ led themselves in troops at the pro@@ stitu@@ tes ' houses .
be@@ hold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Yah@@ we@@ h . " it is a m@@ igh@@ ty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don '@@ t know , neither understand what they say .
they shall eat up your har@@ v@@ est , and your bread , which your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat . they shall eat up your f@@ loc@@ ks and your her@@ ds . they shall eat up your v@@ ines and your fi@@ g trees . they shall beat down your for@@ ti@@ fied cities , in which you trust , with the s@@ word .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Yah@@ we@@ h our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preser@@ ves to us the appointed weeks of the har@@ v@@ est . '
they have grown f@@ at . they sh@@ ine ; yes , they exc@@ ell in de@@ eds of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . they don '@@ t p@@ lead the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , that they may prosp@@ er ; and they don '@@ t judge the right of the ne@@ edy .
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can '@@ t listen . be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has become a re@@ pro@@ ach to them . they have no de@@ light in it .
they take hold of bo@@ w and spe@@ ar . they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy . their voice ro@@ ars like the sea , and they ride on hor@@ ses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Z@@ ion . "
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , from of old even fore@@ ver@@ more .
but go now to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I caused my name to d@@ well at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer :
the children gather wood , and the fa@@ thers kin@@ dle the fire , and the women k@@ ne@@ ad the d@@ ough , to make cak@@ es to the qu@@ een of the sky , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds , that they may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
for I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak to your fa@@ thers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
but this thing I comman@@ ded them , saying , listen to my voice , and I will be your God , and you shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
they have built the high places of Top@@ het@@ h , which is in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , to bur@@ n their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the fire ; which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be called Top@@ het@@ h , nor The val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but The val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter : for they shall bur@@ y in Top@@ het@@ h , until there is no place to bur@@ y .
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de ; for the land shall become a waste .
at that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves ;
I list@@ ened and heard , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ts him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a hor@@ se that rus@@ hes head@@ long in the battle .
therefore will I give their wi@@ ves to others , and their fields to those who shall poss@@ ess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; from the pro@@ phe@@ t even to the pri@@ est every one deals fal@@ sely .
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
they b@@ end their ton@@ gue , as their bo@@ w , for fal@@ se@@ hood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from ev@@ il to ev@@ il , and they don '@@ t know me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
who is the wise man , that may understand this ? who is he to whom the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken , that he may declare it ? why is the land per@@ ished and burned up like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , so that none passes through ?
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our pal@@ aces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the peoples are van@@ ity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man with the ax@@ e .
they are like a pal@@ m tree , of turned work , and don '@@ t speak : they must be carried , because they can '@@ t go . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of them ; for they can '@@ t do ev@@ il , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it ap@@ per@@ tains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the arti@@ fic@@ er and of the hands of the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h ; blue and pur@@ ple for their clo@@ thing ; they are all the work of s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful men .
he has made the ear@@ th by his power , he has established the world by his wis@@ dom , and by his understanding has he stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens :
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ nings for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
p@@ our out your wr@@ ath on the nations that don '@@ t know you , and on the families that don '@@ t call on your name : for they have dev@@ oured Jac@@ o@@ b , yes , they have dev@@ oured him and consu@@ med him , and have laid waste his habi@@ tation .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have you set up al@@ tar@@ s to the sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
for Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who plan@@ ted you , has pronounced ev@@ il against you , because of the ev@@ il of the house of Israel and of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , which they have worked for themselves in prov@@ oking me to an@@ ger by offering incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with you ; even they have cri@@ ed al@@ oud after you : D@@ on '@@ t believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have for@@ sak@@ en my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed of my sou@@ l into the hand of her enem@@ ies .
D@@ est@@ ro@@ yers have come on all the b@@ are he@@ ights in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; for the s@@ word of Yah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h has peace .
they have so@@ wn wheat , and have re@@ ap@@ ed thor@@ ns ; they have put themselves to p@@ ain , and profit nothing : and you shall be as@@ ha@@ med of your fru@@ its , because of the fierce an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h against all my ev@@ il neigh@@ b@@ ors , who touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it : be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them up from off their land , and will p@@ lu@@ ck up the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
it shall happen , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them up , I will return and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and du@@ g , and took the bel@@ t from the place where I had hidden it ; and be@@ hold , the bel@@ t was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
this ev@@ il people , who refuse to hear my words , who walk in the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of their heart , and are gone after other go@@ ds to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this bel@@ t , which is profitable for nothing .
I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fa@@ thers and the sons together , says Yah@@ we@@ h : I will not p@@ ity , nor spar@@ e , nor have comp@@ as@@ sion , that I should not destroy them .
give gl@@ ory to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , before he causes d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble on the dark mountains , and , while you look for light , he turns it into the shadow of death , and makes it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Ju@@ da@@ h is carried away cap@@ tive , all of it ; it is wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yo@@ ur@@ self ta@@ ught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
why should you be like a scar@@ ed man , as a m@@ igh@@ ty man who can '@@ t save ? yet you , Yah@@ we@@ h , are in the mid@@ st of us , and we are called by your name ; don '@@ t leave us .
the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them@@ -@@ -@@ them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess on them .
have you ut@@ ter@@ ly rejected Ju@@ da@@ h ? has your sou@@ l lo@@ ath@@ ed Z@@ ion ? why have you struck us , and there is no he@@ aling for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of he@@ aling , and be@@ hold , dis@@ may !
I will cause them to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
I have win@@ no@@ wed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused an@@ gu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who b@@ ore them , and concerning their fa@@ thers who became their father in this land :
neither shall men break bread for them in mourning , to comfor@@ t them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the c@@ up of con@@ so@@ lation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de .
it shall happen , when you shall show this people all these words , and they shall tell you , Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h pronounced all this great ev@@ il against us ? or what is our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yah@@ we@@ h our God ?
and you have done ev@@ il more than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , you walk every one after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his ev@@ il heart , so that you don '@@ t listen to me :
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fa@@ thers ; and there you shall serve other go@@ ds day and night ; for I will show you no fav@@ or .
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is en@@ gra@@ ved on the tab@@ let of their heart , and on the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
you , even of yo@@ ur@@ self , shall dis@@ continue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enem@@ ies in the land which you don '@@ t know : for you have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in my an@@ ger which shall bur@@ n fore@@ ver .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a salt land and not inhabited .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge that s@@ its on eg@@ gs which she has not laid , so is he who gets ri@@ ches , and not by right ; in the mid@@ st of his days they shall leave him , and at his end he shall be a fo@@ ol .
thus said Yah@@ we@@ h to me : go , and stand in the gate of the children of the people , through which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
it shall happen , if you dil@@ ig@@ ently listen to me , says Yah@@ we@@ h , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , but to make the Sab@@ b@@ ath day hol@@ y , to do no work there@@ in ;
they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places around Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the low@@ land , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and me@@ al offer@@ ings , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
when the ves@@ sel that he made of the cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter , he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is ev@@ il in my sight , that they not obe@@ y my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and give them over to the power of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves become ch@@ ild@@ less , and wi@@ dows ; and let their men be sla@@ in of death , and their young men struck of the s@@ word in battle .
and go forth to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the gate Har@@ s@@ ith , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell you ;
and have built the high places of Ba@@ al , to bur@@ n their sons in the fire for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Ba@@ al ; which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the ear@@ th .
I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and they shall eat everyone the f@@ les@@ h of his friend , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress , with which their enem@@ ies , and those who seek their life , shall dist@@ ress them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which are def@@ iled , shall be as the place of Top@@ het@@ h , even all the houses on whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se to all the army of the sky , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds .
then P@@ ash@@ hur struck Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the up@@ per gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
moreover I will give all the ri@@ ches of this city , and all its gains , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall make them a pre@@ y , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chal@@ de@@ ans who bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y .
be@@ hold , I am against you , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and of the rock of the pla@@ in , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; you that say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
say , He@@ ar the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken ves@@ sel ? is he a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts ? why are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into the land which they don '@@ t know ?
I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and multi@@ ply .
concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets . my heart within me is broken , all my b@@ ones shake ; I am like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because of his hol@@ y words .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , away from my presence :
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , like the fig@@ s that are first @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ pe ; and the other bas@@ ket had very bad fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : like these good fig@@ s , so will I regard the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for good .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
I will even give them up to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th for ev@@ il ; to be a re@@ pro@@ ach and a pro@@ ver@@ b , a ta@@ un@@ t and a cur@@ se , in all places where I shall drive them .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h ( the same was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) ,
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to this day , these twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not list@@ ened .
Yah@@ we@@ h has sent to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not list@@ ened , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear )
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the lam@@ p .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to me : take this c@@ up of the wine of wr@@ ath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and its kings , and its pr@@ inces , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , a his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se , as it is this day ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Gaza , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
a no@@ ise shall come even to the end of the ear@@ th ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all f@@ les@@ h : as for the w@@ ic@@ ked , he will give them to the s@@ word , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the sla@@ in of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung on the sur@@ face of the ground .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : stand in the court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and speak to all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , which come to worship in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , all the words that I command you to speak to them ; don '@@ t dimin@@ ish a word .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to listen to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not list@@ ened ;
it happened , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him to speak to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall su@@ rely die .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , they came up from the king 's house to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when U@@ ri@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , who killed him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , and to the king of T@@ y@@ re , and to the king of S@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers who come to Jer@@ usalem to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
I have made the ear@@ th , the men and the animals that are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
but as for you , don '@@ t you listen to your pro@@ ph@@ ets , nor to your di@@ vin@@ ers , nor to your dre@@ ams , nor to your so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , nor to your sor@@ cer@@ ers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
yes , thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and at Jer@@ usalem :
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ z@@ ur , the pro@@ phe@@ t , who was of Gi@@ be@@ on , spoke to me in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , with all the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , who went to Bab@@ yl@@ on , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; for I will break the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the bar from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) , saying ,
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : D@@ on '@@ t let your pro@@ ph@@ ets who are in the mid@@ st of you , and your di@@ vin@@ ers , dec@@ e@@ ive you ; neither listen to your dre@@ ams which you cause to be dre@@ amed .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , and concerning all the people who d@@ well in this city , your brothers who ha@@ ven '@@ t gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
Yah@@ we@@ h has made you pri@@ est in the place of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that there may be officers in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , for every man who is ma@@ d , and makes himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that you should put him in the sto@@ cks and in sh@@ ack@@ les .
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the Ne@@ he@@ lam@@ ite : because Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah has pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to you , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
all your lov@@ ers have forgotten you ; they don '@@ t seek you : for I have wounded you with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because your sin@@ s were increased .
therefore all those who dev@@ our you shall be dev@@ oured ; and all your ad@@ vers@@ aries , everyone of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and those who desp@@ oil you shall be a sp@@ oil , and all who pre@@ y on you will I give for a pre@@ y .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will turn again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on his d@@ wel@@ ling places ; and the city shall be built on its own hill , and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way .
out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of those who make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
their pr@@ ince shall be of themselves , and their ru@@ ler shall proceed from their mid@@ st ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had bol@@ d@@ ness to approach to me ? says Yah@@ we@@ h .
again will I build you , and you shall be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : again you shall be ad@@ or@@ ned with your tam@@ bour@@ ines , and shall go forth in the dan@@ ces of those who make mer@@ ry .
they shall come with we@@ eping ; and with peti@@ tions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a stra@@ ight way in which they shall not st@@ um@@ ble ; for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
then shall the vir@@ gin re@@ jo@@ ice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfor@@ t them , and make them re@@ jo@@ ice from their sor@@ row .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I struck on my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , yes , even con@@ founded , because I b@@ ore the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of animal .
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : if heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , then will I also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
now at that time the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army was bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ing Jer@@ usalem ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : take these de@@ eds , this de@@ ed of the purchase which is sealed , and this de@@ ed which is open , and put them in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel ; that they may continue many days .
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror ;
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done only that which was ev@@ il in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
for this city has been to me a provoc@@ ation of my an@@ ger and of my wr@@ ath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I ta@@ ught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not list@@ ened to receive in@@ struction .
now therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my an@@ ger , and in my wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they may not de@@ part from me .
moreover the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the low@@ land , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
as the army of the sky can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed , neither the s@@ and of the sea meas@@ ured ; so will I multi@@ ply the se@@ ed of David my ser@@ vant , and the L@@ evi@@ tes who minister to me .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th that were under his domin@@ ion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , G@@ o , and speak to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and tell him , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire :
when the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army was fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish and against Az@@ ek@@ ah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h as for@@ ti@@ fied cities .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people who were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty to them ;
that every man should let his male ser@@ vant , and every man his female ser@@ vant , who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bon@@ d@@ servants of them , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but you turned and prof@@ an@@ ed my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom you had let go free at their pleas@@ ure , to return ; and you brought them into subj@@ ection , to be to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , who have gone away from you .
go to the house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
we have obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , our father , in all that he comman@@ ded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , or our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
but it happened , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans ; so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
take a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah ; and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the s@@ cr@@ oll , which you have written from my m@@ outh , the words of Yah@@ we@@ h in the e@@ ars of the people in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h who come out of their cities .
now it happened in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h to Jer@@ usalem , proclaimed a fast before Yah@@ we@@ h .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the room of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , the s@@ cri@@ be , in the up@@ per court , at the entry of the new gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's room : and be@@ hold , all the pr@@ inces were sitting there , E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the s@@ cr@@ oll in the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be ; and they told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to get the s@@ cr@@ oll ; and he took it out of the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be . J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces who stood bes@@ ide the king .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ udi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the pen@@ k@@ ni@@ fe , and cast it into the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier , until all the s@@ cr@@ oll was consu@@ med in the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier .
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the s@@ cr@@ oll , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h : he shall have none to sit on the th@@ r@@ one of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to me to inqu@@ ire of me : be@@ hold , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
the pr@@ inces were angry with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be ; for they had made that the prison .
She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Mat@@ tan , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , and Ju@@ cal the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and P@@ ash@@ hur the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , heard the words that Jerem@@ i@@ ah spoke to all the people , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , He who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y , and he shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah san@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed@@ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , a e@@ un@@ u@@ ch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the fam@@ ine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
so E@@ bed@@ me@@ le@@ ch took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treas@@ ury , and took there ra@@ gs and worn @@@ -@@ @ out gar@@ ments , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with the cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver you . obe@@ y , I be@@ g you , the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your sou@@ l shall live .
they shall bring out all your wi@@ ves and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the pr@@ inces to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had comman@@ ded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jer@@ usalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on and all his army against Jer@@ usalem , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it ;
it happened that , when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Ara@@ bah .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the resi@@ due of the people who remained in the city , the de@@ ser@@ ters also who fell away to him , and the resi@@ due of the people who remained .
but Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will su@@ rely save you , and you shall not fall by the s@@ word , but your life shall be for a pre@@ y to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all the cap@@ tives of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , who were carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
then they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an and Jon@@ athan the sons of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th , and the sons of Ep@@ hai the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ite , they and their men .
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , to stand before the Chal@@ de@@ ans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fru@@ its and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the children of Am@@ mon , and in E@@ dom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they ate bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and killed him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also killed all the Jews who were with him , with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were found there , the men of war .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah killed them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
now it happened that , when all the people who were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t said to them , I have heard you ; be@@ hold , I will pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h your God according to your words ; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yah@@ we@@ h shall answer you , I will declare it to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be ev@@ il , we will obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up ; for I gri@@ eve over the dist@@ ress that I have brought on you .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
then it shall happen , that the s@@ word , which you fear , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt ; and the fam@@ ine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully against your own so@@ ul@@ s ; for you sent me to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , saying , pra@@ y for us to Yah@@ we@@ h our God ; and according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
it happened that , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Yah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mort@@ ar in the bri@@ ck work , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at Mem@@ p@@ his , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
have you forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves which they committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish those who d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
then all the men who knew that their wi@@ ves burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and all the women who stood by , a great assembly , even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt , in P@@ ath@@ ros , answ@@ ered Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
so that Yah@@ we@@ h could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without inhabi@@ tant , as it is this day .
be@@ hold , I watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good ; and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h who are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t spoke to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he wrote these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
of Egypt : concerning the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
why have I seen it ? they are dis@@ may@@ ed and are turned back@@ ward ; and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and have fled Ap@@ ace , and don '@@ t look back : terror is on every side , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the nations have heard of your sh@@ ame , and the ear@@ th is full of your cry ; for the m@@ igh@@ ty man has stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , they are fallen both of them together .
he made many to st@@ um@@ ble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men in the mid@@ st of her are like cal@@ ves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand : for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity has come on them , the time of their vis@@ itation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but don '@@ t you be afraid , Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed , Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save you from af@@ ar , and your se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong ones , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers don '@@ t look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
for by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with contin@@ ual we@@ eping shall they go up ; for at the des@@ cent of Hor@@ on@@ aim they have heard the dist@@ ress of the cry of destruction .
Mo@@ a@@ b has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his le@@ es , and has not been emp@@ tied from ves@@ sel to ves@@ sel , neither has he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his tas@@ te remains in him , and his s@@ cent is not changed .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will send to him those who p@@ our off , and they shall p@@ our him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les in pieces .
with more than the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er will I we@@ ep for you , v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of Jaz@@ er : on your summer fru@@ its and on your vin@@ t@@ age the destro@@ yer is fallen .
he who fle@@ es from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he who gets up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring on him , even on Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon ; for a fire is gone forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and has dev@@ oured the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
be@@ hold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neigh@@ b@@ ors ; and he is no more .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , they to whom it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t per@@ tain to drink of the c@@ up shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go un@@ punished ? you shall not go un@@ punished , but you shall su@@ rely drink .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread out his w@@ ings against Boz@@ ra@@ h : and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
their ca@@ me@@ ls shall be a bo@@ o@@ ty , and the multi@@ tude of their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck a sp@@ oil : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter to all winds those who have the cor@@ ners of their be@@ ards cut off ; and I will bring their cal@@ am@@ ity from every side of them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
on E@@ lam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will sc@@ at@@ ter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the out@@ casts of E@@ lam shall not come .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
your mother shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly disappointed ; she who b@@ ore you shall be con@@ founded : be@@ hold , she shall be the least of the nations , a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him who hand@@ les the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
in those days , and in that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sin@@ s of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall not be found : for I will par@@ don them whom I leave as a re@@ mn@@ ant .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Bab@@ yl@@ on , and you w@@ eren '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h has opened his arm@@ ory , and has brought forth the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation ; for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , has a work to do in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
a s@@ word is on their hor@@ ses , and on their char@@ i@@ ots , and on all the mixed people who are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is on her treasures , and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
therefore the wild animals of the de@@ sert with the w@@ ol@@ ves shall d@@ well there , and the os@@ tri@@ ches shall d@@ well there@@ in : and it shall be no more inhabited fore@@ ver ; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation .
they lay hold on bo@@ w and spe@@ ar ; they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy ; their voice ro@@ ars like the sea ; and they ride on hor@@ ses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , even the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
against him who ben@@ ds let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him who lif@@ ts himself up in his co@@ at of mail : and don '@@ t spar@@ e her young men ; ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all her army .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Yah@@ we@@ h 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der to her a re@@ compen@@ se .
make sharp the ar@@ ro@@ ws ; hold firm the shi@@ elds : Yah@@ we@@ h has s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of the kings of the Me@@ des ; because his purpose is against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to destroy it : for it is the ven@@ ge@@ ance of Yah@@ we@@ h , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ ning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
and with you will I break in pieces the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the far@@ mer and his yok@@ e ; and with you will I break in pieces govern@@ ors and deputies .
the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Bab@@ yl@@ on have for@@ bor@@ ne to fight , they remain in their stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; their might has failed ; they are become as women : her d@@ wel@@ ling places are set on fire ; her bars are broken .
her cities are become a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert , a land in which no man d@@ wel@@ ls , neither does any son of man pass there@@ by .
I will exec@@ ute judgment on B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he has sw@@ allowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , that I will exec@@ ute judgment on the en@@ gra@@ ved images of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and her whole land shall be con@@ founded ; and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
for through the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h it happened in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence . Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem :
and he burned the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the poorest of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their br@@ ass to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the captain of the guard took away the c@@ ups , the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , the po@@ ts , the lam@@ p@@ stands , the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the bo@@ w@@ ls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
they took the two pil@@ lars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bul@@ ls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
a capital of br@@ ass was on it ; and the he@@ ight of the one capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , with network and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on the capital all around , all of br@@ ass : and the second pil@@ lar also had like these , and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his allow@@ ance , there was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him by the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ s bit@@ ter@@ ly in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks ; among all her lov@@ ers she has none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her ; they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ad@@ versary has spread out his hand on all her pleas@@ ant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , concerning whom you comman@@ ded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my b@@ ones , and it prev@@ ails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me de@@ so@@ late and fa@@ int all the day .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand ; They are k@@ n@@ it together , they have come up on my nec@@ k ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger ! he has cast down from heav@@ en to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , An@@ d has@@ n '@@ t remember@@ ed his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger .
the Lord has sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has thrown down in his wr@@ ath the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has prof@@ an@@ ed the k@@ ing@@ dom and its pr@@ inces .
he has b@@ ent his bo@@ w like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an ad@@ versary , H@@ as killed all that were pleas@@ ant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Z@@ ion he has p@@ oured out his wr@@ ath like fire .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has sw@@ allowed up Israel ; He has sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces , he has destroyed his stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; He has multi@@ p@@ lied in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the Lord has cast off his alt@@ ar , he has ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces : they have made a no@@ ise in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n assembly .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit on the ground , they keep sil@@ ence ; They have cast up d@@ ust on their heads ; they have clo@@ th@@ ed themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my heart is troubled ; My li@@ ver is p@@ oured on the ear@@ th , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Bec@@ ause the young children and the inf@@ ants s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h has done that which he pur@@ posed ; he has fulfilled his word that he comman@@ ded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has caused the enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over you ; he has ex@@ al@@ ted the Hor@@ n of your ad@@ vers@@ aries .
their heart cri@@ ed to the Lord : Wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night ; Gi@@ ve yo@@ ur@@ self no res@@ p@@ ite ; don '@@ t let the app@@ le of your eye ce@@ ase .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the wat@@ ches ; p@@ our out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that fa@@ int for hunger at the head of every street .
look , Yah@@ we@@ h , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are d@@ and@@ led in the hands ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be killed in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word : you have killed them in the day of your an@@ ger ; you have sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
the ton@@ gue of the nur@@ sing child cl@@ ings to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
those who are killed with the s@@ word are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through , for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the kings of the ear@@ th di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe , neither all the inhabitants of the world , That the ad@@ versary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h has sc@@ at@@ tered them ; he will no more regard them : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect the persons of the pri@@ ests , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fav@@ or the el@@ ders .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ well in the land of U@@ z : the c@@ up shall pass through to you also ; you shall be dr@@ un@@ ken , and shall make yo@@ ur@@ self nak@@ ed .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its mid@@ st came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . this was their appearance : they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot ; and they spar@@ k@@ led like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , like the appearance of tor@@ ches : the fire went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
wher@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them ; for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
under the exp@@ ans@@ e were their w@@ ings stra@@ ight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
when they went , I heard the no@@ ise of their w@@ ings like the no@@ ise of great waters , like the voice of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , a no@@ ise of t@@ um@@ ult like the no@@ ise of an army : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward ; and from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness around him .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house ) , yet shall know that there has been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
not to many peoples of a st@@ range speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . su@@ rely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
I heard the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures as they touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them , even the no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was strong on me .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
but you , son of man , be@@ hold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bin@@ d you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your ton@@ gue stick to the ro@@ of of your m@@ outh , that you shall be m@@ ute , and shall not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
but when I speak with you , I will open your m@@ outh , and you shall tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : he who he@@ ars , let him hear ; and he who for@@ be@@ ars , let him for@@ bear : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build for@@ ts against it , and cast up a mo@@ und against it ; set camps also against it , and plant bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it all around .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for I have appointed the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred n@@ in@@ ety days : so you shall bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
you , son of man , take a sharp s@@ word ; You shall take it as a Bar@@ ber 's ra@@ zor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your be@@ ard : then take balan@@ ces to we@@ igh , and divide the ha@@ ir .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebel@@ led against my ord@@ inan@@ ces in doing w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and against my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and as for my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you are turbul@@ ent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my ord@@ inan@@ ces , neither have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you ;
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of you , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you ; and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ at@@ ter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely , because you have def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all your de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all your ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish you ; neither shall my eye spar@@ e , and I also will have no p@@ ity .
when I shall send on them the ev@@ il ar@@ ro@@ ws of fam@@ ine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the fam@@ ine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to the mountains and to the hil@@ ls , to the water@@ courses and to the val@@ ley@@ s : be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word on you , and I will destroy your high places .
he who is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he who is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he who remains and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my wr@@ ath on them .
my eye shall not spar@@ e you , neither will I have p@@ ity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you ; and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mo@@ an@@ ing , every one in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be prof@@ an@@ ed .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h fell there on me .
then I saw , and be@@ hold , a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward , fire ; and from his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , nor@@ th@@ ward of the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
there stood before them sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the house of Israel ; and in their mid@@ st stood Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , every man with his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and the odor of the cl@@ oud of incen@@ se went up .
he brought me into the in@@ ner court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and see , at the door of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five men , with their backs toward Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and their faces toward the east ; and they were wor@@ shipping the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in wr@@ ath ; my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity ; and though they cry in my e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , yet will I not hear them .
the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark on the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry over all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that are done in its mid@@ st .
then I looked , and see , in the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m there appeared above them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h moun@@ ted up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who took it and went out .
I looked , and be@@ hold , four whe@@ els bes@@ ide the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , one whe@@ el bes@@ ide one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el bes@@ ide another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b ; and the appearance of the whe@@ els was like a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes all around , even the whe@@ els that the four of them had .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight when they went forth , and the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
as for the lik@@ eness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : for you have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have you executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their f@@ les@@ h , and will give them a heart of f@@ les@@ h ;
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spiri@@ t of God into Chal@@ de@@ a , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , you d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the rebel@@ li@@ ous house , who have eyes to see , and don '@@ t see , who have e@@ ars to hear , and don '@@ t hear ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
in their sight you shall bear it on your sho@@ ul@@ der , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don '@@ t see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for removing , and in the even I du@@ g through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and b@@ ore it on my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are ; and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
you have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , W@@ here is the plas@@ ter with which you have plas@@ tered it ?
so will I break down the wall that you have plas@@ tered with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consu@@ med in its mid@@ st : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have gri@@ ev@@ ed the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , and be sav@@ ed alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , for a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has dev@@ oured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
as for your birth , in the day you were born your nav@@ el was not cut , neither were you was@@ hed in water to cleans@@ e you ; you w@@ eren '@@ t sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
no eye p@@ iti@@ ed you , to do any of these things to you , to have comp@@ as@@ sion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was ab@@ hor@@ red , in the day that you were born .
I caused you to multi@@ ply as that which gro@@ ws in the field , and you increased and grew great , and you at@@ tained to excellent or@@ nament ; your bre@@ asts were fas@@ hi@@ oned , and your ha@@ ir was grown ; yet you were nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
thus you were dec@@ ked with gold and silver ; and your clo@@ thing was of fine lin@@ en , and sil@@ k , and em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work ; you ate fine fl@@ our , and hon@@ ey , and oil ; and you were exceeding beautiful , and you prosp@@ ered to royal estate .
you took of your gar@@ ments , and made for yo@@ ur@@ selves high places dec@@ ked with various col@@ ors , and played the pro@@ stitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
you also took your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yo@@ ur@@ self images of men , and played the pro@@ stitute with them ;
my bread also which I gave you , fine fl@@ our , and oil , and hon@@ ey , with which I f@@ ed you , you even set it before them for a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a ; and [ thus ] it was , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
that you have sla@@ in my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
you have also committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , your neigh@@ b@@ ors , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and have multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , Bec@@ ause your fil@@ th@@ iness was p@@ oured out , and your nak@@ edn@@ ess uncovered through your prostitution with your lov@@ ers ; and because of all the id@@ ols of your ab@@ omin@@ ations , and for the blood of your children , that you gave to them ;
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your va@@ ulted place , and break down your lo@@ f@@ ty places ; and they shall stri@@ p you of your clo@@ th@@ es , and take your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s ; and they shall leave you nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
they shall bur@@ n your houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to ce@@ ase from playing the pro@@ stitute , and you shall also give no h@@ ire any more .
so will I cause my wr@@ ath toward you to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
you are the daughter of your mother , who lo@@ ath@@ es her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your s@@ ist@@ ers , who lo@@ ath@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was a H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
your el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your left hand , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their mid@@ st ;
that you may bear your own sh@@ ame , and may be as@@ ha@@ med because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfor@@ t to them .
your s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
then you shall remember your ways , and be as@@ ha@@ med , when you shall receive your s@@ ist@@ ers , your el@@ der [ s@@ ist@@ ers ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , but not by your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
that you may remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open your m@@ outh any more , because of your sh@@ ame , when I have for@@ given you all that you have done , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
he cro@@ pped off the top@@ most of the young tw@@ ig@@ s of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely in the place where the king d@@ wel@@ ls who made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant he broke , even with him in the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on he shall die .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will enter into judgment with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he has t@@ res@@ passed against me .
all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the s@@ word , and those who remain shall be sc@@ at@@ tered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and bear fruit , and be a good@@ ly c@@ ed@@ ar : and under it shall d@@ well all birds of every wing ; in the sha@@ de of its branches shall they d@@ well .
and has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither has def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
and has not wron@@ ged any , but has restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , has taken nothing by rob@@ bery , has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
neither has wron@@ ged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by rob@@ bery , but has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , has walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked turn from all his sin@@ s that he has committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their p@@ it .
they put him in a c@@ age with ho@@ oks , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; they brought him into stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it happened in the seventh year , in the fifth [ month ] , the tenth [ day ] of the month , that certain of the el@@ ders of Israel came to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , and sat before me .
son of man , speak to the el@@ ders of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : is it to inqu@@ ire of me that you have come ? as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , I will not be inqu@@ ired of by you .
and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day when I chose Israel , and s@@ wor@@ e to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I s@@ wor@@ e to them , saying , I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ;
in that day I s@@ wor@@ e to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
I said to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , D@@ on '@@ t walk in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their ord@@ inan@@ ces , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out , will I be king over you :
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out ;
like as I entered into judgment with your fa@@ thers in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and those who dis@@ obe@@ y against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
for in my hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the first fru@@ its of your offer@@ ings , with all your hol@@ y things .
as a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been sc@@ at@@ tered ; and I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in you in the sight of the nations .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , in which you have pollu@@ ted yo@@ ur@@ selves ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that you have committed .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the forest of the field in the South ;
it is given to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : the s@@ word , it is shar@@ pen@@ ed , yes , it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the kil@@ ler .
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : remove the tur@@ ban , and take off the cro@@ wn ; this [ shall be ] no more the same ; ex@@ alt that which is low , and ab@@ ase that which is high .
cause it to return into its she@@ ath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will p@@ our out my in@@ dign@@ ation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wr@@ ath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful to destroy .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the mid@@ st of you have they dealt by op@@ pression with the foreig@@ ner ; in you have they wron@@ ged the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
one has committed ab@@ omin@@ ation with his neigh@@ bor 's wife ; and another has le@@ w@@ dly def@@ iled his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; and another in you has hum@@ b@@ led his sister , his father 's daughter .
be@@ hold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dis@@ honest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the mid@@ st of you .
there is a con@@ spir@@ acy of her pro@@ ph@@ ets in its mid@@ st , like a ro@@ aring lion ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y : they have dev@@ oured so@@ ul@@ s ; they take treasure and pre@@ ci@@ ous things ; they have made her wi@@ dows many in its mid@@ st .
and they played the pro@@ stitute in Egypt ; they played the pro@@ stitute in their youth ; there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there was handled the bos@@ om of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ gin@@ ity ; and they p@@ oured out their prostitution on her .
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you h@@ ate , into the hand of them from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ a@@ w the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your bre@@ asts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
for they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ ore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be dev@@ oured .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall kill their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and also a p@@ ile [ of wood ] for the b@@ ones under [ the cal@@ dr@@ on ] ; make it bo@@ il well ; yes , let its b@@ ones be bo@@ iled in its mid@@ st .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city , to the cal@@ dr@@ on whose rust is there@@ in , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
then set it empty on its co@@ als , that it may be hot , and its br@@ ass may bur@@ n , and that its fil@@ th@@ iness may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that its rust may be consu@@ med .
she has we@@ ar@@ ied [ her@@ self ] with to@@ il ; yet her great rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go forth out of her ; her rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t [ go forth ] by fire .
in your fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have cleans@@ ed you and you w@@ eren '@@ t cleans@@ ed , you shall not be cleans@@ ed from your fil@@ th@@ iness any more , until I have caused my wr@@ ath toward you to rest .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their en@@ camp@@ ments in you , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth J@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al Me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Am@@ mon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Am@@ mon may not be remember@@ ed among the nations .
she shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will bring on T@@ y@@ re Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , king of kings , from the north , with hor@@ ses , and with char@@ i@@ ots , and with hor@@ se@@ men , and a company , and many people .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the s@@ word ; and the pil@@ lars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a sp@@ oil of your ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleas@@ ant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your tim@@ ber and your d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the waters .
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay aside their rob@@ es , and stri@@ p off their em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at you .
the old men of Ge@@ bal and the wise men of it were in you your rep@@ air@@ ers of ship se@@ ams : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in you to deal in your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they were the mer@@ chan@@ ts of your hand ; in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats , in these were they your mer@@ chan@@ ts .
all who handled the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , [ and ] all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust on their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
in their w@@ ailing they shall take up a lament@@ ation for you , and la@@ ment over you , [ saying ] , Wh@@ o is there like T@@ y@@ re , like her who is brought to sil@@ ence in the mid@@ st of the sea ?
therefore , be@@ hold , I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers on you , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring you down to the p@@ it ; and you shall die the death of those who are sla@@ in , in the heart of the seas .
you were the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the hol@@ y mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have cor@@ rupted your wis@@ dom by reason of your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they d@@ well in their own land which I gave to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely there@@ in ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , when I have executed judg@@ ments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
I will put ho@@ oks in your j@@ a@@ ws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scal@@ es ; and I will bring you up out of the mid@@ st of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scal@@ es .
I 'll cast you forth into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won '@@ t be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the ear@@ th and to the birds of the sky .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and t@@ ore all their sho@@ ul@@ ders ; and when they le@@ an@@ ed on you , you broke , and paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed all of their th@@ igh@@ s . "
therefore , be@@ hold , I am against you , and against your rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt an ut@@ ter waste and de@@ so@@ lation , from the to@@ wer of Sev@@ en@@ e@@ h even to the border of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
I will make the land of Egypt a de@@ so@@ lation in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a de@@ so@@ lation for@@ ty years ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries . "
and I will bring back the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the base of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will give the land of Egypt to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and he shall carry off her multi@@ tude , and take her sp@@ oil , and take her pre@@ y ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause a Hor@@ n to bu@@ d forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the m@@ outh in their mid@@ st ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , and P@@ ut , and Lu@@ d , and all the mixed people , and Cu@@ b , and the children of the land that is al@@ lied with them , shall fall with them by the s@@ word .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from before me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid ; and there shall be an@@ gu@@ ish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , be@@ hold , it comes .
I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and will sell the land into the hand of ev@@ il men ; and I will make the land de@@ so@@ late , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause the images to ce@@ ase from Mem@@ p@@ his ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
it happened in the ele@@ venth year , in the first [ month ] , in the seventh [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and be@@ hold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ he@@ aling ] medicin@@ es , to put a ban@@ da@@ ge to bin@@ d it , that it be strong to hold the s@@ word .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the s@@ word to fall out of his hand .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break the arms of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore its stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field ; and its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nes@@ ts in its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I will even deliver him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the nations ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
S@@ tran@@ gers , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the val@@ ley@@ s his branches are fallen , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are broken by all the water@@ courses of the land ; and all the peoples of the ear@@ th are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
they also went down into She@@ ol with him to those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the nations .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole ear@@ th with you .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you sw@@ im , even to the mountains ; and the water@@ courses shall be full of you .
when I shall ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish you , I will cover the heav@@ ens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause your multi@@ tude to fall ; the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multi@@ tude shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late and waste , a land de@@ stitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the ear@@ th , with those who go down into the p@@ it .
whose graves are set in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the p@@ it , and her company is around her grave ; all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her pr@@ inces , who in their might are laid with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the p@@ it .
for I have put his terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the mid@@ st of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his multi@@ tude , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the s@@ word on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watch@@ man ;
nevertheless , if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his way ; he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
when I tell the righ@@ te@@ ous , that he shall su@@ rely live ; if he trust to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , none of his righ@@ te@@ ous de@@ eds shall be remember@@ ed ; but in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity that he has committed , there@@ in shall he die .
if the w@@ ic@@ ked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by rob@@ bery , walk in the stat@@ utes of life , committing no in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jer@@ usalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
I will make the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment ; and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , so that none shall pass through .
be@@ hold , you are to them as a very lov@@ ely song of one who has a pleas@@ ant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don '@@ t do them .
you ha@@ ven '@@ t strengthened the dis@@ eased , neither have you he@@ aled that which was si@@ ck , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with ri@@ gor you have ruled over them .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely because my she@@ ep became a pre@@ y , and my she@@ ep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my she@@ ep , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fe@@ ed my she@@ ep ;
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will fe@@ ed them on the mountains of Israel , by the water@@ courses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will fe@@ ed them with good pas@@ ture ; and on the mountains of the he@@ ight of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed on the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but the f@@ at and the strong I will destroy ; I will fe@@ ed them in justice .
does it seem a small thing to you to have f@@ ed on the good pas@@ ture , but you must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ ture ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the clear waters , but you must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
as for my she@@ ep , they eat that which you have tro@@ dden with your feet , and they drink that which you have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
I will make them and the places around my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in its season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the nations , neither shall the animals of the ear@@ th dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plan@@ tation for ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with fam@@ ine in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpet@@ ual en@@ mity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the end ;
I will fill its mountains with its sla@@ in : in your hil@@ ls and in your val@@ ley@@ s and in all your water@@ courses shall they fall who are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
neither will I let you hear any more the sh@@ ame of the nations , neither shall you bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to st@@ um@@ ble any more , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you a heart of f@@ les@@ h .
then you shall remember your ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me out in the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley ; and it was full of b@@ ones .
therefore pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
you , son of man , take one stick , and write on it , For Ju@@ da@@ h , and for the children of Israel his compan@@ ions : then take another stick , and write on it , For Joseph , the stick of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and [ for ] all the house of Israel his compan@@ ions :
say to them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all ;
they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , in which your fa@@ thers lived ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , they , and their children , and their children 's children , fore@@ ver : and David my ser@@ vant shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
you shall come from your place out of the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them ri@@ ding on hor@@ ses , a great company and a m@@ igh@@ ty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , that my wr@@ ath shall come up into my nos@@ tr@@ ils .
with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hor@@ des , and on the many peoples who are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and sul@@ f@@ ur .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hor@@ des , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be dev@@ oured .
my hol@@ y name will I make known in the mid@@ st of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my hol@@ y name to be prof@@ an@@ ed any more : and the nations shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall pl@@ under those who pl@@ under@@ ed them , and ro@@ b those who ro@@ bbed them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the under@@ tak@@ ers have buried it in the val@@ ley of Ham@@ on Go@@ g .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into cap@@ tivity for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because they t@@ res@@ passed against me , and I hi@@ d my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their ad@@ vers@@ aries , and they fell all of them by the s@@ word .
they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and all their t@@ res@@ passes by which they have t@@ res@@ passed against me , when they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , in that I caused them to go into cap@@ tivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , where@@ on was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one Re@@ ed broad .
then meas@@ ured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and its posts , two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cu@@ bit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cu@@ bit on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
[ from ] the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the gate at the entrance to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner por@@ ch of the gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court outside , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lo@@ dges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its ar@@ ches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the windows of it , and its ar@@ ches , and the pal@@ m trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its ar@@ ches were before them .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its ar@@ ches were before them ; and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
the ar@@ ches of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
outside of the in@@ ner gate were rooms for the singers in the in@@ ner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the pri@@ ests , the ke@@ epers of the duty of the alt@@ ar : these are the sons of Zad@@ ok , who from among the sons of L@@ evi come near to Yah@@ we@@ h to minister to him .
then he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and meas@@ ured each post of the por@@ ch , five cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side : and the b@@ read@@ th of the gate was three cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tent .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts all around .
he meas@@ ured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its gal@@ ler@@ ies on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the in@@ ner temp@@ le , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
the th@@ res@@ holds , and the closed windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ce@@ il@@ ings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
so that there was the face of a man toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
as for the temp@@ le , the door posts were s@@ quar@@ ed ; and as for the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temp@@ le ] .
the doors had two leaves [ ap@@ i@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temp@@ le , ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m and pal@@ m trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the por@@ ch outside .
there were closed windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the th@@ res@@ holds .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
over against the twenty [ cu@@ bi@@ ts ] which belonged to the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which belonged to the ou@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in the third story .
now when he had made an end of measuring the in@@ ner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and meas@@ ured it all around .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their do@@ or@@ post bes@@ ide my do@@ or@@ post , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have def@@ iled my hol@@ y name by their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed : therefore I have consu@@ med them in my an@@ ger .
the ledge shall be fo@@ ur@@ teen [ cu@@ bi@@ ts ] long by fo@@ ur@@ teen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cu@@ bit ; and its bottom shall be a cu@@ bit around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
you shall give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes who are of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , a young bul@@ l for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four hor@@ ns of it , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleans@@ e it and make At@@ on@@ ement for it .
as for the pr@@ ince , he shall sit there@@ in as pr@@ ince to eat bread before Yah@@ we@@ h ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and I fell on my face .
in that you have brought in foreigners , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to prof@@ ane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , [ to add ] to all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
because they minist@@ ered to them before their id@@ ols , and became a stumbling block of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , and they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall not come near to me , to exec@@ ute the office of pri@@ est to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , to the things that are most hol@@ y ; but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
they shall have lin@@ en ti@@ res on their heads , and shall have lin@@ en bre@@ eches on their wa@@ ists ; they shall not clo@@ the themselves with [ anything that causes ] swe@@ at .
neither shall they take for their wi@@ ves a wi@@ dow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take vir@@ g@@ ins of the se@@ ed of the house of Israel , or a wi@@ dow who is the wi@@ dow of a pri@@ est .
they shall go in to no dead person to def@@ ile themselves ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister who has had no husband , they may def@@ ile themselves .
the first of all the first fru@@ its of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offer@@ ings , shall be for the pri@@ est : you shall also give to the pri@@ ests the first of your d@@ ough , to cause a b@@ les@@ sing to rest on your house .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , you shall offer an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , a hol@@ y portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand [ re@@ eds ] , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand : it shall be hol@@ y in all its border all around .
it is a hol@@ y portion of the land ; it shall be for the pri@@ ests , the ministers of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , who come near to minister to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a hol@@ y place for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
and the set portion of oil , of the b@@ ath of oil , the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , [ which is ] ten ba@@ ths , even a Ho@@ mer ; ( for ten ba@@ ths are a Ho@@ mer ; )
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h ; and you shall cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge of the alt@@ ar , and on the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the me@@ al offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : the gate of the in@@ ner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram ; they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h :
when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y rooms for the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and be@@ hold , there was a place on the hin@@ der part w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me round by the way outside to the ou@@ ter gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the k@@ ne@@ es . again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the wa@@ ist .
it shall happen , that fisher@@ men shall stand by it : from En Ge@@ di even to En Eg@@ la@@ im shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have subur@@ bs : toward the north two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred fif@@ ty .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the pr@@ ince .
by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar to the waters of Mer@@ ib@@ ath K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one ; the gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , with their three gates : the gate of G@@ ad , one ; the gate of As@@ her , one ; the gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , one .
the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties , and of the wine which he d@@ rank , and that they should be no@@ ur@@ ished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , [ of ] Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the you@@ ths who eat of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the en@@ chan@@ ters , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , to tell the king his dre@@ ams . so they came in and stood before the king .
therefore Daniel went in to Ari@@ o@@ ch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; he went and said thus to him : D@@ on '@@ t destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; bring me in before the king , and I will show to the king the interpre@@ tation .
then Ari@@ o@@ ch brought in Daniel before the king in has@@ te , and said thus to him , I have found a man of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , who will make known to the king the interpre@@ tation .
but there is a God in heav@@ en who reve@@ als secre@@ ts , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your th@@ ou@@ ghts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen her@@ e@@ after ; and he who reve@@ als secre@@ ts has made known to you what shall happen .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its bre@@ ast and its arms of silver , its bel@@ ly and its th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
and wher@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the Hor@@ n , fl@@ ute , z@@ ither , Ly@@ re , har@@ p , pip@@ e , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and wor@@ shi@@ ped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar full of fur@@ y , and the form of his appearance was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go : [ therefore ] he spoke , and comman@@ ded that they should heat the fur@@ n@@ ace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then these men were bound in their p@@ ants , their tun@@ ics , and their man@@ t@@ les , and their [ other ] gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the en@@ chan@@ ters , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpre@@ tation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and be@@ hold , a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th ; and its he@@ ight was great .
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed from it .
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of its roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habi@@ tation :
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the k@@ ing@@ dom has depar@@ ted from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of God 's house which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king and his lor@@ ds , his wi@@ ves and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank from them .
in the same hour came forth the fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lam@@ p@@ stand on the plas@@ ter of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him ; and the join@@ ts of his th@@ igh@@ s were lo@@ os@@ ened , and his k@@ ne@@ es struck one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Ar@@ e you that Daniel , who are of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom the king my father brought out of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
now the wise men , the en@@ chan@@ ters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpre@@ tation ; but they could not show the interpre@@ tation of the thing .
and because of the gre@@ at@@ ness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and fear@@ ed before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was har@@ dened so that he dealt pro@@ u@@ dly , he was de@@ posed from his k@@ ingly th@@ r@@ one , and they took his gl@@ ory from him :
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with pur@@ ple , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then answ@@ ered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very disp@@ le@@ ased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he la@@ bo@@ red until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sle@@ ep fled from him .
then was the king exceeding glad , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had tr@@ usted in his God .
I make a decree , that in all the domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and stead@@ fast fore@@ ver , H@@ is k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his domin@@ ion shall be even to the end .
the first was like a lion , and had e@@ ag@@ le 's w@@ ings : I saw until its w@@ ings were p@@ lu@@ cked , and it was lifted up from the ear@@ th , and made to stand on two feet as a man ; and a man 's heart was given to it .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sla@@ in , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and be@@ hold , there came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for the ten hor@@ ns , out of this k@@ ing@@ dom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
as I was considering , be@@ hold , a male go@@ at came from the west over the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t touch the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two hor@@ ns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fur@@ y of his power .
yes , it mag@@ ni@@ fied itself , even to the pr@@ ince of the army ; and it took away from him the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] through dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleas@@ ure ] and prosp@@ ered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was fri@@ gh@@ tened , and fell on my face : but he said to me , understand , son of man ; for the vision belongs to the time of the end .
his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er and do [ his pleas@@ ure ] ; and he shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty ones and the hol@@ y people .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosp@@ er in his hand ; and he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the pr@@ ince of pr@@ inces ; but he shall be broken without hand .
neither have we list@@ ened to your servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
as it is written in the law of Mos@@ es , all this ev@@ il has come on us : yet have we not ent@@ re@@ ated the fav@@ or of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , that we should turn from our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and have dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment in your truth .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and have gotten yo@@ ur@@ self ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
my God , turn your e@@ ar , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our peti@@ tions before you for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but for your great mer@@ cies ' sake .
yes , while I was speaking in pray@@ er , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sle@@ ep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me twenty @@@ -@@ @ one days ; but , be@@ hold , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there bre@@ ath left in me .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
but out of a sho@@ ot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail .
also their go@@ ds , with their m@@ ol@@ ten images , [ and ] with their good@@ ly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry cap@@ tive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
the king of the south shall be moved with an@@ ger , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north ; and he shall set forth a great multi@@ tude , and the multi@@ tude shall be given into his hand .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multi@@ tude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much sub@@ stance .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his re@@ pro@@ ach to turn on him .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collec@@ tor to pass through the k@@ ing@@ dom to maintain its gl@@ ory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in an@@ ger , nor in battle .
in his place shall stand up a con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble person , to whom they had not given the hon@@ or of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
then shall he return into his land with great sub@@ stance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] , and return to his own land .
for ships of Kit@@ tim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and shall return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the fortress , and shall take away the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and they shall set up the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many [ countries ] shall be over@@ thrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt ; and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
then I , Daniel , looked , and be@@ hold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
from the time that the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred n@@ in@@ ety days .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Hos@@ ea the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and make her b@@ are as in the day that she was born , and make her like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and kill her with thir@@ st .
I will lay waste her v@@ ines and her fi@@ g trees , about which she has said , ' These are my wages that my lov@@ ers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , ' and the animals of the field shall eat them .
I will visit on her the days of the Ba@@ als , to which she burned incen@@ se , when she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ got me , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will give her v@@ ine@@ yards from there , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will so@@ w her to me in the ear@@ th ; and I will have mer@@ cy on her who had not obtained mer@@ cy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
therefore the land will mour@@ n , and everyone who d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in will waste aw@@ ay@@ . all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they play the pro@@ stitute , nor your bri@@ des when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery ; because the men con@@ sort with pro@@ stitu@@ tes , and they sacrifice with the shr@@ ine pro@@ stitu@@ tes ; so the people without understanding will come to ru@@ in .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will become a de@@ so@@ lation in the day of re@@ bu@@ ke . among the tri@@ bes of Israel , I have made known that which will su@@ rely be .
for I will be to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
let us acknowledge Yah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Yah@@ we@@ h . as su@@ rely as the sun rises , Yah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the ear@@ th . "
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it . indeed , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there on him , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made pr@@ inces , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
for they so@@ w the wind , and they will re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind . he has no standing gra@@ in . the stal@@ k will yield no head . if it does yield , st@@ ran@@ gers will sw@@ allow it up .
" all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al ; for there I ha@@ ted them . because of the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their de@@ eds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their pr@@ inces are rebels .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yok@@ e on their nec@@ ks ; and I b@@ ent down to him and I f@@ ed him .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of my an@@ ger . I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of you ; and I will not come in wr@@ ath .
they will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and like the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman will come on him . he is an un@@ wise son ; for when it is time , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come to the opening of the w@@ om@@ b .
As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a can '@@ t save us . we won '@@ t ride on hor@@ ses ; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ' Our go@@ ds ! ' for in you the fa@@ ther@@ less finds mer@@ cy . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is pru@@ dent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Yah@@ we@@ h are right , and the righ@@ te@@ ous walk in them ; But the rebel@@ li@@ ous st@@ um@@ ble in them .
the v@@ ine has dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree with@@ ered ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all of the trees of the field are with@@ ered ; for joy has with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
a fire dev@@ ours before them , and behind them , a fla@@ me bur@@ ns . the land is as the gar@@ den of E@@ den before them , and behind them , a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ unders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obe@@ ys his command ; for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is great and very aw@@ es@@ ome , and who can en@@ dur@@ e it ?
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , you animals of the field ; for the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness spring up , for the tree be@@ ars its fruit . the fi@@ g tree and the v@@ ine yield their strength .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen after@@ ward , that I will p@@ our out my Spiri@@ t on all f@@ les@@ h ; and your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters will pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y . your old men will dream dre@@ ams . your young men will see visions .
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; and I will exec@@ ute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
" yes , and what are you to me , T@@ y@@ re , and S@@ id@@ on , and all the regions of Phil@@ isti@@ a ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swi@@ f@@ tly and spe@@ edil@@ y return your repayment on your own head .
and have sold the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hands of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they will sell them to the men of She@@ ba , to a far@@ away nation , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
it will happen in that day , that the mountains will drop down swe@@ et wine , the hil@@ ls will flow with milk , all the bro@@ oks of Ju@@ da@@ h will flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain will come forth from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
I will break the bar of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and cut off the inhabi@@ tant from the val@@ ley of Av@@ en , and him who holds the scep@@ ter from the house of E@@ den ; and the people of Syria shall go into cap@@ tivity to K@@ ir , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of the children of Am@@ mon , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have ri@@ pped open the pregn@@ ant women of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that they may en@@ large their border .
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it will dev@@ our its pal@@ aces , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have rejected Yah@@ we@@ h 's law , and have not kept his stat@@ utes , and their lies have led them as@@ tra@@ y , after which their fa@@ thers walked ;
neither shall he stand who hand@@ les the bo@@ w ; and he who is swift of fo@@ ot won '@@ t escape ; neither shall he who ri@@ des the hor@@ se deliver himself ;

" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
seek him who made the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades and Ori@@ on , and turns the shadow of death into the morning , and makes the day dark with night ; who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , Yah@@ we@@ h is his name ,
For@@ as@@ much therefore as you tr@@ amp@@ le on the poor , and take taxes from him of wheat : you have built houses of cut stone , but you will not d@@ well in them . you have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but you shall not drink their wine .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the Lord : " w@@ ailing will be in all the broad ways ; and they will say in all the streets , ' A@@ las ! A@@ las ! ' and they will call the far@@ mer to mourning , and those who are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in lament@@ ation to w@@ ailing .
Wo@@ e to those who are at ease in Z@@ ion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samar@@ ia , the no@@ table men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
who lie on beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves on their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
thus the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h showed me : and be@@ hold , he formed loc@@ ust@@ s in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and be@@ hold , it was the latter growth after the king 's har@@ v@@ est .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day .
though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and it will bi@@ te them .
for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , is he who tou@@ ches the land and it mel@@ ts , and all who d@@ well in it will mour@@ n ; and it will rise up wh@@ ol@@ ly like the River , and will s@@ ink again , like the River of Egypt .
it is he who buil@@ ds his rooms in the heav@@ ens , and has founded his va@@ ult on the ear@@ th ; he who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; Yah@@ we@@ h is his name .
" for , be@@ hold , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all the nations , as gra@@ in is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet not the least ker@@ nel will fall on the ear@@ th .
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
I will bring my people Israel back from cap@@ tivity , and they will rebuild the ru@@ ined cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat their fruit .
but don '@@ t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction . D@@ on '@@ t speak pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .

the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will be a fire , the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble . they will bur@@ n among them , and dev@@ our them . there will not be any remaining to the house of E@@ sa@@ u . " indeed , Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
the news reached the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and took off his royal ro@@ be , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , both man and animal , and let them cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the sha@@ de , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h God prepared a v@@ ine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a sha@@ de over his head , to deliver him from his dis@@ comfor@@ t . so Jon@@ ah was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad because of the v@@ ine .

all her id@@ ols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temp@@ le gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute has she gathered them , and to the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute shall they return . "
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yah@@ we@@ h at their head .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them , and break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their de@@ eds ev@@ il . "
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets who lead my people as@@ tra@@ y ; for those who fe@@ ed their te@@ eth , they procla@@ im , " Peace ! " and who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for their m@@ ou@@ ths , they prepare war against him :
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not div@@ ine ; and the sun will go down on the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day will be black over them .

therefore Z@@ ion for your sake will be p@@ low@@ ed like a field , and Jer@@ usalem will become he@@ aps of rub@@ ble , and the mountain of the temp@@ le like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and peoples will stream to it .
now you shall gather yo@@ ur@@ self in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a ro@@ d on the che@@ ek .
he shall stand , and shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d in the strength of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the ear@@ th .

you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your hum@@ iliation will be in your mid@@ st . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the s@@ word .
D@@ on '@@ t trust in a neigh@@ bor . D@@ on '@@ t put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your em@@ br@@ ace , be careful of the words of your m@@ outh !
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of Yah@@ we@@ h , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ leads my case , and execu@@ tes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
they will lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent . like cra@@ w@@ ling things of the ear@@ th they shall come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling out of their den@@ s . they will come with fear to Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and will be afraid because of you .
Yah@@ we@@ h is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty un@@ punished . Yah@@ we@@ h has his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .

your guards are like the loc@@ ust@@ s , and your officials like the s@@ war@@ ms of loc@@ ust@@ s , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun appears , they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .

their wealth will become a sp@@ oil , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation . yes , they will build houses , but won '@@ t in@@ ha@@ bit them . they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but won '@@ t drink their wine .

he answ@@ ered and spoke to those who stood before him , saying , " T@@ ake the fil@@ thy gar@@ ments off of him . " to him he said , " be@@ hold , I have caused your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to pass from you , and I will clo@@ the you with rich clo@@ thing . "
( and be@@ hold , a tal@@ ent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket . "
then lifted I up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there were two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings . now they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k , and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket between ear@@ th and the sky .
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the ear@@ th : and he said , " G@@ o around and through the ear@@ th ! " so they walked back and forth through the ear@@ th .
" take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , where they have come from Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and speak to him , saying , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " be@@ hold , the man whose name is the Bran@@ ch : and he shall grow up out of his place ; and he shall build Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le ;
even he shall build Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le ; and he shall bear the gl@@ ory , and shall sit and rule on his th@@ r@@ one ; and he shall be a pri@@ est on his th@@ r@@ one ; and the coun@@ sel of peace shall be between them both .
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the pri@@ ests , saying , ' When you fas@@ ted and mour@@ ned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these sev@@ enty years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " I have returned to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem . Jer@@ usalem shall be called ' The City of Tru@@ th ; ' and the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' The Holy Mountain . ' "
for before those days there was no wages for man , nor any wages for an animal ; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in , because of the ad@@ versary . for I set all men everyone against his neigh@@ bor .
" for the se@@ ed of peace and the v@@ ine will yield its fruit , and the ground will give its increase , and the heav@@ ens will give their dew ; and I will cause the re@@ mn@@ ant of this people to inher@@ it all these things .
it shall come to pass that , as you were a cur@@ se among the nations , house of Ju@@ da@@ h and house of Israel , so will I save you , and you shall be a b@@ les@@ sing . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . let your hands be strong . "
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will wri@@ the in ag@@ ony ; as will E@@ kr@@ on , for her expec@@ tation will be disappointed ; and the king will per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will not be inhabited .
for indeed I b@@ end Ju@@ da@@ h as a bo@@ w for me . I have filled the bo@@ w with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and I will stir up your sons , Z@@ ion , against your sons , Greece , and will make you like the s@@ word of a m@@ igh@@ ty man .
Yah@@ we@@ h their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the je@@ wel@@ s of a cro@@ wn , lifted on high over his land .
they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , t@@ reading down mu@@ d@@ dy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yah@@ we@@ h is with them ; and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses will be con@@ founded .
" I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back ; for I have mer@@ cy on them ; and they will be as though I had not cast them off : for I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and I will hear them .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .
he will pass through the sea of aff@@ li@@ ction , and will strike the waves in the sea , and all the dep@@ ths of the N@@ ile will d@@ ry up ; and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a will be brought down , and the scep@@ ter of Egypt will de@@ part .
for I will no more p@@ ity the inhabitants of the land , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " but , be@@ hold , I will deliver the men everyone into his neigh@@ bor 's hand , and into the hand of his king . they will strike the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them . "
then I said , " I will not fe@@ ed you . that which dies , let it die ; and that which is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let those who are left eat each other 's f@@ les@@ h . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " throw it to the P@@ ot@@ ter , the hand@@ some price that I was valued at by them ! " I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the P@@ ot@@ ter , in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jer@@ usalem a bur@@ den@@ some stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the ear@@ th will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I will strike every hor@@ se with terror , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will strike every hor@@ se of the peoples with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
it will come to pass in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they will be remember@@ ed no more . I will also cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the spirit of imp@@ urity to pass out of the land .
but he will say , ' I am no pro@@ phe@@ t , I am a til@@ ler of the ground ; for I have been made a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant from my youth . '
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
this will be the pla@@ gue with which Yah@@ we@@ h will strike all the peoples who have war@@ red against Jer@@ usalem : their f@@ les@@ h will consum@@ e away while they stand on their feet , and their eyes will consum@@ e away in their so@@ c@@ kets , and their ton@@ gue will consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neigh@@ bor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neigh@@ bor .
so will be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the don@@ key , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that pla@@ gue .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jer@@ usalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , and to keep the feast of ten@@ ts .
it will be , that who@@ ever of all the families of the ear@@ th do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go up to Jer@@ usalem to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , on them there will be no rain .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cut off , to the man who does this , him who w@@ akes and him who answers , out of the ten@@ ts of Jac@@ o@@ b , and him who offers an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
" be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he will prepare the way before me ; and the Lord , whom you seek , will su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to his temp@@ le ; and the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom you desire , be@@ hold , he comes ! " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
and he will sit as a refin@@ er and pur@@ i@@ fi@@ er of silver , and he will pur@@ ify the sons of L@@ evi , and ref@@ ine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Yah@@ we@@ h offer@@ ings in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and be@@ hold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and wor@@ shi@@ ped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus was re@@ ig@@ ning over Ju@@ de@@ a in the place of his father , Her@@ od , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Gal@@ il@@ ee ,
" even now the ax@@ e lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
his win@@ no@@ wing for@@ k is in his hand , and he will thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly cleans@@ e his th@@ res@@ hing floor . he will gather his wheat into the bar@@ n , but the c@@ haf@@ f he will bur@@ n up with un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire . "
" you are the salt of the ear@@ th , but if the salt has lost its f@@ lav@@ or , with what will it be sal@@ ted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and tro@@ dden under the feet of men .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' W@@ ho@@ ever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your ad@@ versary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
if your right eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , p@@ lu@@ ck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should per@@ ish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
if your right hand causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should per@@ ish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
but I tell you , love your enem@@ ies , b@@ less those who cur@@ se you , do good to those who h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for those who mist@@ re@@ at you and persec@@ ute you ,
" be careful that you don '@@ t do your char@@ itable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the sou@@ l . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both sou@@ l and body in Ge@@ hen@@ na .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
he said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one she@@ ep , and if this one falls into a p@@ it on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , won '@@ t he gra@@ b on to it , and lift it out ?
who@@ ever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be for@@ given him ; but who@@ ever speaks against the Holy Spiri@@ t , it will not be for@@ given him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
for this people 's heart has grown cal@@ l@@ ous , their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , they have closed their eyes ; or else perhaps they might perce@@ ive with their eyes , hear with their e@@ ars , understand with their heart , and should turn again ; and I would he@@ al them . '
let both grow together until the har@@ v@@ est , and in the har@@ v@@ est time I will tell the re@@ apers , " First , gather up the dar@@ nel we@@ eds , and bin@@ d them in bun@@ d@@ les to bur@@ n them ; but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n . " ' "
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into contain@@ ers , but the bad they threw away .
he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tu@@ des to sit down on the gr@@ ass ; and he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed , broke and gave the lo@@ aves to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les gave to the multi@@ tu@@ des .
in the morning , ' It will be f@@ oul weather today , for the sky is red and threatening . ' hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! you know how to dis@@ cer@@ n the appearance of the sky , but you can '@@ t dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times !
as they were coming down from the mountain , J@@ es@@ us comman@@ ded them , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
but who@@ ever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to st@@ um@@ ble , it would be better for him that a huge mil@@ l@@ stone should be hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and that he should be sun@@ k in the dep@@ ths of the sea .
if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred she@@ ep , and one of them goes as@@ tra@@ y , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he leave the n@@ in@@ ety @@@ -@@ @ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone as@@ tra@@ y ?
but because he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
" but that ser@@ vant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred den@@ ar@@ ii , and he gra@@ bbed him , and took him by the thro@@ at , saying , ' P@@ ay me what you o@@ we ! '
for there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were born that way from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s by men ; and there are e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en 's sake . he who is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
" for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to h@@ ire labor@@ ers for his v@@ ine@@ yard .
but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , " You don '@@ t know what you are asking . are you able to drink the c@@ up that I am about to drink , and be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism that I am b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with ? " they said to him , " We are able . "
J@@ es@@ us entered into the temp@@ le of God , and dro@@ ve out all of those who sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the money chan@@ gers ' tables and the seats of those who sold the d@@ ov@@ es .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fa@@ thers , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have been par@@ tak@@ ers with them in the blood of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . '
and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . then all the tri@@ bes of the ear@@ th will mour@@ n , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky with power and great gl@@ ory .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship ,
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the th@@ i@@ ef was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his gl@@ ory , and all the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s with him , then he will sit on the th@@ r@@ one of his gl@@ ory .
then the chief pri@@ ests , the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has .
be@@ hold , one of those who were with J@@ es@@ us stret@@ ched out his hand , and drew his s@@ word , and struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and struck off his e@@ ar .
as they came out , they found a man of Cy@@ ren@@ e , Simon by name , and they comp@@ elled him to go with them , that he might carry his cross .
those who passed by b@@ las@@ phe@@ med him , w@@ ag@@ ging their heads ,
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat men@@ ding the n@@ ets .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the ro@@ of where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the M@@ at that the paral@@ y@@ tic was lying on .
when he had looked around at them with an@@ ger , being gri@@ ev@@ ed at the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts , he said to the man , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand . " he stret@@ ched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perce@@ ive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sin@@ s should be for@@ given them . ' "
because he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been torn apart by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to t@@ ame him .
they came to J@@ es@@ us , and saw him who had been poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legi@@ on ; and they were afraid .
who@@ ever will not receive you nor hear you , as you de@@ part from there , shake off the d@@ ust that is under your feet for a testimony against them . As@@ su@@ red@@ ly , I tell you , it will be more toler@@ able for So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h in the day of judgment than for that city ! "
they don '@@ t eat when they come from the market@@ place , unless they ba@@ the themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : w@@ ash@@ ings of c@@ ups , pit@@ chers , bronze vessels , and cou@@ ches . )
" for you set aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , and hold tigh@@ tly to the tradition of men@@ -@@ -@@ the w@@ ashing of pit@@ chers and c@@ ups , and you do many other such things . "
from there he ar@@ ose , and went away into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on . he entered into a house , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t want anyone to know it , but he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t escape no@@ tice .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he comman@@ ded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for he was teaching his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
for who@@ ever will give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because you are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
if your fo@@ ot causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life la@@ me , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the fire that will never be qu@@ en@@ ch@@ ed@@ --
if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire ,
you know the comman@@ d@@ ments : ' do not murder , ' ' D@@ o not commit ad@@ ul@@ tery , ' ' D@@ o not ste@@ al , ' ' D@@ o not give false testimony , ' ' D@@ o not def@@ ra@@ ud , ' ' hon@@ or your father and mother . ' "
they came to Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ es@@ us entered into the temp@@ le , and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the money chan@@ gers , and the seats of those who sold the d@@ ov@@ es .
for most certainly I tell you , who@@ ever may tell this mountain , ' Be taken up and cast into the sea , ' and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is happening ; he shall have whatever he says .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? " but he , kno@@ wing their hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , said to them , " Wh@@ y do you test me ? bring me a den@@ ar@@ i@@ us , that I may see it . "
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neigh@@ bor as himself , is more important than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . "
when they lead you away and deliver you up , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious be@@ fore@@ hand , or pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spiri@@ t .
but when you see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not ( let the re@@ ader understand ) , then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains ,
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also comman@@ ded the do@@ or@@ keep@@ er to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over and the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might se@@ ize him by dec@@ eption , and kill him .
most certainly I tell you , wher@@ ever this Go@@ od News may be pre@@ ached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high pri@@ est . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
but he again denied it . after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Gal@@ il@@ ean , and your speech shows it . "
he bought a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and taking him down , wo@@ und him in the lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rol@@ led a stone against the door of the tomb .
after@@ ward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he re@@ bu@@ ked them for their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ de@@ a , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the pri@@ est@@ ly division of A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah . he had a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he will drink no wine nor strong drink . he will be filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , even from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
be@@ hold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
it happened on the eighth day , that they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they would have called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of the father .
Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ de@@ a , to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
it happened , when the an@@ gel@@ s went away from them into the sky , that the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , " Let 's go to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , now , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
now in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate being governor of Ju@@ de@@ a , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of the region of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and T@@ rac@@ hon@@ itis , and Ly@@ san@@ ias te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
even now the ax@@ e also lies at the root of the trees . every tree therefore that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the bro@@ w of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the c@@ lif@@ f .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any si@@ ck with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
when it was day , he depar@@ ted and went into an un@@ inhabited place , and the multi@@ tu@@ des looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t go away from them .
now it happened on the second Sab@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he was going through the gra@@ in fields . his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the heads of gra@@ in , and ate , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not law@@ ful to eat except for the pri@@ ests alone ? "
to him who strikes you on the che@@ ek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your clo@@ ak , don '@@ t with@@ hold your co@@ at also .
" give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will be given to you . for with the same measure you measure it will be meas@@ ured back to you . "
the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good , and the ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart brings out that which is ev@@ il , for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart , his m@@ outh speaks .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , be@@ hold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a wi@@ dow . many people of the city were with her .
this is he of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
they are like children who sit in the market@@ place , and call one to another , saying , ' We pip@@ ed to you , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dance . we mour@@ ned , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t we@@ ep . '
that which fell among the thor@@ ns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are ch@@ oked with car@@ es , ri@@ ches , and pleas@@ ures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
now it happened on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his dis@@ cip@@ les , and he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side of the lake . " so they launched out .
when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the el@@ ders , chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for who@@ ever will be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he comes in his gl@@ ory , and the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way tas@@ te of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
for the Son of Man di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
turning to the dis@@ cip@@ les , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my F@@ ather . no one knows who the Son is , except the F@@ ather , and who the F@@ ather is , except the Son , and he to who@@ mev@@ er the Son desi@@ res to reveal him . "
on the next day , when he depar@@ ted , he took out two den@@ ar@@ ii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' T@@ ake care of him . whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '

" which of you fa@@ thers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won '@@ t give him a sn@@ ake instead of a fish , will he ?
the un@@ clean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through d@@ ry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multi@@ tude lifted up her voice , and said to him , " b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ ore you , and the bre@@ asts which nur@@ sed you ! "
the lam@@ p of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is ev@@ il , your body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
meanwhile , when a multi@@ tude of many thousands had gathered together , so much so that they tr@@ amp@@ led on each other , he began to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les first of all , " be@@ w@@ are of the ye@@ ast of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , which is hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
but if this is how God clo@@ th@@ es the gr@@ ass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the ov@@ en , how much more will he clo@@ the you , O you of little faith ?

it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and put in his own gar@@ den . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lo@@ d@@ ged in its branches . "
" he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , when it fl@@ ashes out of the one part under the sky , sh@@ ines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
they ate , they d@@ rank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the hous@@ et@@ op , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .

he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " be@@ hold , we are going up to Jer@@ usalem , and all the things that are written through the pro@@ ph@@ ets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
" it happened when he had come back again , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , that he comman@@ ded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
for I fear@@ ed you , because you are an ex@@ acting man . you take up that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t lay down , and re@@ ap that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t so@@ w . '
then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains . let those who are in the mid@@ st of her de@@ part . let those who are in the country not enter there@@ in .
now when Her@@ od saw J@@ es@@ us , he was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some mir@@ acle done by him .
an ins@@ cri@@ ption was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
he took it down , and wrapped it in a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize him , but he who sent me to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze in water , he said to me , ' On who@@ mev@@ er you will see the Spiri@@ t des@@ cen@@ ding , and remaining on him , the same is he who b@@ ap@@ ti@@ zes in the Holy Spiri@@ t . '
he made a w@@ hip of cor@@ ds , and threw all out of the temp@@ le , both the she@@ ep and the ox@@ en ; and he p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw their tables .
the wind blo@@ ws where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don '@@ t know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spiri@@ t . "
he who believes in him is not jud@@ ged . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe has been jud@@ ged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
when he heard that J@@ es@@ us had come out of Ju@@ de@@ a into Gal@@ il@@ ee , he went to him , and beg@@ ged him that he would come down and he@@ al his son , for he was at the point of death .
" most certainly I tell you , he who he@@ ars my word , and believes him who sent me , has eter@@ nal life , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
" D@@ on '@@ t think that I will accuse you to the F@@ ather . there is one who acc@@ uses you , even Mos@@ es , on whom you have set your hope .
J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desi@@ red .
when therefore they had ro@@ wed about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five or thirty stadi@@ a , they saw J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
on the next day , the multi@@ tude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one in which his dis@@ cip@@ les had embar@@ ked , and that J@@ es@@ us h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t entered with his dis@@ cip@@ les into the boat , but his dis@@ cip@@ les had gone away alone .
this is the will of my F@@ ather who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eter@@ nal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
I am the living bread which came down out of heav@@ en . if anyone e@@ ats of this bread , he will live fore@@ ver . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my f@@ les@@ h . "
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . J@@ es@@ us was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but J@@ es@@ us was hidden , and went out of the temp@@ le , having gone through their mid@@ st , and so passed by .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t enter by the door into the she@@ ep fold , but clim@@ bs up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
he who is a hired hand , and not a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t own the she@@ ep , sees the w@@ ol@@ f coming , leaves the she@@ ep , and fle@@ es . the w@@ ol@@ f sn@@ at@@ ches the she@@ ep , and sc@@ at@@ ters them .
he said these things , and after that , he said to them , " Our friend , Lazar@@ us , has fallen as@@ le@@ ep , but I am going so that I may aw@@ ake him out of sle@@ ep . "
Mary , therefore , took a po@@ und of o@@ in@@ tment of p@@ ure N@@ ard , very pre@@ ci@@ ous , and ano@@ in@@ ted the feet of J@@ es@@ us , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir . the house was filled with the fra@@ gr@@ ance of the o@@ in@@ tment .
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for J@@ es@@ us ' sake only , but that they might see Lazar@@ us also , whom he had raised from the dead .
they took the branches of the pal@@ m trees , and went out to meet him , and cri@@ ed out , " Hos@@ anna ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel ! "
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " Y@@ et a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that d@@ ark@@ ness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t over@@ take you . he who walk@@ s in the d@@ ark@@ ness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know where he is going .
now before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over , J@@ es@@ us , kno@@ wing that his time had come that he would de@@ part from this world to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own who were in the world , he lov@@ ed them to the end .
J@@ es@@ us therefore answ@@ ered , " It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have di@@ pped it . " so when he had di@@ pped the piece of bread , he gave it to Ju@@ das , the son of Simon Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot .
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' W@@ here I am going , you can '@@ t come , ' so now I tell you .
D@@ on '@@ t you believe that I am in the F@@ ather , and the F@@ ather in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the F@@ ather who lives in me does his works .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my F@@ ather .
but the coun@@ sel@@ or , the Holy Spiri@@ t , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he will te@@ ach you all things , and will remin@@ d you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . D@@ on '@@ t let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fear@@ ful .
you heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' if you lov@@ ed me , you would have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , because I said ' I am going to my F@@ ather ; ' for the F@@ ather is greater than I@@ .
if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
no longer do I call you servants , for the ser@@ vant do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what his lor@@ d does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my F@@ ather , I have made known to you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . ' if they persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don '@@ t go away , the coun@@ sel@@ or won '@@ t come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
however when he , the Spiri@@ t of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he he@@ ars , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
therefore J@@ es@@ us perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " D@@ o you inqu@@ ire among yo@@ ur@@ selves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won '@@ t see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
a woman , when she gives birth , has sor@@ row , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remember the an@@ gu@@ ish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you pla@@ in@@ ly about the F@@ ather .
be@@ hold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be sc@@ at@@ tered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy F@@ ather , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
Simon Peter therefore , having a s@@ word , drew it , and struck the high pri@@ est 's ser@@ vant , and cut off his right e@@ ar . the ser@@ vant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other dis@@ cip@@ le , who was known to the high pri@@ est , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of co@@ als , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard these words , he brought J@@ es@@ us out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pav@@ ement , " but in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a . "
therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don '@@ t know where they have laid him ! "
when therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the dis@@ cip@@ les were assemb@@ led , for fear of the Jews , J@@ es@@ us came and stood in the mid@@ st , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
that dis@@ cip@@ le therefore whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed said to Peter , " It 's the Lord ! " so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his co@@ at around him ( for he was nak@@ ed ) , and threw himself into the sea .
but the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts away ) , dra@@ gging the net full of fish .
most certainly I tell you , when you were young , you d@@ ressed yo@@ ur@@ self , and walked where you wanted to . but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will d@@ ress you , and carry you where you don '@@ t want to go . "
there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , which if they would all be written , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have room for the books that would be written .
when they had come in , they went up into the up@@ per room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , An@@ drew , Philip , Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ olome@@ w , Matthew , James the son of Alp@@ ha@@ e@@ us , Simon the Zeal@@ ot , and Ju@@ das the son of James .
therefore , being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up the Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ,
they recogn@@ ized him , that it was he who used to sit beg@@ ging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ autiful G@@ ate of the temp@@ le . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
when they heard it , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , " O Lord , you are God , who made the heav@@ en , the ear@@ th , the sea , and all that is in them ;
when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and they spoke the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
they agreed with him . summon@@ ing the A@@ post@@ les , they beat them and comman@@ ded them not to speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
'@@ i will judge the nation to which they will be in bon@@ da@@ ge , ' said God , ' and after that will they come out , and serve me in this place . '
I have su@@ rely seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
saying to Aaron , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds that will go before us , for as for this Mos@@ es , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
for un@@ clean spir@@ its came out of many of those who had them . they came out , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice . many who had been paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed and la@@ me were he@@ aled .
now while Peter was very per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , be@@ hold , the men who were sent by Cor@@ neli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
send therefore to J@@ op@@ pa , and sum@@ mon Simon , who is sur@@ named Peter . he lo@@ dges in the house of Simon a tan@@ ner , by the seaside . when he comes , he will speak to you . '
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , un@@ settling your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , ' You must be circum@@ c@@ ised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no comman@@ d@@ ment ;
but Paul di@@ d@@ n '@@ t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go with them to do the work .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decre@@ es to them to keep which had been or@@ da@@ ined by the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders who were at Jer@@ usalem .
on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day we went forth outside of the city by a ri@@ versi@@ de , where we supposed there was a place of pray@@ er , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignor@@ ance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to d@@ well on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , having determined appointed se@@ as@@ ons , and the boundaries of their d@@ wel@@ lings ,
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by the man whom he has or@@ da@@ ined ; of which he has given assur@@ ance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jer@@ usalem , but I will return again to you if God Wil@@ ls , " he set sa@@ il from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be able to give an account of this commo@@ tion . "
a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us sat in the window , weighed down with deep sle@@ ep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sle@@ ep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was has@@ tening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jer@@ usalem on the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
when it happened that we had par@@ ted from them and had set sa@@ il , we came with a stra@@ ight course to C@@ os , and the next day to R@@ ho@@ des , and from there to Pat@@ ara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sa@@ iled to Syria , and lan@@ ded at T@@ y@@ re , for there the ship was to un@@ load her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's compan@@ ions , depar@@ ted , and came to Ca@@ es@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
some sh@@ ou@@ ted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t find out the truth because of the no@@ ise , he comman@@ ded him to be brought into the barracks .
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the st@@ airs , bec@@ kon@@ ed with his hand to the people . when there was a great sil@@ ence , he spoke to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w language , saying ,
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when a great argument ar@@ ose , the comman@@ ding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so on the next day , when Agri@@ p@@ pa and Bern@@ ice had come with great pom@@ p , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the comman@@ ding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of F@@ es@@ tus , Paul was brought in .
this I also did in Jer@@ usalem . I both shut up many of the sa@@ ints in prisons , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a ser@@ vant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
embar@@ king in a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , which was about to sa@@ il to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
after they had ho@@ isted it up , they used cab@@ les to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run ag@@ round on the Sy@@ r@@ tis s@@ and bars , they lowered the sea an@@ ch@@ or , and so were driven along .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " Sir@@ s , you should have list@@ ened to me , and not have set sa@@ il from Cre@@ te , and have gotten this injur@@ y and loss .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sa@@ il@@ ors sur@@ mis@@ ed that they were drawing near to some land .
casting off the an@@ ch@@ ors , they left them in the sea , at the same time un@@ t@@ ying the ru@@ d@@ der ro@@ pes . Ho@@ isting up the fore@@ sa@@ il to the wind , they made for the beach .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Ap@@ pi@@ us and The Th@@ ree ta@@ ver@@ ns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guar@@ ded him .
for this people 's heart has grown cal@@ l@@ ous . their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing . their eyes they have closed . L@@ est they should see with their eyes , hear with their e@@ ars , understand with their heart , and would turn again , and I would he@@ al them . '
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , for it is the power of God for sal@@ vation for everyone who believes ; for the J@@ ew first , and also for the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his ever@@ lasting power and di@@ vin@@ ity ; that they may be without exc@@ use .
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every m@@ outh may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he received the sign of circum@@ c@@ ision , a se@@ al of the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the faith which he had while he was in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they might be in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness might also be accounted to them .
without being weak@@ ened in faith , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ ah 's w@@ om@@ b .
kno@@ wing this , that our old man was cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bon@@ da@@ ge to sin .
or don '@@ t you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has domin@@ ion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for I know that in me , that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , d@@ wel@@ ls no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don '@@ t find it doing that which is good .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to those who are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who don '@@ t walk according to the f@@ les@@ h , but according to the Spiri@@ t .
for those who live according to the f@@ les@@ h set their min@@ ds on the things of the f@@ les@@ h , but those who live according to the Spiri@@ t , the things of the Spiri@@ t .
but you are not in the f@@ les@@ h but in the Spiri@@ t , if it is so that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ wel@@ ls in you . but if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is not his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him who raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ wel@@ ls in you , he who raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us from the dead will also give life to your mort@@ al bodies through his Spiri@@ t who d@@ wel@@ ls in you .
for if you live after the f@@ les@@ h , you must die ; but if by the Spiri@@ t you put to death the de@@ eds of the body , you will live .
who is he who condem@@ ns ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist who died , yes rather , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who also makes inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
for the S@@ crip@@ ture says to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the ear@@ th . "
as he says also in Hos@@ ea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' bel@@ ov@@ ed , ' who was not bel@@ ov@@ ed . "
and how will they pre@@ ach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News of peace , who bring glad ti@@ dings of good things ! "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were graf@@ ted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be graf@@ ted into their own olive tree ?
be of the same mind one toward another . D@@ on '@@ t set your mind on high things , but associate with the hum@@ ble . D@@ on '@@ t be wise in your own conce@@ its .
therefore " If your enemy is hun@@ gry , fe@@ ed him . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head . "
for rul@@ ers are not a terror to the good work , but to the ev@@ il . do you desire to have no fear of the authority ? do that which is good , and you will have praise from the same ,
he who obser@@ ves the day , obser@@ ves it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who e@@ ats , e@@ ats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , to the Lord he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , and gives God thanks .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the ful@@ l@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way wor@@ thy of the sa@@ ints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she her@@ self also has been a hel@@ per of many , and of my own self .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence has become known to all . I re@@ jo@@ ice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is ev@@ il .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perf@@ ected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Ch@@ lo@@ e 's household , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for seeing that in the wis@@ dom of God , the world through its wis@@ dom di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know God , it was God 's good pleas@@ ure through the fo@@ ol@@ ishness of the pre@@ aching to save those who believe .
but God chose the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world that he might put to sh@@ ame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to sh@@ ame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the low@@ ly things of the world , and the things that are desp@@ ised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spiri@@ t .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spiri@@ t which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you bo@@ ast as if you had not received it ?
such were some of you , but you were was@@ hed . but you were sanc@@ ti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and in the Spiri@@ t of our God .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that your bodies are members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them members of a pro@@ stitute ? May it never be !
D@@ on '@@ t de@@ pri@@ ve one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er , and may be together again , that S@@ atan do@@ es@@ n '@@ t temp@@ t you because of your lack of self @@@ -@@ @ control .
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconc@@ iled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the dist@@ ress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
but food will not commen@@ d us to God . for neither , if we don '@@ t eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a v@@ ine@@ yard , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat of its fruit ? or who fe@@ eds a flock , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t drink from the flock 's milk ?
D@@ on '@@ t you know that those who serve around sac@@ red things eat from the things of the temp@@ le , and those who wait on the alt@@ ar have their portion with the alt@@ ar ?
what then is my reward ? that , when I pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , I may present the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Go@@ od News .
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
you can '@@ t both drink the c@@ up of the Lord and the c@@ up of dem@@ ons . you can '@@ t both par@@ take of the table of the Lord , and of the table of dem@@ ons .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to id@@ ols , " don '@@ t eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of con@@ science . for " the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and all its ful@@ l@@ ness . "
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and gl@@ ory of God , but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
love never fails . but where there are pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will ce@@ ase . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y . for he is greater who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interpre@@ ts , that the assembly may be built up .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
if any man thinks himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him recogn@@ ize the things which I write to you , that they are the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us through the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints who are in the whole of A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ ts us in all our aff@@ li@@ ction , that we may be able to comfor@@ t those who are in any aff@@ li@@ ction , through the comfor@@ t with which we ourselves are comfor@@ ted by God .
for our bo@@ asting is this : the testimony of our con@@ science , that in hol@@ iness and sinc@@ erity of God , not in fle@@ sh@@ ly wis@@ dom but in the grace of God we beha@@ ved ourselves in the world , and more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly toward you .
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
for out of much aff@@ li@@ ction and an@@ gu@@ ish of heart I wrote to you with many te@@ ars , not that you should be made sor@@ ry , but that you might know the love that I have so ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly for you .
so that on the contrary you should rather for@@ give him and comfor@@ t him , lest by any means such a one should be sw@@ allowed up with his excessive sor@@ row .
being revealed that you are a letter of Ch@@ r@@ ist , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tab@@ lets of stone , but in tab@@ lets that are hear@@ ts of f@@ les@@ h .
and not as Mos@@ es , who put a ve@@ il on his face , that the children of Israel wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t look stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly on the end of that which was passing away .
but we have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of sh@@ ame , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by the manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
in whom the go@@ d of this world has b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of the un@@ believ@@ ing , that the light of the Go@@ od News of the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should not da@@ wn on them .
while we don '@@ t look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al , but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for we are not commen@@ ding ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of bo@@ asting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who bo@@ ast in appearance , and not in heart .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I list@@ ened to you , in a day of sal@@ vation I helped you . " be@@ hold , now is the acceptable time . be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation .
so although I wrote to you , I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered the wrong , but that your ear@@ n@@ est care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God .
for if in anything I have bo@@ asted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our g@@ lor@@ ying also which I made before Tit@@ us was found to be truth .
but I have sent the brothers that our bo@@ asting on your behalf may not be in v@@ ain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they g@@ lor@@ ify God for the obe@@ di@@ ence of your conf@@ ession to the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and for the liber@@ ality of your contribution to them and to all ;
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone tru@@ sts in himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , so also we are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they bo@@ ast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if he dev@@ ours you , if he takes you cap@@ tive , if he ex@@ al@@ ts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for if I would desire to bo@@ ast , I will not be fo@@ ol@@ ish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or he@@ ars from me .
by reason of the exceeding gre@@ at@@ ness of the reve@@ lations , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , a mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to tor@@ ment me , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively .
for what is there in which you were made in@@ fer@@ ior to the rest of the assemb@@ lies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don '@@ t you know as to your own selves , that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you ? -@@ -@@ unless indeed you are dis@@ qualified .
but from those who were re@@ pu@@ ted to be important ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t show parti@@ ality to man ) -@@ -@@ they , I say , who were respected im@@ par@@ ted nothing to me ,
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a cur@@ se . for it is written , " Cur@@ sed is everyone who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law , to do them . "
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
to an administration of the ful@@ l@@ ness of the times , to sum up all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the things in the heav@@ ens , and the things on the ear@@ th , in him ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Go@@ od News of your sal@@ v@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Ch@@ r@@ ist , ali@@ en@@ ated from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
of which I was made a ser@@ vant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
until we all at@@ tain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stat@@ ure of the ful@@ l@@ ness of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
from whom all the body , being f@@ it@@ ted and k@@ n@@ it together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
being dar@@ ken@@ ed in their understanding , ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God , because of the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts ;
for our wrestling is not against f@@ les@@ h and blood , but against the princip@@ alities , against the powers , against the world 's rul@@ ers of the d@@ ark@@ ness of this age , and against the spir@@ itual forces of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the heav@@ en@@ ly places .
but if I live on in the f@@ les@@ h , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don '@@ t know what I will choose .
not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect ; but I press on , if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
nevertheless , to the extent that we have already at@@ tained , let us walk by the same rule . let us be of the same mind .
who will change the body of our hum@@ iliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his gl@@ ory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are hon@@ or@@ able , whatever things are just , whatever things are p@@ ure , whatever things are lov@@ ely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don '@@ t ce@@ ase pray@@ ing and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spir@@ itual wis@@ dom and understanding ,
now I re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
in whom you were also circum@@ c@@ ised with a circum@@ c@@ ision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h , in the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
and that our Go@@ od News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spiri@@ t , and with much assur@@ ance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
and that you make it your ambi@@ tion to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instruc@@ ted you ;
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way prece@@ de those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother who walk@@ s in rebel@@ lion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in la@@ bor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
( but if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruc@@ t the brothers of these things , you will be a good ser@@ vant of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , no@@ ur@@ ished in the words of the faith , and of the good doc@@ tr@@ ine which you have followed .
let no man desp@@ ise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in p@@ urity .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gen@@ ti@@ les might hear ; and I was delivered out of the m@@ outh of the lion .
you have put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " for in that he subj@@ ected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don '@@ t see all things subj@@ ected to him , yet .
therefore he was oblig@@ ated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a mer@@ ci@@ ful and fa@@ ith@@ ful high pri@@ est in things per@@ taining to God , to make At@@ on@@ ement for the sin@@ s of the people .
for indeed we have had good news pre@@ ached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard di@@ d@@ n '@@ t profit them , because it was@@ n '@@ t mixed with faith by those who heard .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I s@@ wor@@ e in my wr@@ ath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
for we don '@@ t have a high pri@@ est who can '@@ t be touched with the feeling of our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities , but one who has been in all points temp@@ ted like we are , yet without sin .
for the land which has dr@@ un@@ k the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a cro@@ p su@@ itable for them for whose sake it is also til@@ led , receives b@@ les@@ sing from God ;
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous , so as to forget your work and the la@@ bor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the sa@@ ints , and still do serve them .
they indeed of the sons of L@@ evi who receive the pri@@ est 's office have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Ab@@ ra@@ ham ,
( for they indeed have been made pri@@ ests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord s@@ wor@@ e and will not change his mind , ' You are a pri@@ est fore@@ ver , according to the order of Mel@@ chi@@ zede@@ k . ' "
" for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
they will not te@@ ach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' K@@ now the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
having a golden alt@@ ar of incen@@ se , and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant over@@ laid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden po@@ t holding the man@@ na , Aaron 's ro@@ d that bud@@ ded , and the tab@@ lets of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
for when every comman@@ d@@ ment had been spoken by Mos@@ es to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the cal@@ ves and the go@@ ats , with water and scar@@ let wo@@ ol and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led both the book itself and all the people ,
" this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
by faith , we understand that the uni@@ verse has been fra@@ med by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well ple@@ asing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called , obe@@ yed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance . he went out , not kno@@ wing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an ali@@ en in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , d@@ wel@@ ling in ten@@ ts , with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multi@@ tude , and as in@@ num@@ er@@ able as the s@@ and which is by the sea shore , were fa@@ ther@@ ed by one man , and him as good as dead .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
looking to J@@ es@@ us , the author and perf@@ ec@@ ter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising its sh@@ ame , and has sat down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
D@@ on '@@ t be carried away by various and st@@ range teach@@ ings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benef@@ ited .
and the ton@@ gue is a fire . the world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity among our members is the ton@@ gue , which def@@ il@@ es the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Ge@@ hen@@ na .
D@@ on '@@ t speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
be@@ hold , the wages of the labor@@ ers who mo@@ wed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cri@@ es of those who re@@ ap@@ ed have entered into the e@@ ars of the Lord of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . be@@ hold , the far@@ mer waits for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fruit of the ear@@ th , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
but you are a chosen race , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , a hol@@ y nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may procla@@ im the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of him who called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous light :
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with hum@@ il@@ ity and fear :
for to this end the Go@@ od News was pre@@ ached even to the dead , that they might be jud@@ ged indeed as men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live as to God in the spirit .
if you are ins@@ ulted for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , you are b@@ les@@ sed ; because the Spiri@@ t of gl@@ ory and of God rests on you . on their part he is b@@ las@@ phe@@ med , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
for we did not follow c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but we were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
for if , after they have escaped the def@@ il@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ ior J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heav@@ ens that now are , and the ear@@ th , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of un@@ go@@ dly men .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Wor@@ d of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eter@@ nal life , which was with the F@@ ather , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us . yes , and our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fel@@ low@@ ship with one another , and the blood of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , his Son , cleans@@ es us from all sin .
I write to you , fa@@ thers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the ev@@ il one . I write to you , little children , because you know the F@@ ather .
I have written to you , fa@@ thers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the ev@@ il one .
D@@ on '@@ t love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone lov@@ es the world , the F@@ ather 's love is@@ n '@@ t in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the F@@ ather 's , but is the world 's .
they went out from us , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the dev@@ il . who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother .
and every spirit who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t conf@@ ess that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist has come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
we are of God . he who knows God list@@ ens to us . he who is not of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of er@@ ror .
if a man says , " I love God , " and ha@@ tes his brother , he is a li@@ ar ; for he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eter@@ nal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us an understanding , that we know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist . this is the true God , and eter@@ nal life .
having many things to write to you , I don '@@ t want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
remember therefore from where you have fallen , and rep@@ ent and do the first works ; or else I am coming to you swi@@ f@@ tly , and will move your lam@@ p@@ stand out of its place , unless you rep@@ ent .
he who has an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t says to the assemb@@ lies . to him who over@@ comes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Par@@ ad@@ ise of my God .
" I know your works , op@@ pression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass , says these things :
" and to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Sar@@ dis write : " he who has the seven spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars says these things : " I know your works , that you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
he who over@@ comes will be ar@@ ray@@ ed in white gar@@ ments , and I will in no way blo@@ t his name out of the book of life , and I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write : " he who is hol@@ y , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who sh@@ u@@ ts and no one opens , says these things :
" I know your works ( be@@ hold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t deny my name .
be@@ hold , I give of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed you .
because you kept my command to en@@ dur@@ e , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
because you say , ' I am rich , and have gotten ri@@ ches , and have need of nothing ; ' and don '@@ t know that you are the w@@ ret@@ ched one , mis@@ er@@ able , poor , b@@ lin@@ d , and nak@@ ed ;
I saw in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four living cre@@ atures , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , a lam@@ b standing , as though it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God , sent out into all the ear@@ th .
now when he had taken the book , the four living cre@@ atures and the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four el@@ ders fell down before the lam@@ b , each one having a har@@ p , and golden bo@@ w@@ ls full of incen@@ se , which are the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many an@@ gel@@ s around the th@@ r@@ one , the living cre@@ atures , and the el@@ ders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
when he opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under@@ ne@@ ath the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of those who had been killed for the Wor@@ d of God , and for the testimony of the lam@@ b which they had .
a long white ro@@ be was given to each of them . they were told that they should rest yet for a while , until their fellow servants and their brothers , who would also be killed even as they were , should complete their course .
the kings of the ear@@ th , the pr@@ inces , the comman@@ ding officers , the rich , the strong , and every sla@@ ve and free person , hi@@ d themselves in the c@@ aves and in the ro@@ cks of the mountains .
after this , I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing at the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , so that no wind would blow on the ear@@ th , or on the sea , or on any tree .
the first so@@ unded , and there followed ha@@ il and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the ear@@ th . one third of the ear@@ th was bur@@ n@@ t up , and one third of the trees were bur@@ n@@ t up , and all green gr@@ ass was bur@@ n@@ t up .
he opened the p@@ it of the ab@@ y@@ ss , and smoke went up out of the p@@ it , like the smoke from a burning fur@@ n@@ ace . the sun and the air were dar@@ ken@@ ed because of the smoke from the p@@ it .
thus I saw the hor@@ ses in the vision , and those who sat on them , having bre@@ ast@@ plates of fi@@ ery red , hy@@ ac@@ inth blue , and sul@@ f@@ ur yel@@ low ; and the heads of li@@ ons . out of their m@@ ou@@ ths proceed fire , smoke , and sul@@ f@@ ur .
for the power of the hor@@ ses is in their m@@ ou@@ ths , and in their ta@@ ils . for their ta@@ ils are like Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and have heads , and with them they harm .
the voice which I heard from heav@@ en , again speaking with me , said , " G@@ o , take the book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh . when I had e@@ aten it , my st@@ om@@ ach was made bitter .
leave out the court which is outside of the temp@@ le , and don '@@ t measure it , for it has been given to the nations . they will tre@@ ad the hol@@ y city under fo@@ ot for for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two months .
from among the peoples , tri@@ bes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
his ta@@ il drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the ear@@ th . the dra@@ g@@ on stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might dev@@ our her child .
the great dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , he who is called the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , the dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were thrown down with him .
two w@@ ings of the great e@@ ag@@ le were given to the woman , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to her place , so that she might be no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
then I stood on the s@@ and of the sea . I saw a be@@ ast coming up out of the sea , having ten hor@@ ns and seven heads . on his hor@@ ns were ten crow@@ ns , and on his heads , b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ous names .
the be@@ ast which I saw was like a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his m@@ outh like the m@@ outh of a lion . the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , his th@@ r@@ one , and great authority .
all who d@@ well on the ear@@ th will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lam@@ b who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the s@@ word , he must be killed . here is the en@@ dur@@ ance and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
it was given to him to give bre@@ ath to it , to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause as many as wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the be@@ ast to be killed .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the sla@@ ve , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their fore@@ heads ;
I saw , and be@@ hold , the lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his F@@ ather , written on their fore@@ heads .
the smoke of their tor@@ ment goes up fore@@ ver and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and who@@ ever receives the mark of his name .
another an@@ gel came out from the temp@@ le , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice to him who sat on the cl@@ oud , " S@@ end forth your si@@ ck@@ le , and re@@ ap ; for the hour to re@@ ap has come ; for the har@@ v@@ est of the ear@@ th is ri@@ pe ! "
the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temp@@ le , until the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s would be finished .
the first went , and p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the ear@@ th , and it became a harmful and ev@@ il sor@@ e on the people who had the mark of the be@@ ast , and who wor@@ shi@@ ped his image .
the sixth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the great river , the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates . its water was dri@@ ed up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sun@@ rise .
I saw coming out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t , three un@@ clean spir@@ its , something like fro@@ gs ;
for they are spir@@ its of dem@@ ons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited ear@@ th , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Bab@@ yl@@ on the great was remember@@ ed in the sight of God , to give to her the c@@ up of the wine of the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath .
and on her fore@@ head a name was written , " my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of the pro@@ stitu@@ tes and of the AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth . "
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
for God has put in their hear@@ ts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their k@@ ing@@ dom to the be@@ ast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th grew rich from the ab@@ und@@ ance of her luxury . "
the light of a lam@@ p will sh@@ ine no more at all in you . the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de will be heard no more at all in you ; for your mer@@ chan@@ ts were the pr@@ inces of the ear@@ th ; for with your sor@@ cer@@ y all the nations were dec@@ e@@ ived .
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments . for he has jud@@ ged the great pro@@ stitute , who cor@@ rupted the ear@@ th with her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and he has av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us re@@ jo@@ ice and be exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , and let us give the gl@@ ory to him . for the marriage of the lam@@ b has come , and his wife has made her@@ self ready . "
it was given to her that she would array her@@ self in bright , p@@ ure , fine lin@@ en : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the sa@@ ints .
and he will come out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the th@@ r@@ one , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were jud@@ ged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fru@@ its , yi@@ el@@ ding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the he@@ aling of the nations .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel who had shown me these things .
he who acts un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , let him act un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly still . he who is fil@@ thy , let him be fil@@ thy still . he who is righ@@ te@@ ous , let him do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness still . he who is hol@@ y , let him be hol@@ y still . "
