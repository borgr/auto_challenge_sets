Karl Marx ( ; ; 5 May 1818 - 14 March 1883 ) was a German philosopher , economist , sociologist , journalist , and revolutionary socialist .
He moved to Paris in 1843 , where he began writing for other radical newspapers and met Friedrich Engels , who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator .
In 1849 he was exiled and moved to London together with his wife and children , where he continued writing and formulating his theories about social and economic activity .
In 1815 Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney , in 1819 moving his family to a ten @-@ room property near the Porta Nigra .
She was from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics : she was great @-@ aunt to Anton and Gerard Philips , and great @-@ great @-@ aunt to Frits Philips .
The third of nine children , he became the oldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819 .
Young Karl was baptised into the Lutheran Church in August 1824 .
His surviving siblings , Sophie , Hermann , Henriette , Louise , Emilie and Karoline , were also baptised as Lutherans .
By employing many liberal humanists as teachers , Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government .
Subsequently , police raided the school in 1832 , and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students .
In October 1835 at the age of 17 , Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature : however , his father insisted on law as a more practical field .
While at the University at Bonn , Marx joined the Poets ' Club , a group containing political radicals that was being monitored by the police .
Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society ( " Landsmannschaft der Treveraner " ) , at one point serving as club co @-@ president .
Although his grades in the first term were good , they soon deteriorated , leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic University of Berlin .
= = = Hegelianism and early activism : 1836 @-@ 1843 = = = Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier , Marx became more serious about his studies and his life .
In October 1836 he arrived in Berlin , matriculating in the university 's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse .
Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel , whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles .
Marx had been emotionally close to his father , and treasured his memory after his death .
He began co @-@ operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel 's " Philosophy of Religion " in 1840 .
Marx decided , instead , to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena , whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841 .
In July , Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin .
There they scandalised their class by getting drunk , laughing in church , and galloping through the streets on donkeys .
Marx was considering an academic career , but this path was barred by the government 's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians .
He criticised both right @-@ wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter @-@ productive .
Seven years after their engagement , on 19 June 1843 Marx married Jenny in a Protestant church in Kreuznach .
Based in Paris , France , it was here that Marx and his wife moved in October 1843 .
Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau , they found the living conditions difficult , so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844 .
Based in Paris , the paper was connected to the League of the Just , a utopian socialist secret society of workers and artisans .
On 28 August 1844 , Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence , beginning a lifelong friendship .
Soon Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx 's former friend , Bruno Bauer .
Although critical of Bauer , Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach , but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well .
During the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris ( from October 1843 until January 1845 ) , Marx engaged in an intensive study of " political economy " ( Adam Smith , David Ricardo , James Mill " etc .
" ) , the French socialists ( especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier ) and the history of France .
Marx sought " to understand the inner workings of capitalism .
= = = Brussels : 1845 @-@ 1847 = = = Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany , Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845 .
This was Marx 's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip .
Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester , from November 1842 to August 1844 .
Indeed , Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers .
Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester .
In this work , Marx broke with Feuerbach , Bruno Bauer , Max Stirner and the rest of the Young Hegelians , and also broke with Karl Grun and other " true socialists " whose philosophies were still based in part on " idealism .
This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx 's own scientific socialist philosophy .
This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning .
This new open political society was called the Communist League .
Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League .
In late 1847 , Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work - a programme of action for the Communist League .
Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848 , " The Communist Manifesto " was first published on 21 February 1848 .
" The Communist Manifesto " laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League .
Later that year , Europe experienced a series of protests , rebellions , and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolution of 1848 .
On 1 June , Marx started publication of a daily newspaper , the " Neue Rheinische Zeitung , " which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father .
Consequently , the " Neue Rheinische Zeitung " was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May .
The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London .
However , in the winter of 1849 @-@ 1850 , a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising .
Such an uprising , as that recommended by the Schapper / Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe .
" Instead , they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development .
In other words , the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution .
After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League , Marx 's opinion prevailed and , eventually , the Willich / Schapper group left the Communist League .
Meanwhile , Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers ' Educational Society .
For the first few years he and his family lived in extreme poverty .
Later Marx and Engels both began writing for six different newspapers around the world , in England , the United States , Prussia , Austria and South Africa .
Thus , Marx sought to communicate with the public by writing articles for the " New York Tribune " and other bourgeois newspapers .
At first Wilhelm Pieper translated Marx 's articles from German into English .
The " New York Daily Tribune " had been founded in New York City in the United States of America by Horace Greeley in April 1841 .
Several things about the " Tribune " made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx to reach a sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean .
Marx 's first article for the " New York Tribune " was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the " Tribune " on 21 August 1852 .
Marx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the " New York Tribune " employed .
However , with the slavery crisis coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 , the American public 's interest in European affairs declined .
Thus Marx very early began to write on issues affecting the United States - particularly the " slavery crisis " and the " War Between the States .
However , the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy .
The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels .
They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained .
As time passed , they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn .
The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revolutionary situation in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries .
The downturn in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur .
He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy .
This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London .
However , in the same letter to Vera Zasulich , Marx points out that " at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production .
Before he died , Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas , which were published in 1884 under the title " The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State . "
There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son , Freddy , out of wedlock by his housekeeper , Helene Demuth .
Marx frequently used pseudonyms , often when renting a house or flat , apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down .
Engels ' speech included the passage : Marx 's daughters Eleanor and Laura , as well as Charles Longuet and Paul Lafargue , Marx 's two French socialist sons @-@ in @-@ law , were also in attendance .
Liebknecht , a founder and leader of the German Social @-@ Democratic Party , gave a speech in German , and Longuet , a prominent figure in the French working @-@ class movement , made a short statement in French .
Two telegrams from workers ' parties in France and Spain were also read out .
Another attendee of the funeral was Ray Lankester , a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic .
After the political events of 31 March 1909 , Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı , who were in Edirne , came to Istanbul with the Movement Army .
In the Istanbul League season prior to the National League 's first season , Beşiktaş finished in 4th place , which earned them a berth in the National League .
Three players of the squad ; Metin Tekin , Ali Gültiken , and Feyyaz Uçar were notable for significant contributions to the team during this period .
The comparison resonated with the team and the fans , and so it was adopted by the Beşiktaş community as their team 's nickname .

A change to the DNA in a gene can alter a protein 's amino acid sequence , thereby changing its shape and function and rendering the protein ineffective or even malignant ( e.g.
Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance works , it was still not known how DNA influences the behavior of cells .
Many species , including humans , have this pattern of inheritance .
These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as Mendel 's first law or the Law of Segregation .
A gene is represented by one or a few letters .
= = = Multiple gene interactions = = = Organisms have thousands of genes , and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other .
This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers .
When a plant has two copies of this white allele , its flowers are white - regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles .
These complex traits are products of many genes .
The influence of these genes is mediated , to varying degrees , by the environment an organism has experienced .
= = Molecular basis for inheritance = = = = = DNA and chromosomes = = = The molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .
DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides , of which there are four types : adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) .
Viruses are the only exception to this rule - sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material .
DNA normally exists as a double @-@ stranded molecule , coiled into the shape of a double helix .
These DNA strands are often extremely long ; the largest human chromosome , for example , is about 247 million base pairs in length .
The full set of hereditary material in an organism ( usually the combined DNA sequences of all chromosomes ) is called the genome .
Some bacteria can undergo conjugation , transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium .
For genes that are closer together , however , the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic linkage ; alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together .
Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains , each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids , and the DNA sequence of a gene ( through an RNA intermediate ) is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence .
This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene 's DNA sequence , a process called transcription .
Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules , sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules ( without changing the structure of the protein itself ) .
Protein structure is dynamic ; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture , transport , and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood .
A single nucleotide difference within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein .
In some cases , these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions ( e.g.
RNA can also have regulatory effect through hybridization interactions with other RNA molecules ( e.g.
The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment .
= = = Gene regulation = = = The genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes , but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment .
The presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes - tryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan repressor ( a transcription factor ) , changing the repressor 's structure such that the repressor binds to the genes .
Differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular organisms , where cells all contain the same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes .
All the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell , differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and intercellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors .
As no single gene is responsible for the development of structures within multicellular organisms , these patterns arise from the complex interactions between many cells .
Because of epigenetic features , different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties .
These errors , called mutations , can have an impact on the phenotype of an organism , especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene .
Over many generations , the genomes of organisms can change significantly , resulting in evolution .
= = = Model organisms = = = Although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms , researchers began to specialize in studying the genetics of a particular subset of organisms .
Common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of gene regulation and the involvement of genes in development and cancer .
When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease , researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease .
The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events .
) DNA can also be amplified using a procedure called the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .
By using specific short sequences of DNA , PCR can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of DNA .
Because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of DNA , PCR is also often used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences .
= = = DNA sequencing and genomics = = = DNA sequencing , one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics , allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA fragments .
Using this technology , researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases .
These technologies were used to sequence the human genome in the Human Genome Project completed in 2003 .

The atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96 % carbon dioxide , 1.93 % argon and 1.89 % nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water .
The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat , the low atmospheric pressure , and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil .
Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north , and near aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north .
As a result , the seasons in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case .
The solar day ( or sol ) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day : 24 hours , 39 minutes , and 35.244 seconds .

Pneumonia ( nu @-@ mo 'ne @-@ a ) is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli .
It is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly other microorganisms , certain drugs and other conditions such as autoimmune diseases .
Diagnostic tools include x @-@ rays and culture of the sputum .
Pneumonia presumed to be bacterial is treated with antibiotics .
If the pneumonia is severe , the affected person is generally hospitalized .
Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally per year , seven percent of population , and results in about 4 million deaths , mostly in developing countries .
Nevertheless , in developing countries , and among the very old , the very young , and the chronically ill , pneumonia remains a leading cause of death .
In the elderly , confusion may be the most prominent sign .
The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever , cough , and fast or difficult breathing .
Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms .
Some causes are associated with classic , but non @-@ specific , clinical characteristics .
Bloody sputum ( known as hemoptysis ) may also occur with tuberculosis , Gram @-@ negative pneumonia , and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with acute bronchitis .
Conditions and risk factors that predispose to pneumonia include smoking , immunodeficiency , alcoholism , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic kidney disease , and liver disease .
= = = Bacteria = = = Bacteria are the most common cause of community @-@ acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , with " Streptococcus pneumoniae " isolated in nearly 50 % of cases .
A number of drug @-@ resistant versions of the above infections are becoming more common , including drug @-@ resistant " Streptococcus pneumoniae " ( DRSP ) and methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) .
Alcoholism is associated with " Streptococcus pneumoniae , " anaerobic organisms , and " Mycobacterium tuberculosis " ; smoking facilitates the effects of " Streptococcus pneumoniae , " " Haemophilus influenzae , " " Moraxella catarrhalis , " and " Legionella pneumophila . "
= = = Viruses = = = In adults , viruses account for approximately a third and in children for about 15 % of pneumonia cases .
Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses , coronaviruses , influenza virus , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , adenovirus , and parainfluenza .
Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia , except in groups such as : newborns , persons with cancer , transplant recipients , and people with significant burns .
Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria " Streptococcus pneumoniae , " " Staphylococcus aureus , " or " Haemophilus influenzae , " particularly when other health problems are present .
It is most often caused by " Histoplasma capsulatum , " blastomyces , " Cryptococcus neoformans , " " Pneumocystis jiroveci , " and " Coccidioides immitis . "
Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin , and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States .
The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population .
= = = Parasites = = = A variety of parasites can affect the lungs , including " Toxoplasma gondii , " " Strongyloides stercoralis , " " Ascaris lumbricoides , " and " Plasmodium malariae . "
These organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin , ingestion , or via an insect vector .
In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants .
Around the world , these infections are most common in the immunodeficient .
= = = Viral = = = Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes .
Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose .
Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood .
When the immune system responds to the infection , even more lung damage may occur .
As well as damaging the lungs , many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions .
Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections ; in this way , bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co @-@ morbid condition .
Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep .
While the throat always contains bacteria , potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions .
Bacteria can spread also via the blood .
This leads to the fever , chills , and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia .
The World Health Organization has defined pneumonia in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate , chest indrawing , or a decreased level of consciousness .
Thus , treatment is frequently based on the presence of influenza in the community or a rapid influenza test .
Examination of the chest may be normal , but it may show decreased chest expansion on the affected side .
In people with mild disease , imaging is needed only in those with potential complications , those not having improved with treatment , or those in which the cause is uncertain .
Findings do not always match the severity of disease and do not reliably separate between bacterial infection and viral infection .
X @-@ ray presentations of pneumonia may be classified as lobar pneumonia , bronchopneumonia ( also known as lobular pneumonia ) , and interstitial pneumonia .
Bacterial , community @-@ acquired pneumonia classically show lung consolidation of one lung segmental lobe , which is known as lobar pneumonia .
Radiographs of viral pneumonia may appear normal , appear hyper @-@ inflated , have bilateral patchy areas , or present similar to bacterial pneumonia with lobar consolidation .
Radiologic findings may not be present in the early stages of the disease , especially in the presence of dehydration , or may be difficult to be interpreted in the obese or those with a history of lung disease .
Testing for other specific organisms may be recommended during outbreaks , for public health reasons .
Viral infections can be confirmed via detection of either the virus or its antigens with culture or polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , among other techniques .
= = = Differential diagnosis = = = Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia , such as : chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma , pulmonary edema , bronchiectasis , lung cancer , and pulmonary emboli .
= = = Vaccination = = = Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults .
Vaccinations against " Haemophilus influenzae " and " Streptococcus pneumoniae " have good evidence to support their use .
Vaccinating children against " Streptococcus pneumoniae " has led to a decreased incidence of these infections in adults , because many adults acquire infections from children .
A " Streptococcus pneumoniae " vaccine is available for adults , and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease .
Other vaccines for which there to support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis , varicella , and measles .
Appropriately treating underlying illnesses ( such as HIV / AIDS , diabetes mellitus , and malnutrition ) can decrease the risk of pneumonia .
= = Management = = Oral antibiotics , rest , simple analgesics , and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution .
However , those with other medical conditions , the elderly , or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care .
Antibiotic choice depends initially on the characteristics of the person affected , such as age , underlying health , and the location the infection was acquired .
The duration of treatment has traditionally been seven to ten days , but increasing evidence suggests that shorter courses ( three to five days ) are similarly effective .
= = = Viral = = = Neuraminidase inhibitors may be used to treat viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses ( influenza A and influenza B ) .
No specific antiviral medications are recommended for other types of community acquired viral pneumonias including SARS coronavirus , adenovirus , hantavirus , and parainfluenza virus .
Many strains of H5N1 influenza A , also known as avian influenza or " bird flu , " have shown resistance to rimantadine and amantadine .
The choice of antibiotic will depend on several factors , including the suspected causative organism and whether pneumonia was acquired in the community or developed in a hospital setting .
In the elderly or people with other lung problems , recovery may take more than 12 weeks .
Pneumonia is the most common hospital @-@ acquired infection that causes death .
These rules are often used in deciding whether or not to hospitalize the person .
In severe cases of empyema , surgery may be needed .
= = = Respiratory and circulatory failure = = = Pneumonia can cause respiratory failure by triggering acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , which results from a combination of infection and inflammatory response .
-- > The organisms most commonly involved are " Streptococcus pneumoniae , " " Haemophilus influenzae , " and " Klebsiella pneumoniae . "
Pneumonia is a common illness affecting approximately 450 million people a year and occurring in all parts of the world .
Rates are greatest in children less than five , and adults older than 75 years .
It occurs about five times more frequently in the developing world than in the developed world .
Viral pneumonia accounts for about 200 million cases .
In the United States , as of 2009 , pneumonia is the 8th leading cause of death .
= = = Children = = = In 2008 , pneumonia occurred in approximately 156 million children ( 151 million in the developing world and 5 million in the developed world ) .
Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India ( 43 million ) , China ( 21 million ) and Pakistan ( 10 million ) .
It is the leading cause of death among children in low income countries .
Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period .
The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia .
Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented , as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available .
= = History = = Pneumonia has been a common disease throughout human history .
" This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks , and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the Middle Ages into the 19th century .
Edwin Klebs was the first to observe bacteria in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875 .
Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes , " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and " Klebsiella pneumoniae , " was performed by Carl Friedländer and Albert Fränkel in 1882 and 1884 , respectively .
This phrase was originally coined by John Bunyan in reference to " consumption " ( tuberculosis ) .
Vaccination against " Streptococcus pneumoniae " in adults began in 1977 , and in children in 2000 , resulting in a similar decline .

Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps , the Swiss Plateau and the Jura , spanning an area of .
The country has a long history of armed neutrality - it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815 - and did not join the United Nations until 2002 .
Nevertheless it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace @-@ building processes around the world .
In addition to being the birthplace of the Red Cross , Switzerland is home to numerous international organizations , including the second largest UN office .
On the European level , it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association and is part of the Schengen Area - although it is notably not a member of the European Union , nor the European Economic Area ( and thus does not use the Euro currency ) .

The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures , named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel .
One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii .
By 1200 , the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy , Zähringer , Habsburg , and Kyburg .
Some regions ( Uri , Schwyz , Unterwalden , later known as " Waldstätten " ) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes .
In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re @-@ established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality .
The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory , with the admission of the cantons of Valais , Neuchâtel and Geneva .
The war lasted for less than a month , causing fewer than 100 casualties , most of which were through friendly fire .
Under General Henri Guisan central command , a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered .
Over the course of the war , Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cross , based in Geneva , played an important part during the conflict .
Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy , but not until the end of the 20th century .
On 18 April 1999 the Swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution .
Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA , but is not a member of the European Economic Area .
Nonetheless , Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU , and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union .
Switzerland , together with Liechtenstein , has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria 's membership in 1995 .
The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half .
If so , a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law .
Any 8 cantons together can also call a referendum on a federal law .
Similarly , the federal " constitutional initiative " allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote , if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months .

The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses , bacteria , or other microorganisms , and less commonly by certain drugs .
A needle is inserted into the spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , that envelops the brain and spinal cord .
Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand , foot and mouth disease and genital herpes , both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis .
= = = Early complications = = = Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness .
Endocarditis ( an infection of the heart valves which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream ) may cause aseptic meningitis .
= = = Bacterial = = = The types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis vary according to the infected individual 's age group .
" Listeria monocytogenes " ( serotype IVb ) may affect the newborn and occurs in epidemics .
Risk of infection with " Listeria monocytogenes " is increased in persons over 50 years old .
In these cases , the persons are more likely to be infected with Staphylococci , Pseudomonas , and other Gram @-@ negative bacteria .
An infection in the head and neck area , such as otitis media or mastoiditis , can lead to meningitis in a small proportion of people .
Anatomical defects allow continuity between the external environment and the nervous system .
The most common fungal meningitis is cryptococcal meningitis due to " Cryptococcus neoformans . "
= = = Parasitic = = = A parasitic cause is often assumed when there is a predominance of eosinophils ( a type of white blood cell ) in the CSF .
The most important test in identifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid through lumbar puncture ( LP , spinal tap ) .
However , lumbar puncture is contraindicated if there is a mass in the brain ( tumor or abscess ) or the intracranial pressure ( ICP ) is elevated , as it may lead to brain herniation .
The CSF sample is examined for presence and types of white blood cells , red blood cells , protein content and glucose level .
Gram staining is also less reliable in particular infections such as listeriosis .
Serology ( identification of antibodies to viruses ) may be useful in viral meningitis .
This has practically eliminated this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in young children in those countries .
In the countries where the disease burden is highest , however , the vaccine is still too expensive .
Meningococcus vaccines exist against groups A , B , C , W135 and Y.
Mechanical ventilation may be needed if the level of consciousness is very low , or if there is evidence of respiratory failure .
Seizures are treated with anticonvulsants .
The choice of initial treatment depends largely on the kind of bacteria that cause meningitis in a particular place and population .
Viral meningitis , in contrast , tends to resolve spontaneously and is rarely fatal .
With treatment , mortality ( risk of death ) from bacterial meningitis depends on the age of the person and the underlying cause .
Some of the hearing loss may be reversible .
Bacterial meningitis occurs in about 3 people per 100,000 annually in Western countries .
Population @-@ wide studies have shown that viral meningitis is more common , at 10.9 per 100,000 , and occurs more often in the summer .
In Brazil , the rate of bacterial meningitis is higher , at 45.8 per 100,000 annually .
The largest epidemic ever recorded in history swept across the entire region in 1996 @-@ 1997 , causing over 250,000 cases and 25,000 deaths .
The first recorded major outbreak occurred in Geneva in 1805 .
African epidemics became much more common in the 20th century , starting with a major epidemic sweeping Nigeria and Ghana in 1905 @-@ 1908 .
The first report of bacterial infection underlying meningitis was by the Austrian bacteriologist Anton Weichselbaum , who in 1887 described the " meningococcus . "
In 1906 , antiserum was produced in horses ; this was developed further by the American scientist Simon Flexner and markedly decreased mortality from meningococcal disease .
In 1944 , penicillin was first reported to be effective in meningitis .

Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids , proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells .
Other proteins are important in cell signaling , immune responses , cell adhesion , and the cell cycle .
All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features , including an α @-@ carbon to which an amino group , a carboxyl group , and a variable side chain are bonded .
Because DNA contains four nucleotides , the total number of possible codons is 64 ; hence , there is some redundancy in the genetic code , with some amino acids specified by more than one codon .
In contrast , eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm , where protein synthesis then takes place .
The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase " charges " the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids .
Proteins are always biosynthesized from N @-@ terminus to C @-@ terminus .
Yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass .
The largest known proteins are the titins , a component of the muscle sarcomere , with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids .
These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology , though generally not for commercial applications .
Biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein 's structure : * " Primary structure " : the amino acid sequence .
Because secondary structures are local , many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule .
* " Tertiary structure " : the overall shape of a single protein molecule ; the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another .
Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes .
Common experimental methods of structure determination include X @-@ ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy , both of which can produce information at atomic resolution .
Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) , a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein .
The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome .
The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or " pocket " on the molecular surface .
This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein , which defines the binding site pocket , and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids ' side chains .
= = = Enzymes = = = The best @-@ known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes , which catalyze chemical reactions .
= = = Cell signaling and ligand binding = = = Many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction .
Some proteins , such as insulin , are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues .
Antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens , or foreign substances in the body , and target them for destruction .
Many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism .
Other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin , kinesin , and dynein , which are capable of generating mechanical forces .
For natural proteins , a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications .
To simplify this process , genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity .
Here , a " tag " consisting of a specific amino acid sequence , often a series of histidine residues ( a " His @-@ tag " ) , is attached to one terminus of the protein .
= = = Cellular localization = = = The study of proteins " in vivo " is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell .
A useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a " reporter " such as green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
Through another genetic engineering application known as site @-@ directed mutagenesis , researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure , cellular localization , and susceptibility to regulation .
Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express .
Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering , in which novel protein folds have already been designed .
A more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions , such as in molecular docking and protein @-@ protein interaction prediction .
= = Nutrition = = Most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids , while animals ( including humans ) must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet .
In animals , amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein .
Amino acids are also an important dietary source of nitrogen .
Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1838 .
Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a ( nearly correct ) molecular weight of 131 Da .
Hence , early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities , e.g. , those of blood , egg white , various toxins , and digestive / metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses .

Maxwell 's equations are a set of partial differential equations that , together with the Lorentz force law , form the foundation of classical electrodynamics , classical optics , and electric circuits .
These fields in turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies .
Maxwell 's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents .
They are named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell , who published an early form of those equations between 1861 and 1862 .
The equations have two major variants .
The term " Maxwell 's equations " is often used for other forms of Maxwell 's equations .
Exceptions occur when the particle nature of light is important or for very strong electric fields .
The sources of these fields are electric charges and electric currents , which can be expressed as local densities namely charge density and current density .
A separate law of nature , the Lorentz force law , describes how the electric and magnetic field act on charged particles and currents .
Conventions differ with the unit systems , because various definitions and dimensions are changed by absorbing dimensionful factors like the speed of light .
Other units commonly used are Gaussian units based on the cgs system , Lorentz @-@ Heaviside units ( used mainly in particle physics ) , and Planck units ( used in theoretical physics ) .
See below for the formulation with Gaussian units .
( Vector area is also denoted by rather than , but this conflicts with the magnetic potential , a separate vector field ) .
Equivalent technical statements are that the sum total magnetic flux through any Gaussian surface is zero , or that the magnetic field is a solenoidal vector field .
This dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines just as the magnetic field , if not superposed by a static ( charge induced ) electric field .
This aspect of electromagnetic induction is the operating principle behind many electric generators : for example , a rotating bar magnet creates a changing magnetic field , which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire .
Maxwell understood the connection between electromagnetic waves and light in 1861 , thereby unifying the theories of electromagnetism and optics .
A sinusoidal plane wave is one special solution of these equations .
Maxwell 's equations explain how these waves can physically propagate through space .
This perpetual cycle allows these waves , now known as electromagnetic radiation , to move through space at velocity .
It is sometimes called the general form of Maxwell 's equations or " Maxwell 's equations in a vacuum . "
When using cgs units it is conventional to use a slightly different definition of electric field .
Often , they are also called the Maxwell equations .
The direct space @-@ time formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are relativistically invariant ( in fact studying the hidden symmetry of the vector calculus formulation was a major source of inspiration for relativity theory ) .
In addition , the formulation using potentials was originally introduced as a convenient way to solve the equations but with all the observable physics contained in the fields .
See the main articles for the details of each formulation .
Other formulations include the geometric algebra formulation and a matrix representation of Maxwell 's equations .
= = Solutions = = Maxwell 's equations are partial differential equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the electric charges and currents .
Often , the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the Lorentz force equation and the constitutive relations .
In fact , the solutions of these equations encompass all the diverse phenomena in the entire field of classical electromagnetism .
Like any differential equation , boundary conditions and initial conditions are necessary for a unique solution .
For example , even with no charges and no currents anywhere in spacetime , many solutions to Maxwell 's equations are possible , not just the obvious solution .
Another solution is , , while yet other solutions have electromagnetic waves filling spacetime .
Numerical methods for differential equations can be used to approximately solve Maxwell 's equations when an exact solution is impossible .
These methods usually require a computer , and include the finite element method and finite @-@ difference time @-@ domain method .
= = Variations = = Popular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well .
If they did exist , both Gauss 's law for magnetism and Faraday 's law would need to be modified , and the resulting four equations would be fully symmetric under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields .

It is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms , but one common definition is that it is the ability of a system to perform work .
An example is mechanical energy which is the sum of ( usually macroscopic ) kinetic and potential energy in a system .
.The list is also not necessarily complete .
The distinctions between different kinds of energy is not always clear @-@ cut .
Gustave @-@ Gaspard Coriolis described " kinetic energy " in 1829 in its modern sense , and in 1853 , William Rankine coined the term " potential energy . "
The law of conservation of energy , was also first postulated in the early 19th century , and applies to any isolated system .
It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance , dubbed the caloric , or merely a physical quantity , such as momentum .
In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat .
It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan .
It is equal to the energy expended ( or work done ) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre .
= = = Chemistry = = = In the context of chemistry , energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic , molecular or aggregate structure .
= = = Biology = = = In biology , energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism .
Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism .
For tasks lasting a few minutes , a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts .
For an activity that must be sustained for an hour , output drops to around 300 ; for an activity kept up all day , 150 watts is about the maximum .
In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from .
Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones , but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren .
Examples of transducers include a battery , from chemical energy to electric energy ; a dam : gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water ( and the blades of a turbine ) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator .
There are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be converted into other forms of energy via work , and heat as described by Carnot 's theorem and the second law of thermodynamics .
These limits are especially evident when an engine is used to perform work .
However , some energy transformations can be quite efficient .
This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil nuclear power generation .
Similarly , in the case of a chemical explosion , chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time .
Yet another example is that of a pendulum .
At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum .
At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy .
It is also equivalent to mass , and this mass is always associated with it .
In different theoretical frameworks , similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson ( 1881 ) , Henri Poincaré ( 1900 ) , Friedrich Hasenöhrl ( 1904 ) and others ( see Mass @-@ energy equivalence # History for further information ) .
A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen .
For example , conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another , is reversible , as in the pendulum system described above .
In this case , energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space , and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space .
This law is a fundamental principle of physics .
Put differently , yesterday , today , and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable .
This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time .
This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval .
The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured .
Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy , and all types of potential energy ( like all other types of energy ) appears as system mass , whenever present .
For example , a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed .
= = = Open systems = = = There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy .
Where formula _ 15 in this general equation represents other additional advected energy terms not covered by work done on a system , or heat added to it .
= = Thermodynamics = = = = = Internal energy = = = Internal energy is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system .
It is the energy needed to create the system .
It is related to the potential energy , e.g. , molecular structure , crystal structure , and other geometric aspects , as well as the motion of the particles , in form of kinetic energy .
The general formulation of the first law ( i.e. , conservation of energy ) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous .
= = = Equipartition of energy = = = The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator ( a mass on a spring ) is alternatively kinetic and potential .
At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic , and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential .
This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy , called entropy .
Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system .

Within cells , DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes .
These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins , helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed .
According to another study , when measured in a particular solution , the DNA chain measured 22 to 26 ångströms wide ( 2.2 to 2.6 nanometres ) , and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3 Å ( 0.33 nm ) long .
Although each individual repeating unit is very small , DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions of nucleotides .
For instance , the largest human chromosome , chromosome number 1 , consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and is 85 mm long .
These two long strands entwine like vines , in the shape of a double helix .
A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide .
The sugar in DNA is 2 @-@ deoxyribose , which is a pentose ( five @-@ carbon ) sugar .
One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar , with the 2 @-@ deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA .
The four bases found in DNA are adenine ( abbreviated A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) and thymine ( T ) .
The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper , either by a mechanical force or high temperature .
As a result of this complementarity , all the information in the double @-@ stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand , which is vital in DNA replication .
Indeed , this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms .
The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds , AT forming two hydrogen bonds , and GC forming three hydrogen bonds ( see figures , right ) .
In the laboratory , the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds , their melting temperature ( also called " Tm " value ) .
When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt , the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules .
= = = Sense and antisense = = = A DNA sequence is called " sense " if its sequence is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein .
One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA @-@ RNA base pairing .
In these cases , some DNA sequences do double duty , encoding one protein when read along one strand , and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand .
If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix , this is positive supercoiling , and the bases are held more tightly together .
If they are twisted in the opposite direction , this is negative supercoiling , and the bases come apart more easily .
These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z @-@ DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription .
The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen .
The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes .
The details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome .
The genetic information in a genome is held within genes , and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype .
A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism .
In many species , only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein .
However , some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non @-@ coding RNA molecules , which are involved in the regulation of gene expression .
Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes .
Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes , but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes .
These sequences are usually just molecular fossils , although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence .
Within a gene , the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence , which then defines one or more protein sequences .
These encode the twenty standard amino acids , giving most amino acids more than one possible codon .
There are also three ' stop ' or ' nonsense ' codons signifying the end of the coding region ; these are the TAA , TGA , and TAG codons .
Here , the two strands are separated and then each strand 's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase .
As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction , different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix .
In this way , the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand , and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA .
= = Interactions with proteins = = All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins .
Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these , the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important .
These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin .
The transcription factors do this in two ways .
Consequently , these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development .
The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases , which cut DNA at specific sequences .
For instance , the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6 @-@ base sequence 5 ′ -GATATC @-@ 3 ′ and makes a cut at the vertical line .
In nature , these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell , acting as part of the restriction modification system .
They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination .
These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA .
To begin transcribing a gene , the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands .
The four separate DNA strands are coloured red , blue , green and yellow .
Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins .
A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction , in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix .
The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes , swapping one strand for another .
However , there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems , as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible .
This is because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years , and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution .
= = = Forensics = = = Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood , semen , skin , saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual , such as a perpetrator .
This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA .
DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys , and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case .
String searching or matching algorithms , which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters , were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides .
These techniques , especially multiple sequence alignment , are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function .
DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information .
= = History of DNA research = = DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who , in 1869 , discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages .
In 1919 , Phoebus Levene identified the base , sugar and phosphate nucleotide unit .

DNA 's role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 , when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey @-@ Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the T2 phage .
Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of " Nature . "
In 1962 , after Franklin 's death , Watson , Crick , and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine .
A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery .
Further work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non @-@ overlapping triplets of bases , called codons , allowing Har Gobind Khorana , Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code .
These findings represent the birth of molecular biology .

Victor Marie Hugo ( ; ; 26 February 1802 - 22 May 1885 ) was a French poet , novelist , and dramatist of the Romantic movement .
Since Hugo 's father was an officer , the family moved frequently and Hugo learned much from these travels .
Young Victor fell in love and , against his mother 's wishes , became secretly engaged to his childhood friend Adèle Foucher ( 1803 @-@ 1868 ) .
Because of his close relationship with his mother , Hugo waited until after his mother 's death ( in 1821 ) to marry Adèle in 1822 .
Adèle and Victor Hugo had their first child , Léopold , in 1823 , but the boy died in infancy .
Hugo 's oldest and favorite daughter , Léopoldine , died at age 19 in 1843 , shortly after her marriage to Charles Vacquerie .
His most famous poem is probably " Demain , dès l 'aube , " in which he describes visiting her grave .
After the Siege of Paris , Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873 , before finally returning to France for the remainder of his life .
Like Chateaubriand , Hugo would further the cause of Romanticism , become involved in politics ( though mostly as a champion of Republicanism ) , and be forced into exile due to his political stances .
" Le Dernier jour d 'un condamné " ( " The Last Day of a Condemned Man " ) would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus , Charles Dickens , and Fyodor Dostoevsky .
The pamphlets were banned in France , but nonetheless had a strong impact there .
= = Declining years and death = = When Hugo returned to Paris in 1870 , the country hailed him as a national hero .
His faithful mistress , Juliette Drouet , died in 1883 , only two years before his own death .
Hugo suffered a mild stroke on 27 June 1878 .
He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature , he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France .
He shares a crypt within the Panthéon with Alexandre Dumas and Émile Zola .
Hugo left five sentences as his last will , to be officially published : : " " Je donne cinquante mille francs aux pauvres .
: I believe in God .
The history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge , including both the natural sciences and social sciences .
( The history of the arts and humanities is termed as the history of scholarship .
) Science is a body of empirical , theoretical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who emphasize the observation , explanation , and prediction of real world phenomena .
The English word " scientist " is relatively recent - first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century .
For example , the domestication of maize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico , before the development of writing systems .
Many ancient civilizations collected astronomical information in a systematic manner through simple observation .
Though they had no knowledge of the real physical structure of the planets and stars , many theoretical explanations were proposed .
Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places , and alchemy was practiced in several civilizations .

Only a few astronomers ' names are known , such as that of Kidinnu , a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician .
" Ancient Egypt made significant advances in astronomy , mathematics and medicine .
However , while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices , it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices .
Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology , for example , was largely ineffective .

A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton 's publications , " Introduction to the History of Science " ( 1927 ) and the " Isis " journal ( founded in 1912 ) .
Sarton exemplified the early 20th @-@ century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas .
The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period , and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians .
With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard , the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945 .
The history of mathematics , history of technology , and history of philosophy are distinct areas of research and are covered in other articles .
Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth .
History of science is an academic discipline , with an international community of specialists .
Main professional organizations for this field include the History of Science Society , the British Society for the History of Science , and the European Society for the History of Science .
The field of Science and Technology Studies , an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science , focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods .

The earliest findings are from the Kofun period ( 3rd to 6th century ) .
Like in Europe , the wealthier homes had a separate building which served for cooking .
A kind of open fire pit fired with charcoal , called " irori , " remained in use as the secondary stove in most homes until the Edo period ( 17th to 19th century ) .
A " kamado " was used to cook the staple food , for instance rice , while " irori " served both to cook side dishes and as a heat source .
In wealthy homes , the ground floor was often used as a stable while the kitchen was located on the floor above , like the bedroom and the hall .
In Japanese homes , the kitchen started to become a separate room within the main building at that time .
Leonardo da Vinci invented an automated system for a rotating spit for spit @-@ roasting : a propeller in the chimney made the spit turn all by itself .
This kind of system was widely used in wealthier homes .
Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet ; they kept the one @-@ room arrangement where all activities took place , or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall .
In a few European farmhouses , the smoke kitchen was in regular use until the middle of the 20th century .
Benjamin Thompson in England designed his " Rumford stove " around 1800 .
These stoves were still fired with wood or coal .
But like the gas stove , the electric stove had a slow start .
The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room , and even as a bathroom .
Water pipes were laid only towards the end of the 19th century , and then often only with one tap per building or per story .
The kitchen , located in the basement or the ground floor , continued to be operated by servants .
In some houses , water pumps were installed , and some even had kitchen sinks and drains ( but no water on tap yet , except for some feudal kitchens in castles ) .
A large table served as a workbench ; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants , for the table in the kitchen also doubled as the eating place for the servants .
Living in smaller apartments , the kitchen was the main room - here , the family lived .
The study or living room was saved for special occasions such as an occasional dinner invitation .
Gas was more expensive than coal , though , and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealthier homes .
Gas and water pipes were first installed in the big cities ; small villages were connected only much later .
Social housing projects led to the next milestone : the Frankfurt Kitchen .
But the Frankfurt kitchen embodied a standard for the rest of the 20th century in rental apartments : the " work kitchen . "
Practical reasons also played a role in this development : just as in the bourgeois homes of the past , one reason for separating the kitchen was to keep the steam and smells of cooking out of the living room .
The equipment used remained a standard for years to come : hot and cold water on tap and a kitchen sink and an electrical or gas stove and oven .
Not much later , the refrigerator was added as a standard item .
At Antelope Valley High School , Zappa met Don Vliet ( who later expanded his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name Captain Beefheart ) .
Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London .
Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett , Nick Mason , Roger Waters , and Richard Wright .
Barrett 's performances were enthusiastic , " leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting .
Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them , becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project , and so the band turned to Brian Humphries .
Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd .
In 2008 , King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music ; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award .

He sings in French , Spanish , English , Italian , Arabic , Galician , and Portuguese and occasionally in other languages .
Chao began his musical career in Paris , busking and playing with groups such as Hot Pants and Los Carayos , which combined a variety of languages and musical styles .
Los Carayos remained a side project of the artists for eight years , releasing three albums in the first two years followed by a final album in 1994 .
In 1987 , the Chao brothers and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the multiracial band Mano Negra .
Manu Chao is friends with Gogol Bordello and that group has covered Mano Negra 's song " Mala Vida " on their own and with Chao beginning in 2006 .
The songs were collectively released as " Clandestino " in 1998 , under Manu Chao 's own name .
Chao 's second album with Radio Bemba Sound System , , " " was released in 2001 .
" Rainin in Paradize " was the first single from the album , available for download on his website before the release of the album .
In 1994 Vai received a Grammy Award for his performance on the Frank Zappa song " Sofa " from the album " Zappa 's Universe . "
Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible , ultraviolet , and infrared light .
Because light is an electromagnetic wave , other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X @-@ rays , microwaves , and radio waves exhibit similar properties .
Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation .
Explanation of these effects requires quantum mechanics .
The first wearable eyeglasses were invented in Italy around 1286 .
In 1690 , Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory for light based on suggestions that had been made by Robert Hooke in 1664 .
Newtonian optics was generally accepted until the early 19th century when Thomas Young and Augustin @-@ Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light 's wave nature .
This work led to a theory of diffraction for light and opened an entire area of study in physical optics .
Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s .
In 1905 Albert Einstein published the theory of the photoelectric effect that firmly established the quantization of light itself .
= = Classical optics = = Classical optics is divided into two main branches : geometrical optics and physical optics .
: The law of reflection says that the reflected ray lies in the plane of incidence , and the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence .
The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically , with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material .
This is known as the Law of Reflection .
Mirrors with curved surfaces can be modelled by ray @-@ tracing and using the law of reflection at each point on the surface .
In particular , spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration .
The angle of incidence required for such a scenario is known as Brewster 's angle .
Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance ; the closer the object is to the lens , the further the image is from the lens .
Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal length , and on the same side of the lens as the object .
Similar to mirrors , upright images produced by single lenses are virtual while inverted images are real .
These are due to both to geometrical imperfections and due to the changing index of refraction for different wavelengths of light ( chromatic aberration ) .

As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically , study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics .
This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets .
Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton @-@ proton reaction and the CNO cycle nuclear fusion .
As a plasma , hydrogen 's electron and proton are not bound together , resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity ( producing the light from the Sun and other stars ) .
For example , in the solar wind they interact with the Earth 's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora .

= = Physical characteristics = = = = = Internal structure = = = The Moon is a differentiated body : it has a geochemically distinct crust , mantle , and core .
This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon 's formation 4.5 billion years ago .
Today , many of these claims are thought to be illusory , resulting from observation under different lighting conditions , poor astronomical seeing , or inadequate drawings .
Recently , it has been suggested that a roughly diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago .
Solar eclipses occur at new moon , when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth .
In contrast , lunar eclipses occur at full moon , when Earth is between the Sun and Moon .
Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time , the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing .
Likewise , hundreds of millions of years in the future , the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely , and total solar eclipses will not occur .
The first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was " Luna 9 " and the first unmanned vehicle to orbit the Moon was " Luna 10 , " both in 1966 .
In 1990 , Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its " Hiten " spacecraft .

DNA computing , or , more generally , biomolecular computing , is a fast @-@ developing interdisciplinary area .
In 2002 , researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , unveiled a programmable molecular computing machine composed of enzymes and DNA molecules instead of silicon microchips .
For certain specialized problems , DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far .
For example , if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem ( EXPSPACE problems ) on von Neumann machines , it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines .
For very large EXPSPACE problems , the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical .

Today , the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism ( Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism ) , Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism .
In modern times , Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma .
Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women , some only to the ancient priestly groups , the Kohanim and Leviyim ( members of the tribe of Levi ) , some only to farmers within the Land of Israel .

Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non @-@ Orthodox oriented philosophy .
Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler , Joseph B. Soloveitchik , and Yitzchok Hutner .
Well @-@ known non @-@ Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber , Franz Rosenzweig , Mordecai Kaplan , Abraham Joshua Heschel , Will Herberg , and Emmanuel Lévinas .
Consequently , in his view , Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories , such as religion , ethnicity , or culture .

= = = Who is a Jew ? = = = According to traditional Jewish Law , a Jew is anyone born of a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism in accordance with Jewish Law .
Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish .
According to the " Jewish Year Book " ( 1901 ) , the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million .
In 2002 , according to the Jewish Population Survey , there were 13.3 million Jews around the world .
The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million .
Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent , with 0.3 % growth from 2000 to 2001 .
* Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses , and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging .
Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static , but has always developed in response to changing conditions .

* Yom Kippur , ( " Day of Atonement " ) is the holiest day of the Jewish year .
On the eve of Yom Kippur , before candles are lit , a prefast meal , the " seuda mafseket , " is eaten .
Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer .
It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur , especially for Kol Nidre , and leather shoes are not worn .

In the Reform movement , both girls and boys have their bat / bar mitzvah at age thirteen .
A wedding takes place under a " chuppah , " or wedding canopy , which symbolizes a happy house .
Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty .
Today , a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah .
Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles , which are sometimes , but not always , filled by a rabbi and / or hazzan in many congregations .
The requirements for being the " baal kriyah " are the same as those for the " shatz . "
Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services ( or parts of services ) will be led by each .

As time went on , the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the Philistines to capture the tabernacle .
The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara , rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries .
The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship , Palestine and Babylonia .
The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud .
After Solomon 's reign the nation split into two kingdoms , the Kingdom of Israel ( in the north ) and the Kingdom of Judah ( in the south ) .
A new Second Temple was constructed , and old religious practices were resumed .
During the early years of the Second Temple , the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly , led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra .
Nevertheless , early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non @-@ Hasidic Jews .
Since then differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism .
The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world , thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience .
Due to intermarriage and low birth rates , the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5 million in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2001 .
This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the Diaspora , but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities , such as Haredi Judaism .
The Baal teshuva movement is a movement of Jews who have " returned " to religion or become more observant .

Hypertension ( HTN or HT ) or high blood pressure , sometimes called arterial hypertension , is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated .
Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100 @-@ 140 mmHg systolic ( top reading ) and 60 @-@ 90 mmHg diastolic ( bottom reading ) .
High blood pressure is said to be present if it is often at or above 140 / 90 mmHg .
= = Signs and symptoms = = Hypertension is rarely accompanied by any symptoms , and its identification is usually through screening , or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem .
Chest pain may indicate heart muscle damage ( which may progress to myocardial infarction ) or sometimes aortic dissection , the tearing of the inner wall of the aorta .
Rapid deterioration of kidney function ( acute kidney injury ) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( destruction of blood cells ) may also occur .
In these situations , rapid reduction of the blood pressure is mandated to stop ongoing organ damage .
Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors .
Numerous common genetic variants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified as well as some rare genetic variants with large effects on blood pressure but the genetic basis of hypertension is still poorly understood .
The possible role of other factors such as caffeine consumption , and vitamin D deficiency are less clear .
Insulin resistance , which is common in obesity and is a component of syndrome X ( or the metabolic syndrome ) , is also thought to contribute to hypertension .
Kidney disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension .
Hypertension can also be caused by endocrine conditions , such as Cushing 's syndrome , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism , acromegaly , Conn 's syndrome or hyperaldosteronism , hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma .
Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity , sleep apnea , pregnancy , coarctation of the aorta , excessive liquorice consumption and certain prescription medicines , herbal remedies and illegal drugs .
= = Pathophysiology = = In most people with established essential ( primary ) hypertension , increased resistance to blood flow ( total peripheral resistance ) accounts for the high pressure while cardiac output remains normal .
Pulse pressure ( the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure ) is frequently increased in older people with hypertension .
= = Diagnosis = = Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of a persistent high blood pressure .
Secondary hypertension is more common in preadolescent children , with most cases caused by kidney disease .
Additional tests for diabetes and high cholesterol levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of heart disease and may require treatment .
eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on kidney function .
Additionally , testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease .
Electrocardiogram ( EKG / ECG ) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure .
It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle ( left ventricular hypertrophy ) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack .
= = Management = = = = = Lifestyle modifications = = = The first line of treatment for hypertension is identical to the recommended preventive lifestyle changes and includes dietary changes , physical exercise , and weight loss .
Dietary change , such as a low sodium diet and a vegetarian diet are beneficial .
A long term ( more than 4 weeks ) low sodium diet is effective in reducing blood pressure , both in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure .
A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium , although the diet is also rich in potassium , magnesium , calcium , as well as protein .
= = = = Drug combinations = = = = The majority of people require more than one drug to control their hypertension .
= = = Elderly = = = Treating moderate to severe hypertension decreases death rates and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people aged 60 and older .
As of 2000 , nearly one billion people or ~ 26 % of the adult population of the world had hypertension .
It was common in both developed ( 333 million ) and undeveloped ( 639 million ) countries .
Hypertension is more common in men ( though menopause tends to decrease this difference ) and in those of low socioeconomic status .
Kidney disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension in children and adolescents .
The English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733 .
Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from Thomas Young in 1808 and especially Richard Bright in 1836 .
The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by Frederick Akbar Mahomed ( 1849 @-@ 1884 ) .
However hypertension as a clinical entity came into being in 1896 with the invention of the cuff @-@ based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva @-@ Rocci in 1896 .
This was advocated by The Yellow Emperor of China , Cornelius Celsus , Galen , and Hippocrates .
= = Society and culture = = = = = Awareness = = = The World Health Organization has identified hypertension , or high blood pressure , as the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality .

In physics , classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are the two major sub @-@ fields of mechanics .
The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one , making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in science , engineering and technology .
The initial stage in the development of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics , and is associated with the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by Newton himself , in parallel with Leibniz , and others .
Later , more abstract and general methods were developed , leading to reformulations of classical mechanics known as Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics .
( The physics of " very " small particles , such as the electron , is more accurately described by quantum mechanics .
Classical mechanics is the same extreme high frequency approximation as geometric optics .
including the special and general theories of relativity ) , for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light .
* Statistical mechanics , which provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk thermodynamic properties of materials .

Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light , Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave .
Electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics .
Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by travelling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum .
However , in nonlinear media , such as some crystals , interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields - these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect .
Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances .
Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size , from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei .
Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern .
The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy .
Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete , each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies .
These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms .
= = = Propagation speed = = = Any electric charge that accelerates , or any changing magnetic field , produces electromagnetic radiation .
When any wire ( or other conducting object such as an antenna ) conducts alternating current , electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current .
As a wave , light is characterized by a velocity ( the speed of light ) , wavelength , and frequency .
One rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances : EM radiation in a vacuum travels at the speed of light , " relative to the observer , " regardless of the observer 's velocity .
( This observation led to Einstein 's development of the theory of special relativity .
) In a medium ( other than vacuum ) , velocity factor or refractive index are considered , depending on frequency and application .
Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum .

Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter .
The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films .
= = Life and career = = = = = Childhood and youth ( 1910 @-@ 35 ) = = = Kurosawa was born on 23 March 1910 in Ōimachi in the Ōmori district of Tokyo .
During this time , the boy also studied calligraphy and Kendo swordsmanship .
In the last of Kurosawa 's films as an assistant director , " Horse " ( " Uma , " 1941 ) , Kurosawa took over most of the production , as Yamamoto was occupied with the shooting of another film .
) The movie became both a critical and commercial success .
During production , the actress playing the leader of the factory workers , Yōko Yaguchi , was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director .
By this time , Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun .
The movie bears the influence of Frank Capra , D. W. Griffith and F. W. Murnau .
It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune .
Kurosawa , with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto , Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi , formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association ( Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai ) .
For this organization 's debut work , and first film for Daiei studios , Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and , together with Taniguchi , adapted it for the screen .
For his first foreign project , Kurosawa chose a story based on a Life magazine article .
Almost twenty years later , another foreigner working in Hollywood , Andrei Konchalovsky , would finally make " Runaway Train , " though from a script totally different from Kurosawa 's .
The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project .
He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni , but very soon the project began to unravel .
( He was ultimately replaced , for the film 's Japanese sequences , with two directors , Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda .
) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator , writer Ryuzo Kikushima , and never worked with him again .
Worst of all , the Japanese film industry - and perhaps the man himself - began to suspect that he would never make another film .
The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve .
In early 1973 , the Soviet studio Mosfilm approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them .
Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him , he had no interest in working outside the film world .

Early behavioral , cognitive , or speech interventions can help children with autism gain self @-@ care , social , and communication skills .
Other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis .
Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name .
= = = Communication = = = About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs .
* Restricted behavior is limited in focus , interest , or activity , such as preoccupation with a single television program , toy or game .
= = = Other symptoms = = = Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family .
Selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ; this does not appear to result in malnutrition .
Its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors .
This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors .
Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life , and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response .
The mirror neuron system ( MNS ) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism 's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties .
Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex .
The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition .
An extension , the extreme male brain theory , hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing .
One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people .
These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism .
ICD @-@ 10 uses essentially the same definition .
Two are commonly used in autism research : the Autism Diagnostic Interview @-@ Revised ( ADI @-@ R ) is a semistructured parent interview , and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) uses observation and interaction with the child .
The Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children .
Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause .
As new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge .
No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child 's needs .
Available approaches include applied behavior analysis ( ABA ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy .
A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications , the medications can have adverse effects , and no known medication relieves autism 's core symptoms of social and communication impairments .
Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies .
Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing , training availability , and parent requests .
After childhood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sexuality , social skills , and estate planning .
Children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not .
Most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self @-@ determination .
Rates of PDD @-@ NOS 's has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000 , Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000 , and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000 .
The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s .
Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 .
As late as the mid @-@ 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions .
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely .
Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .
" Most bacteria have not been characterized , and only about half of the phyla of bacteria have species that can be grown in the laboratory .
The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections , with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year , mostly in sub @-@ Saharan Africa .
= = Origin and early evolution = = The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago .
For about 3 billion years , all organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life .
However , gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny , and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal / eukaryotic lineage .
Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus " Mycoplasma , " which measure only 0.3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses .
Some bacteria may be even smaller , but these ultramicrobacteria are not well @-@ studied .
These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to up to half a meter in depth , and may contain multiple species of bacteria , protists and archaea .
In natural environments , such as soil or the surfaces of plants , the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms .
Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible .
The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA .
Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi , which are made of cellulose and chitin , respectively .
The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria , and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan .
This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier .
Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens , so are intensively studied .
The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy , but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications .
Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of carbon , and the electron donors used for growth .
Carbon metabolism in bacteria is either " heterotrophic , " where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources , or " autotrophic , " meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide .
This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise ATP and drive metabolism .
In " anaerobic organisms " other inorganic compounds , such as nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors .
Fermentation is possible , because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products , which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism .
Lithotrophic bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy .
Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen , carbon monoxide , ammonia ( leading to nitrification ) , ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions , and several reduced sulfur compounds .
In unusual circumstances , the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism .
In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in photosynthesis , some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas ( nitrogen fixation ) using the enzyme nitrogenase .
This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above , but is not universal .
= = Growth and reproduction = = Unlike in multicellular organisms , increases in cell size ( cell growth ) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms .
Under optimal conditions , bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly , and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8 minutes .
However , liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required .
The use of selective media ( media with specific nutrients added or deficient , or with antibiotics added ) can help identify specific organisms .
Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly .
However , in natural environments , nutrients are limited , meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely .
This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies ( see r / K selection theory ) .
These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ( syntrophy ) .
The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the " growth rate " ( " k " ) , and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the " generation time " ( " g " ) .
The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair , antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport .
Spirochaetes of the genus " Borrelia " are a notable exception to this arrangement , with bacteria such as " Borrelia burgdorferi , " the cause of Lyme disease , containing a single linear chromosome .
The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria , these are much more rare than in eukaryotes .
However , all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material DNA caused by genetic recombination or mutations .
Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens .
Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria .
= = = DNA transfer = = = Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells .
This can occur in three main ways .
Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .
Many bacteria ( such as " E. coli " ) have two distinct modes of movement : forward movement ( swimming ) and tumbling .
The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology ( ICSB ) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria .
These two domains , along with Eukarya , are the basis of the three @-@ domain system , which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiolology .
For example , a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from Gram @-@ positive bacteria .
The " Gram stain , " developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram , characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls .
Culture techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria , while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample .
Specimens that are normally sterile , such as blood , urine or spinal fluid , are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms .
Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated , it can be further characterised by its morphology , growth patterns ( such as aerobic or anaerobic growth ) , patterns of hemolysis , and staining .
The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings .
Only the intimate association with the hydrogen @-@ consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow .
Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms .
A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after , as was the case with " Helicobacter pylori " and peptic ulcer disease .
Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts .
Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all .
Finally , some species such as " Pseudomonas aeruginosa , " " Burkholderia cenocepacia , " and " Mycobacterium avium " are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis .
Fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 " Exxon Valdez " oil spill .
These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil .
In the chemical industry , bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals .
Because of their specificity , these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly , with little or no effect on humans , wildlife , pollinators and most other beneficial insects .

Everything is in constant flux , and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing .
According to the doctrine of impermanence , life embodies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth ( saṃsāra ) , and in any experience of loss .
The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( dukkha ) .

It is an action committed through the body , speech , or mind , and involves an intentional effort .
It is one of the " three practices " ( " sila , " " samadhi , " and " panya " ) and the second " pāramitā . "
It refers to moral purity of thought , word , and deed .
According to the Law of Karma , keeping the precepts are meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects .

To refrain from eating at the wrong time ( eat only from sunrise to noon ) ; : 7 .
To refrain from using high or luxurious seats and bedding .
It includes the Patimokkha , a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension .
The precise content of the vinayapitaka ( scriptures on Vinaya ) differs slightly according to different schools , and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya .
On the other hand , the rules themselves are designed to assure a satisfying life , and provide a perfect springboard for the higher attainments .
= = = Meditation = = = Buddhist meditation is fundamentally concerned with two themes : transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena .
According to Theravada Buddhism the Buddha taught two types of meditation , " samatha " meditation ( Sanskrit : " śamatha " ) and " vipassanā " meditation ( Sanskrit : " vipaśyanā " ) .
In Chinese Buddhism , these exist ( translated " chih kuan " ) , but Chán ( Zen ) meditation is more popular .
According to Peter Harvey , whenever Buddhism has been healthy , not only monks , nuns , and married lamas , but also more committed lay people have practiced meditation .
According to Routledge 's Encyclopedia of Buddhism , in contrast , throughout most of Buddhist history before modern times , serious meditation by lay people has been unusual .
Once the conceptual understanding is attained , it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha 's teaching at a practical level .
It accepts all the basic concepts of Mahāyāna , but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice .
Using these techniques , it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime , or even as little as three years .
In the Tibetan tradition , these practices can include sexual yoga , though only for some very advanced practitioners .

They had two other children : a daughter , Elisabeth Förster @-@ Nietzsche , born in 1846 , and a second son , Ludwig Joseph , born in 1848 .
Nietzsche 's father died from a brain ailment in 1849 ; Ludwig Joseph died the next year , at age two .
After the death of Nietzsche 's grandmother in 1856 , the family moved into their own house , now Nietzsche @-@ Haus , a museum and Nietzsche study center .
Nietzsche attended a boys ' school and then , later , a private school , where he became friends with Gustav Krug , Rudolf Wagner , and Wilhelm Pinder , all of whom came from highly respected families .
In 1854 , he began to attend Domgymnasium in Naumburg but since he showed particular talents in music and language , the internationally recognized Schulpforta admitted him as a pupil .
He transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864 , becoming friends with Paul Deussen and Carl von Gersdorff .
He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions .
His end @-@ of @-@ semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German ; a 2a in Greek and Latin ; a 2b in French , History , and Physics ; and a " lackluster " 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics .
After graduation in 1864 , Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the University of Bonn .
After one semester ( and to the anger of his mother ) he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith .
In 1865 , at the age of 20 , Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth , who was deeply religious , a letter regarding his loss of faith .
There , he became close friends with his fellow student Erwin Rohde .
In 1865 , Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of Arthur Schopenhauer .
Consequently Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again , completing them and meeting with Richard Wagner for the first time later that year .
= = = Professor at Basel ( 1869 @-@ 78 ) = = = In part because of Ritschl 's support , Nietzsche received a remarkable offer to become professor of classical philology at the University of Basel in Switzerland .
Before moving to Basel , Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship : for the rest of his life he remained officially stateless .
Walter Kaufmann speculates that he might also have contracted syphilis along with his other infections at this time .
Nietzsche also met Franz Overbeck , a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life .
Nietzsche had already met Richard Wagner in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner 's wife , Cosima .
Nietzsche admired both greatly and , during his time at Basel , he frequently visited Wagner 's house in Tribschen in Lucerne .
In 1870 , he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of " The Genesis of the Tragic Idea " as a birthday gift .
In response , Rohde ( then a professor in Kiel ) and Wagner came to Nietzsche 's defense .
The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique , challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner .
Nietzsche 's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well .
( Since his childhood , various disruptive illnesses had plagued him , including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind , migraine headaches , and violent indigestion .
He spent many summers in Sils Maria near St. Moritz in Switzerland .
He spent his winters in the Italian cities of Genoa , Rapallo , and Turin and the French city of Nice .
In 1881 , when France occupied Tunisia , he planned to travel to Tunis to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea , probably for health reasons .
Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family , and , especially during this time , he and his sister had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation .
He is known to have tried using the Hansen Writing Ball , a contemporary typewriter device .
In the end , a past student of his , Heinrich Köselitz or Peter Gast , became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche .
In 1876 , Gast transcribed the crabbed , nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth .
On at least one occasion on February 23 , 1880 , the usually broke Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend , Paul Rée .
Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him .
To the end of his life , Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends .
Malwida von Meysenbug remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle .
Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music @-@ critic Carl Fuchs .
In 1882 , Nietzsche published the first part of " The Gay Science . "
That year he also met Lou Andreas Salomé , through Malwida von Meysenbug and Paul Rée .
Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in Tautenburg in Thuringia , often with Nietzsche 's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone .
Nietzsche , however , regarded Salomé less as an equal partner than as a gifted student .
Nietzsche 's relationship with Rée and Salomé broke up in the winter of 188283 , partially because of intrigues conducted by Elisabeth .
Here he wrote the first part of " Thus Spoke Zarathustra " in only ten days .
After severing his philosophical ties with Schopenhauer ( who was long dead and never met Nietzsche ) and his social ties with Wagner , Nietzsche had few remaining friends .
His books remained largely unsold .
In 1885 , he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of " Zarathustra " and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends , including Helene von Druskowitz .
In 1883 he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the University of Leipzig .
During these years Nietzsche met Meta von Salis , Carl Spitteler , and Gottfried Keller .
During the same year , he encountered the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky , to whom he felt an immediate kinship .
He also exchanged letters with Hippolyte Taine and Georg Brandes .
In the beginning of 1888 , Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche 's philosophy .
In December , Nietzsche began a correspondence with August Strindberg and thought that , short of an international breakthrough , he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages .
= = = Mental breakdown and death ( 1889 @-@ 1900 ) = = = On 3 January 1889 , Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse .
In the following few days , Nietzsche sent short writings - known as the " Wahnbriefe " ( " Madness Letters " ) - to a number of friends including Cosima Wagner and Jacob Burckhardt .
Also , last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn @-@ out manner .
Wilhelm , Bismarck , and all anti @-@ Semites abolished .
" Additionally , he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany .
On 6 January 1889 , Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck .
The following day , Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche 's friends had to bring him back to Basel .
By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness , and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in Jena under the direction of Otto Binswanger .
In March 1890 , Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and , in May 1890 , brought him to her home in Naumburg .
During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche 's unpublished works .
In February , they ordered a fifty @-@ copy private edition of " Nietzsche contra Wagner , " but the publisher C. G. Naumann secretly printed one hundred .
In 1893 , Nietzsche 's sister Elisabeth returned from Nueva Germania in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband .
Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother 's philosophy .
Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months , declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy .
After contracting pneumonia in mid @-@ August 1900 , he had another stroke during the night of 24 @-@ 25 August and died at about noon on 25 August .
Elisabeth had him buried beside his father at the church in Röcken bei Lützen .
( For example , Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of " The Antichrist , " where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible .
Others do not assign him a national category .
His birthplace , Röcken , is in the modern German state of Saxony @-@ Anhalt .
Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with Paul Rée .
The organicism of Paul Bourget influenced Nietzsche , as did that of Rudolf Virchow and Alfred Espinas .

In the first case , Sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus , but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way .
However , historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king , namely Eric the Victorious ( Geat ) and his son Olof Skötkonung in the 10th century .
Earlier kings , for which no reliable historical sources exist , can be read about in mythical kings of Sweden and semi @-@ legendary kings of Sweden .

Évariste Galois ( ; 25 October 1811 - 31 May 1832 ) was a French mathematician born in Bourg @-@ la @-@ Reine .
He soon became bored with his studies and , at the age of 14 , he began to take a serious interest in mathematics .
He found a copy of Adrien Marie Legendre 's " Éléments de Géométrie , " which , it is said , he read " like a novel " and mastered at the first reading .
On 28 July 1829 Galois 's father committed suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest .
Having been denied admission to the Polytechnique , Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the École Normale .
The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi .
The second one was about the numerical resolution of equations ( root finding in modern terminology ) .
While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets during " les Trois Glorieuses , " Galois and all the other students at the École Normale were locked in by the school 's director .
He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations .
Due to controversy surrounding the unit , soon after Galois became a member , on 31 December 1830 , the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government .
On the following Bastille Day ( 14 July 1831 ) , Galois was at the head of a protest , wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery , and came heavily armed with several pistols , a rifle , and a dagger .
During his imprisonment , he continued developing his mathematical ideas .
= = = Final days = = = Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale , although he continued to spend time in political activities .
Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 .
What is known is that five days before his death , he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair .
This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died .
There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral , but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque 's death , and the funeral was postponed without any uprising occurring .
He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup .

Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System .
Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet .

Some viruses employ techniques that make detection by means of signatures difficult but probably not impossible .
In this case , the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus code .
If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file , the only part of the virus that remains constant is the decrypting module , which would ( for example ) be appended to the end .
In this case , a virus scanner cannot directly detect the virus using signatures , but it can still detect the decrypting module , which still makes indirect detection of the virus possible .
To enable polymorphic code , the virus has to have a polymorphic engine ( also called mutating engine or mutation engine ) somewhere in its encrypted body .
A metamorphic virus is usually very large and complex .
This way , if data is lost through a virus , one can start again using the backup ( which will hopefully be recent ) .

= = Theories formally and scientifically = = Theories are analytical tools for understanding , explaining , and making predictions about a given subject matter .
There are theories in many and varied fields of study , including the arts and sciences .
Theories in various fields of study are expressed in natural language , but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic .
Theories may be expressed mathematically , symbolically , or in common language , but are generally expected to follow principles of rational thought or logic .
Sometimes two theories have exactly the same explanatory power because they make the same predictions .
The form of theories is studied formally in mathematical logic , especially in model theory .
Obvious examples include arithmetic ( abstracting concepts of number ) , geometry ( concepts of space ) , and probability ( concepts of randomness and likelihood ) .
As a result , some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized , accurately and completely , as mathematical theories .

Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world ; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts .
By the late 1970s and early 1980s , Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet state budget .
By the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 1980s , the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones .
Meanwhile , the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction .
The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport .

Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real , a consequence of worsening health conditions and services .
The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials , and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years .
Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late @-@ 1980s , when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes .

Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR .
Before Leonid Brezhnev became head of state , the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists .
After the socialist revolution , the life expectancy for all age groups went up .
This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system .
It remained stable during most years , although in the 1970s , it went down slightly , possibly because of alcohol abuse .
At the same time , infant mortality began to rise .

People communicated with one another using systems developed for specific mainframe computers .
As more computers were interconnected , especially in the US Government 's ARPANET , standards were developed to allow users of different systems to e @-@ mail one another .
SMTP grew out of these standards developed during the 1970s .
Further implementations include FTP Mail and Mail Protocol , both from 1973 .
Development work continued throughout the 1970s , until the ARPANET transitioned into the modern Internet around 1980 .
SMTP was published as RFC 788 in November 1981 , also by Postel .
The SMTP standard was developed around the same time as Usenet , a one @-@ to @-@ many communication network with some similarities .
SMTP became widely used in the early 1980s .
At the time , it was a complement to Unix to Unix Copy Program ( UUCP ) mail , which was better suited for handling e @-@ mail transfers between machines that were intermittently connected .
SMTP , on the other hand , works best when both the sending and receiving machines are connected to the network all the time .
Both use a store and forward mechanism and are examples of push technology .
Though Usenet 's newsgroups are still propagated with UUCP between servers , UUCP as a mail transport has virtually disappeared along with the " bang paths " it used as message routing headers .
Sendmail , released with 4.1cBSD , right after RFC 788 , was one of the first mail transfer agents to implement SMTP .
Over time , as BSD Unix became the most popular operating system on the Internet , sendmail became the most common MTA ( mail transfer agent ) .
Some other popular SMTP server programs include Postfix , qmail , Novell GroupWise , Exim , Novell NetMail , Microsoft Exchange Server , Sun Java System Messaging Server .

Some psychologists argue that only the " higher " intellectual functions constitute mind , particularly reason and memory .
In this view the emotions - love , hate , fear , joy - are more " primitive " or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such .
Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated , that they are of the same nature and origin , and should therefore be considered all part of what we call the mind .
One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access .

Sociology , for Max Weber , is : Weber was concerned with the question of objectivity and subjectivity .
Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means , but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding ( that of the scientist ) .
Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool @-@ proof , universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited .
Therefore , Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future .

Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the welfare state , corporate capitalism and mass consumption .
In consequence , boundaries between public and private , the individual and society , the system and the lifeworld are deteriorating .
Michael Schudson from the University of California , San Diego argues more generally that a public sphere as a place of purely rational independent debate never existed .
Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview .

For example , a model airplane of 1 kg , traveling due north at 1 m / s in straight and level flight , has a momentum of 1 kg m / s due north measured from the ground .
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once .
In quantum mechanics , position and momentum are conjugate variables .
This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator , though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms .
This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles , but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules .
When the propagation speed of these electromagnetic waves was calculated , the speed of light fell out .
However , the nature of these essential chemical elements remained unknown .
This problem was solved by Amedeo Avogadro , who studied the reacting volumes of gases as they formed liquids and solids .
The success of the periodic table effectively converted any remaining opposition to atomic theory ; even though no single atom had ever been observed in the laboratory , chemistry was now an atomic science .
More importantly , the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell .
Furthermore , classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete .
It had been long known that thermal objects emit light .
This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe .
The more light there is , the more electrons are ejected .
If one used Planck 's energy quanta , and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum hν , then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply .
Low @-@ frequency light only ejects low @-@ energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon .
When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 , it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity , but for the simple , yet totally revolutionary , suggestion of quantized light .
That is , Newton proposed that light consisted of small particles , with which he could easily explain the phenomenon of reflection .
= = = Young , Fresnel , and Maxwell = = = In the early 19th century , the double @-@ slit experiments by Young and Fresnel provided evidence for Huygens ' wave theories .
In the late 19th century , James Clerk Maxwell explained light as the propagation of electromagnetic waves according to the Maxwell equations .
These equations were verified by experiment by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 , and the wave theory became widely accepted .
= = = Planck 's formula for black @-@ body radiation = = = In 1901 , Max Planck published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object .
It was Einstein who later proposed that it is the electromagnetic radiation itself that is quantized , and not the energy of radiating atoms .
According to the classical theory of light and matter , the strength or amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness : a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current .
Yet , oddly , this was not so .
For example , photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal , but photons of red light did not .
At Bell Labs Clinton Joseph Davisson and Lester Halbert Germer guided their beam through a crystalline grid .

Among the most famous experiments are those of Estermann and Otto Stern in 1929 .
In 1999 , the diffraction of C60 fullerenes by researchers from the University of Vienna was reported .
Fullerenes are comparatively large and massive objects , having an atomic mass of about 720 u .
The de Broglie wavelength is 2.5 pm , whereas the diameter of the molecule is about 1 nm , about 400 times larger .
In the formalism of the theory , all the information about a particle is encoded in its " wave function , " a complex @-@ valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space .
For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the form of the wave equation .

Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge .
In addition , electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves .
Electricity occurs due to several types of physics : * electric charge : a property of some subatomic particles , which determines their electromagnetic interactions .
* electric field ( see electrostatics ) : an especially simple type of electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge even when it is not moving ( i.e. , there is no electric current ) .
The electric field produces a force on other charges in its vicinity .
* electric potential : the capacity of an electric field to do work on an electric charge , typically measured in volts .
* electric current : a movement or flow of electrically charged particles , typically measured in amperes .
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects , such as rods of amber , could be rubbed with cat 's fur to attract light objects like feathers .
Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect , but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity .

At its height , the Ottoman Empire spanned from Hungary in the north to Somalia in the south , and from Algeria in the west to Iran in the east .
Suleiman I , who ruled the empire when it was at its zenith in the 16th century , had a reign of 46 years , the longest in Ottoman history .
This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son , but usually by an uncle or brother .

The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick , being slightly less opaque than air on Earth .
In 1868 , Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed " helium , " after the Greek Sun god Helios .
Twenty @-@ five years later , helium was isolated on Earth .
The chromosphere , transition region , and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun .
The reason is not well understood , but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona .
The transition region does not occur at a well @-@ defined altitude .
Rather , it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments , and is in constant , chaotic motion .
Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within , because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves .
The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere , forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape , until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun .
At a typical solar minimum , few sunspots are visible , and occasionally none can be seen at all .
This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age , when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures .
A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years .
These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles .
In addition , Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona .
= = = Faint young Sun problem = = = Theoretical models of the Sun 's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago , during the Archean period , the Sun was only about 75 % as bright as it is today .
Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on Earth 's surface , and thus life should not have been able to develop .
However , the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history , and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today .
In many prehistoric and ancient cultures , the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural phenomenon .
The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot , Galileo Galilei and other astronomers .
In 1672 Giovanni Cassini and Jean Richer determined the distance to Mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the Sun .
In the early years of the modern scientific era , the source of the Sun 's energy was a significant puzzle .
Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun was a gradually cooling liquid body that was radiating an internal store of heat .
In 1890 Joseph Lockyer , who discovered helium in the solar spectrum , proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun .
Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered .
Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun 's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat , and suggested radioactive decay as the source .
The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe .

The styling of the A1 was by Tom Karen of Ogle Design .
The design essentially remained this way until April 1972 .
In 1971 a special model of the A1 was developed in dedication to the Mediterranean Games in İzmir , called the " Akdeniz " ( Mediterranean ) .
Starting from 1972 , this model became the standard coupé of Anadol until its production was stopped in 1975 .
The Anadol was originally only available as a coupé , but in late 1973 was joined by a saloon ( sedan ) and an estate version .
Anadol A1 was also the first Turkish rally car , and " Anadol Ralli Takımı ( ART ) " became the first Turkish rally team .
Famous rally driver Romolo Marcopoli was also an A1 fan .

He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 , and through this organisation , he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force .
Gandhi 's ideas took shape , and the concept of " Satyagraha " matured during this struggle .
Under his leadership , the Congress was reorganised with a new constitution , with the goal of " Swaraj . "
Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women , rich or poor , to spend time each day spinning " khadi " in support of the independence movement .
Yet , just as the movement reached its apex , it ended abruptly as a result of a violent clash in the town of Chauri Chaura , Uttar Pradesh , in February 1922 .
Gandhi attempted to bridge these differences through many means , including a three @-@ week fast in the autumn of 1924 , but with limited success .
Gandhi had not only moderated the views of younger men like Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru , who sought a demand for immediate independence , but also reduced his own call to a one @-@ year wait , instead of two .

In humans , for example , eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the " brown @-@ eye trait " from one of their parents .
The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype .
Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA , a molecule that encodes genetic information .
DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases .
The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information , in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence .
Before a cell divides , the DNA is copied , so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence .
Within cells , the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes .
The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus .
DNA sequences can change through mutations , producing new alleles .
If a mutation occurs within a gene , the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls , altering the phenotype of the organism .
However , while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases , most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci ( multiple interacting genes ) .
Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA .
These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems .
Heritability may also occur at even larger scales .
A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes .
The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation .
Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population .
Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics , one common hypothesis was blending inheritance .
Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow , most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species .
= = = Mutation = = = Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell 's genome .
For example , the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for colour vision and one for night vision ; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene .
New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function .
The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated , with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions .
Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution .
= = = Gene flow = = = Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species .
It can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species .
Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer .
In medicine , this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance , as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species .
Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast " Saccharomyces cerevisiae " and the adzuki bean weevil " Callosobruchus chinensis " has occurred .
Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms , allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains .
It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea .
The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism .
If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene , then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population .
" Importantly , the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic ; if the environment changes , previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful .
However , even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way , traits that were lost in the past may not re @-@ evolve in an identical form ( see Dollo 's law ) .
A special case of natural selection is sexual selection , which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates .
Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits , are more or less likely to survive .
" Nature " in this sense refers to an ecosystem , that is , a system in which organisms interact with every other element , physical as well as biological , in their local environment .
" Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche , or position , with distinct relationships to other parts of the system .
These relationships involve the life history of the organism , its position in the food chain and its geographic range .
This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which , together , comprise natural selection .
Natural selection can act at different levels of organisation , such as genes , cells , individual organisms , groups of organisms and species .
For example , according to the phenotype @-@ first theory of evolution , mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment .
Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new , fully functional gene .
But when selection is weak , mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution .
This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias , and / or because the function had a cost , and once the benefit of the function disappeared , natural selection leads to the loss .
However , the rate of recombination is low ( approximately two events per chromosome per generation ) .
A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype .
= = = Gene flow = = = Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species .
The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution .
During the development of the modern synthesis , Sewall Wright developed his shifting balance theory , which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution .
Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection .
In general , macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution .
Thus , the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one - the difference is simply the time involved .
However , in macroevolution , the traits of the entire species may be important .
For example , the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes , which form about half the world 's biomass despite their small size , and constitute the vast majority of Earth 's biodiversity .
= = = Adaptation = = = Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat .
Also , the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism 's survival .
Consequently , structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms .
This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways .
During evolution , some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures .
Such structures may have little or no function in a current species , yet have a clear function in ancestral species , or other closely related species .
However , many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations : structures originally adapted for one function , but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process .
An area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations .
This research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features .
These studies have shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures , such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals .
It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes .
For instance , an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil .
This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis .
Here , the fungi actually grow inside plant cells , allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts , while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system .
On an even smaller scale , the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism , which then supports a small number of the animal 's germ cells to produce offspring .
There are multiple ways to define the concept of " species .
Despite the diversity of various species concepts , these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches : interbreeding , ecological and phylogenetic .
The Biological Species Concept ( BSC ) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach .
Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942 , the BSC states that " species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations , which are reproductively isolated from other such groups .
Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species , while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species .
Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations .
Speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature .
Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms .
The third mechanism of speciation is parapatric speciation .
This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat , but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations .
Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species ' habitat .
This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile .
An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species " Arabidopsis thaliana " and " Arabidopsis arenosa " cross @-@ bred to give the new species " Arabidopsis suecica . "
This happened about 20,000 years ago , and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory , which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process .
Indeed , chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation , as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms .
= = = Extinction = = = Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species .
Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct , and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species .
Present @-@ day extinction rates are 100 @-@ 1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 % of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century .
The role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered .
Current species are a stage in the process of evolution , with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events .
For example , all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids .
The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6 @-@ 2.7 billion years ago .
Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms , a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years , in an event called the Cambrian explosion .
Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species .
Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms .
This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals .
Understanding the changes that have occurred during an organism 's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body , genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders .
In computer science , simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection .
Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s .
He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems .
Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland .
Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi @-@ dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems .
Today , the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists .

Solaris is a Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems .
Oracle Solaris , as it is now known , has been owned by Oracle Corporation since Oracle 's acquisition of Sun in January 2010 .
Solaris is known for its scalability , especially on SPARC systems , and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace , ZFS and Time Slider .
Historically , Solaris was developed as proprietary software .
In June 2005 , Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license , and founded the OpenSolaris open source project .
With OpenSolaris , Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software .
After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010 , Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model .
In August 2010 , Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris Kernel , effectively turning Solaris 11 into a closed source proprietary operating system .
However , through the Oracle Technology Network ( OTN ) , industry partners can still gain access to the in @-@ development Solaris source code .
Source code for the open source components of Solaris 11 is available for download from Oracle .
On September 4 , 1991 , Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD @-@ derived Unix , SunOS 4 , with one based on SVR4 .
The justification for this new " overbrand " was that it encompassed not only SunOS , but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing ( ONC ) functionality .
For example , Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4 .
= = Supported architectures = = Solaris uses a common code base for the platforms it supports : SPARC and i86pc ( which includes both x86 and x86 @-@ 64 ) .
Solaris has a reputation for being well @-@ suited to symmetric multiprocessing , supporting a large number of CPUs .
It has historically been tightly integrated with Sun 's SPARC hardware ( including support for 64 @-@ bit SPARC applications since Solaris 7 ) , with which it is marketed as a combined package .
This has led to more reliable systems , but at a cost premium compared to commodity PC hardware .
= = = Other platforms = = = Solaris 2.5.1 included support for the PowerPC platform ( PowerPC Reference Platform ) , but the port was canceled before the Solaris 2.6 release .
In January 2006 a community of developers at Blastwave began work on a PowerPC port which they named " Polaris . "
A port of Solaris to the Intel Itanium architecture was announced in 1997 but never brought to market .
On October 17 , 2008 a prototype release of Sirius was made available and on November 19 the same year , IBM authorized the use of Sirius on System z IFL processors .
Solaris also supports the Linux platform ABI , allowing Solaris to run native Linux binaries on x86 systems .
This feature is called " Solaris Containers for Linux Applications " or SCLA , based on the branded zones functionality introduced in Solaris 10 8 / 07 .
Installation of Solaris is not necessary for an individual to use the system .
In Solaris 2.0 to 2.2 , OpenWindows supported both NeWS and X applications , and provided backward compatibility for SunView applications from Sun 's older desktop environment .
NeWS allowed applications to be built in an object oriented way using PostScript , a common printing language released in 1982 .
Sun later dropped support for legacy SunView applications and NeWS with OpenWindows 3.3 , which shipped with Solaris 2.3 , and switched to X11R5 with Display Postscript support .
The graphical look and feel remained based upon OPEN LOOK .
OpenWindows 3.6.2 was the last release under Solaris 8 .
The OPEN LOOK Virtual Window Manager ( olvwm ) can still be downloaded for Solaris from sunfreeware and works on releases as recent as Solaris 10 .
Sun and other Unix vendors created an industry alliance to standardize Unix desktops .
CDE was an initiative to create a standard Unix desktop environment .
CDE was available as an unbundled add @-@ on for Solaris 2.4 and 2.5 , and was included in Solaris 2.6 through 10 .
In 2001 , Sun issued a preview release of the open @-@ source desktop environment GNOME 1.4 , based on the GTK + toolkit , for Solaris 8 .
Solaris 9 8 / 03 introduced GNOME 2.0 as an alternative to CDE .
Solaris 10 includes Sun 's Java Desktop System ( JDS ) , which is based on GNOME and comes with a large set of applications , including StarOffice , Sun 's office suite .
Sun describes JDS as a " major component " of Solaris 10 .
The Java Desktop System is not included in Solaris 11 which instead ships with a stock version of GNOME .
Likewise , CDE applications are no longer included in Solaris 11 , but many libraries remain for binary backwards compatibility .
The open source desktop environments KDE and Xfce , along with numerous other window managers , also compile and run on recent versions of Solaris .
Sun was investing in a new desktop environment called Project Looking Glass since 2003 .
The project has been inactive since late 2006 .
The license allowed the user to download the operating system free of charge , through the Oracle Technology Network , and use it for a 90 @-@ day trial period .
After that trial period had expired the user would then have to purchase a support contract from Oracle to continue using the operating system .
With the release of Solaris 11 in 2011 the license terms changed again .
On 5 December 1936 , the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was established as a full republic of the Soviet Union .
During the 1920s , Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural , educational and social life .
Economic and social development also was notable .
However , the Republic 's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication , " Literaturny Kirghizstan , " by the Union of Writers .
Unofficial political groups were forbidden , but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function .
In December 1990 , the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic 's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan .
In February 1991 , the name of the capital , Frunze , was changed back to its pre @-@ revolutionary name of Bishkek .
After the coup collapsed the following week , Akayev and Vice President German Kuznetsov announced their resignations from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) , and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned .
This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the Republic of Kyrgyzstan .
Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month , he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community .
Finally , on 21 December 1991 , Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new Commonwealth of Independent States .
In 1992 , Kyrgyzstan joined the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) .

General relativity , also known as the general theory of relativity , is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics .
Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity , it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data .
In addition , general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe .
= = History = = Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905 , Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework .
After numerous detours and false starts , his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations .
The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve .
But as early as 1916 , the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non @-@ trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations , the so @-@ called Schwarzschild metric .
By 1929 , however , the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding .
The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time : in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics , objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed .
However , there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play .
This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion , namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity .
However , space " time " as a whole is more complicated .
In the language of symmetry : where gravity can be neglected , physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics .
With Lorentz symmetry , additional structures come into play .
They are defined by the set of light cones ( see the image on the left ) .
As in the Newtonian case , this is suggestive of a more general geometry .
= = = Definition and basic properties = = = General relativity is a metric theory of gravitation .
Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler , spacetime tells matter how to move ; matter tells spacetime how to curve .
For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light , the theory 's predictions converge on those of Newton 's law of universal gravitation .
It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity , namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers .
Einstein 's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and , as such , difficult to solve exactly .
Nevertheless , a number of exact solutions are known , although only a few have direct physical applications .
In the field of numerical relativity , powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein 's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes .
The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light .
The expansion involves a series of terms ; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity , whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton 's theory due to general relativity .
= = Consequences of Einstein 's theory = = General relativity has a number of physical consequences .
Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted , whereas light sent in the opposite direction ( i.e. , climbing out of the gravity well ) is redshifted ; collectively , these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift .
More generally , processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away ; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation .
All results are in agreement with general relativity .
However , at the current level of accuracy , these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid .
This and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light @-@ like or null geodesic - a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics .
As one examines suitable model spacetimes ( either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or , for more than a single mass , the post @-@ Newtonian expansion ) , several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge .
Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle .
The effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric ( describing spacetime around a spherical mass ) or the much more general post @-@ Newtonian formalism .
Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars , the effect is too small to be observable .
Because neutron stars are very compact , significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation .
The first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor , using the binary pulsar PSR1913 + 16 they had discovered in 1974 .
If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances , the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target .
Such effects are known as gravitational lensing .
The earliest example was discovered in 1979 ; since then , more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed .
Several land @-@ based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation , most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600 , LIGO ( two detectors ) , TAMA 300 and VIRGO .
In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution , neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses , and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses , are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars .
General relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena , and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory .
Astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated , although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part .
Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario .
An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe , prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity .
Since no object can overtake a light pulse , all interior matter is imprisoned as well .
Using global geometry , later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes .
Even more remarkably , there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics , which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics .
For instance , by the second law of black hole mechanics , the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time , analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system .
This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole ( e.g.
There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are , in fact , a subset of the laws of thermodynamics , and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy .
This radiation is known as Hawking radiation ( cf .
There are other types of horizons .
Even in flat Minkowski space , when described by an accelerated observer ( Rindler space ) , there will be horizons associated with a semi @-@ classical radiation known as Unruh radiation .
The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities ( no perfect symmetries , matter with realistic properties ) are safely hidden away behind a horizon , and thus invisible to all distant observers .
The best @-@ known example is the ADM formalism .
In Einstein 's theory , it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system 's total mass ( or energy ) .
The main reason is that the gravitational field - like any physical field - must be ascribed a certain energy , but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy .
Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum .
The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems , such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture .
= = Relationship with quantum theory = = If general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics , then quantum theory , the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics , would be the other .
However , how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question .
In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence ( quantum ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quantization itself , physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime .
These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime , and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime .
As briefly mentioned above , this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes .
At low energies , this approach proves successful , in that it results in an acceptable effective ( quantum ) field theory of gravity .
Another approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory .
All candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome .
= = Current status = = General relativity has emerged as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology , which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests .
However , there are strong indications the theory is incomplete .
Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics .
Mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein 's equations , and increasingly powerful computer simulations ( such as those describing merging black holes ) are run .

On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled " First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . "
Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high @-@ speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer .
Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 4 MHz were very common at this time , limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with .
The first such improvement came with the advent of the transistor .
At first only very basic non @-@ specialized digital circuits such as NOR gates were miniaturized into ICs .
MSI and LSI ( medium- and large @-@ scale integration ) ICs increased transistor counts to hundreds , and then thousands .
In 1964 , IBM introduced its System / 360 computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speed and performance .
This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another , even those made by the same manufacturer .
In the same year ( 1964 ) , Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets , the PDP @-@ 8 .
DEC would later introduce the extremely popular PDP @-@ 11 line that originally was built with SSI ICs but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became practical .
Additionally while discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage , new high @-@ performance designs like SIMD ( Single Instruction Multiple Data ) vector processors began to appear .
Microprocessors , on the other hand , are CPUs manufactured on a very small number of ICs ; usually just one .
While the complexity , size , construction , and general form of CPUs have changed enormously since 1950 , it is notable that the basic design and function has not changed much at all .
The way in which the numerical instruction value is interpreted is defined by the CPU 's instruction set architecture ( ISA ) .
Such operands may be given as a constant value ( called an immediate value ) , or as a place to locate a value : a register or a memory address , as determined by some addressing mode .
The control unit does not execute program instructions ; rather , it directs other parts of the system to do so .
Related to numeric representation is the size and precision of integer numbers that a CPU can represent .
This has the advantage of simplifying the CPU significantly , both from a design perspective and a component @-@ count perspective .
For example , a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal .
Higher clock rates in increasingly complex CPUs make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase ( synchronized ) throughout the entire unit .
In general , a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static state .
Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether .
Two notable examples of this are the ARM compliant AMULET and the MIPS R3000 compatible MiniMIPS .

The U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) developed the system , which originally used 24 satellites .
Announcements from Vice President Al Gore and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes .
Two American physicists , William Guier and George Weiffenbach , at Johns Hopkins 's Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) , decided to monitor Sputnik 's radio transmissions .
Within hours they realized that , because of the Doppler effect , they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit .
The Director of the APL gave them access to their UNIVAC to do the heavy calculations required .
The next spring , Frank McClure , the deputy director of the APL , asked Guier and Weiffenbach to investigate the inverse problem - pinpointing the user 's location given that of the satellite .
) This led them and APL to develop the Transit system .
In 1959 , ARPA ( renamed DARPA in 1972 ) also played a role in Transit .
The first satellite navigation system , Transit , used by the United States Navy , was first successfully tested in 1960 .
It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour .
In 1967 , the U.S. Navy developed the Timation satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space , a technology required by GPS .
In the 1970s , the ground @-@ based Omega Navigation System , based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations , became the first worldwide radio navigation system .
Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy .
This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded .
Considered vital to the nuclear @-@ deterrence posture , accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a force multiplier .
The USAF , with two thirds of the nuclear triad , also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system .
In 1960 , the Air Force proposed a radio @-@ navigation system called MOSAIC ( MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control ) that was essentially a 3 @-@ D LORAN .
In 1964 , the United States Army orbited its first Sequential Collation of Range ( SECOR ) satellite used for geodetic surveying .
GPS can be thought of as an evolution of the SECOR system where the ground @-@ based transmitters have been migrated into orbit .
It was at this meeting that " the real synthesis that became GPS was created .
The first satellite was launched in 1989 , and the 24th satellite was launched in 1994 .
Roger L. Easton is widely credited as the primary inventor of GPS .
Initially , the highest quality signal was reserved for military use , and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded ( Selective Availability ) .
GPS is owned and operated by the United States Government as a national resource .
The Department of Defense is the steward of GPS .
Its membership includes equivalent @-@ level officials from the departments of state , commerce , and homeland security , the joint chiefs of staff , and NASA .
* In 1978 , the first experimental Block @-@ I GPS satellite was launched .
* On February 14 , 1989 , the first modern Block @-@ II satellite was launched .
* The Gulf War from 1990 to 1991 was the first conflict in which the military widely used GPS .
* Full Operational Capability ( FOC ) was declared by Air Force Space Command ( AFSPC ) in April 1995 , signifying full availability of the military 's secure Precise Positioning Service ( PPS ) .
* In 2004 , the United States Government signed an agreement with the European Community establishing cooperation related to GPS and Europe 's planned Galileo system .
* In 2004 , United States President George W. Bush updated the national policy and replaced the executive board with the National Executive Committee for Space @-@ Based Positioning , Navigation , and Timing .
* November 2004 , Qualcomm announced successful tests of assisted GPS for mobile phones .
* In 2005 , the first modernized GPS satellite was launched and began transmitting a second civilian signal ( L2C ) for enhanced user performance .
* On May 19 , 2009 , the United States Government Accountability Office issued a report warning that some GPS satellites could fail as soon as 2010 .
More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a compass or an inertial navigation system to complement GPS .
Applications for GPS such as time transfer , traffic signal timing , and synchronization of cell phone base stations , make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing .
Although four satellites are required for normal operation , fewer apply in special cases .
If one variable is already known , a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites .
For example , a ship or aircraft may have known elevation .
These are the space segment ( SS ) , a control segment ( CS ) , and a user segment ( US ) .
The U.S. Air Force develops , maintains , and operates the space and control segments .
GPS satellites broadcast signals from space , and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate its three @-@ dimensional location ( latitude , longitude , and altitude ) and the current time .
The space segment is composed of 24 to 32 satellites in medium earth orbit and also includes the payload adapters to the boosters required to launch them into orbit .
The control segment is composed of a master control station ( MCS ) , an alternate master control station , and a host of dedicated and shared ground antennas and monitor stations .
, there are 32 satellites in the GPS constellation .
= = Applications = = While originally a military project , GPS is considered a " dual @-@ use " technology , meaning it has significant military and civilian applications .
GPS has become a widely deployed and useful tool for commerce , scientific uses , tracking , and surveillance .
= = = Civilian = = = Many civilian applications use one or more of GPS 's three basic components : absolute location , relative movement , and time transfer .
* Astronomy : both positional and clock synchronization data is used in astrometry and celestial mechanics calculations .
* Clock synchronization : the accuracy of GPS time signals ( ± 10 ns ) is second only to the atomic clocks they are based on .
* Disaster relief / emergency services : depend upon GPS for location and timing capabilities .
* Geofencing : vehicle tracking systems , person tracking systems , and pet tracking systems use GPS to locate a vehicle , person , or pet .
* GPS tours : location determines what content to display ; for instance , information about an approaching point of interest .
* Phasor measurements : GPS enables highly accurate timestamping of power system measurements , making it possible to compute phasors .
* Robotics : self @-@ navigating , autonomous robots using a GPS sensors , which calculate latitude , longitude , time , speed , and heading .
* Sport : used in football and rugby for the control and analysis of the training load .
* Surveying : surveyors use absolute locations to make maps and determine property boundaries .
This rule applies even to otherwise purely civilian units that only receive the L1 frequency and the C / A ( Coarse / Acquisition ) code .
This has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach .
* Search and rescue : Downed pilots can be located faster if their position is known .
* Reconnaissance : Patrol movement can be managed more closely .
= = Communication = = The navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions , the state of the internal clocks , and the health of the network .
These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network .
Two different encodings are used : a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation , and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military .
Each complete message takes 750 seconds ( 12 1 / 2 minutes ) to complete .
The message structure has a basic format of a 1500 @-@ bit @-@ long frame made up of five subframes , each subframe being 300 bits ( 6 seconds ) long .
Subframes 4 and 5 are subcommutated 25 times each , so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames .
Each subframe consists of ten words , each 30 bits long .
Thus , with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message , each message is 37,500 bits long .
At a transmission rate of 50 @-@ bit / s , this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire almanac message ( GPS ) .
Each 30 @-@ second frame begins precisely on the minute or half @-@ minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite .
The first subframe of each frame encodes the week number and the time within the week , as well as the data about the health of the satellite .
To collect all transmitted almanacs , the receiver must demodulate the message for 732 to 750 seconds or 12 1 / 2 minutes .
The ephemeris is updated every 2 hours and is generally valid for 4 hours , with provisions for updates every 6 hours or longer in non @-@ nominal conditions .
The almanac is updated typically every 24 hours .
= = = Satellite frequencies = = = All satellites broadcast at the same two frequencies , 1.57542 GHz ( L1 signal ) and 1.2276 GHz ( L2 signal ) .
The receiver must be aware of the PRN codes for each satellite to reconstruct the actual message data .
The C / A code , for civilian use , transmits data at 1.023 million chips per second , whereas the P code , for U.S. military use , transmits at 10.23 million chips per second .
The actual internal reference of the satellites is 10.22999999543 MHz to compensate for relativistic effects that make observers on th earth perceive a different time reference with respect to the transmitters in orbit .
The L1 carrier is modulated by both the C / A and P codes , while the L2 carrier is only modulated by the P code .

Since the rise of experimental psychology in the 19th Century , psychology 's understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques .
Perceptual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound , smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver .
There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing , analogous to science , or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary .
The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable , even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying .
Human and animal brains are structured in a modular way , with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information .
For instance , taste is strongly influenced by smell .
Psychologist Jerome Bruner has developed a model of perception .
# At this stage , the cues become less open and selective .
According to Alan Saks and Gary Johns , there are three components to perception .
An example is the constitution of the United States of America .

This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs .
For the majority of ( small ) objects , the diameter is estimated by assuming an albedo .
Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting , welding , and space exploration .
After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent , it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons .
Before them , in 1784 , the English chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than nitrogen .
A century later , in 1895 , Lord Rayleigh discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions .
With this discovery , they realized an entire class of gases was missing from the periodic table .
During his search for argon , Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating cleveite , a mineral .
Ramsay continued to search for these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components .
In 1895 , French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine , the most electronegative element , and argon , one of the noble gases , but failed .
Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century , but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure .
In 1962 , Neil Bartlett discovered the first chemical compound of a noble gas , xenon hexafluoroplatinate .
Compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after : in 1962 for radon , radon difluoride , and in 1963 for krypton , krypton difluoride ( ) .
Radon has no stable isotopes ; its longest @-@ lived isotope , 222Rn , has a half @-@ life of 3.8 days and decays to form helium and polonium , which ultimately decays to lead .
Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions ; that is , they have a negative electron affinity .
The noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard conditions , but their deviations from the ideal gas law provided important clues for the study of intermolecular interactions .
= = Chemical properties = = The noble gases are colorless , odorless , tasteless , and nonflammable under standard conditions .
= = = Configuration = = = Like other groups , the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration , especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior : The noble gases have full valence electron shells .
However , heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium , making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases .
To do this , the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first , and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward .
= = = Compounds = = = The noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity ; consequently , only a few hundred noble gas compounds have been formed .
Compounds of xenon bound to boron , hydrogen , bromine , iodine , beryllium , sulphur , titanium , copper , and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices , or in supersonic noble gas jets .
However , due to the high radioactivity and short half @-@ life of radon isotopes , only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice .
Krypton difluoride is the most notable and easily characterized .
Krypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals ( hydrogen , chlorine , carbon ) as well as some late transition metals ( copper , silver , gold ) have also been observed , but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices , or in supersonic noble gas jets .
Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000 , such as argon fluorohydride ( HArF ) , and some bound to the late transition metals copper , silver , and gold .
The simplest is the helium hydride molecular ion , HeH + , discovered in 1925 .
Because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe , hydrogen and helium , it is believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium , although it has not been detected yet .
In addition to these ions , there are many known neutral excimers of the noble gases .
The essential condition for their formation is that the guest ( noble gas ) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice .
As of 2008 , endohedral complexes with helium , neon , argon , krypton , and xenon have been obtained .
These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom .
Noble gas compounds such as xenon difluoride ( ) are considered to be hypervalent because they violate the octet rule .
For example , bonding in is described by a set of three molecular orbitals ( MOs ) derived from p @-@ orbitals on each atom .
Helium is the most common element in the universe after hydrogen , with a mass fraction of about 24 % .
The reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere ; due to the small mass of the atom , helium cannot be retained by the Earth 's gravitational field .
Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth 's crust , and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits .
Due to its high radioactivity , radon presents a significant health hazard ; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone .
As an example , the table to the right lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas .
Liquid neon , although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium , also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40 times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen .
Helium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen , due its low solubility in fluids , especially in lipids .
Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving , which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis .
Another noble gas , argon , is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving .
Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography , as a filler gas for thermometers , and in devices for measuring radiation , such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber .
Argon , mixed with nitrogen , is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs .
The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2 , Kr2 or Xe2 , or more commonly , the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF , KrF , XeF , or XeCl .
These lasers produce ultraviolet light which , due to its short wavelength ( 193 nm for ArF and 248 nm for KrF ) , allows for high @-@ precision imaging .
They are used for microlithography and microfabrication , which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture , and for laser surgery , including laser angioplasty and eye surgery .
Some noble gases have direct application in medicine .
Helium is sometimes used to improve the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers .
Radon , which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts , is used in radiotherapy .

Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies for local area networks ( LANs ) and metropolitan area networks ( MANs ) .
In 1976 , after the system was deployed at PARC , Metcalfe and Boggs published a seminal paper .
Ethernet initially competed with two largely proprietary systems , Token Ring and Token Bus .
In the process , 3Com became a major company .
= = Standardization = = In February 1980 , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) started project 802 to standardize local area networks ( LAN ) .
The " DIX @-@ group " with Gary Robinson ( DEC ) , Phil Arst ( Intel ) , and Bob Printis ( Xerox ) submitted the so @-@ called " Blue Book " CSMA / CD specification as a candidate for the LAN specification .
In addition to CSMA / CD , Token Ring ( supported by IBM ) and Token Bus ( selected and henceforward supported by General Motors ) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard .
Delays in the standards process put at risk the market introduction of the Xerox Star workstation and 3Com 's Ethernet LAN products .
As early as March 1982 ECMA TC24 with its corporate members reached agreement on a standard for CSMA / CD based on the IEEE 802 draft .
This scheme was simpler than the competing token ring or token bus technologies .
Computers were connected to an Attachment Unit Interface ( AUI ) transceiver , which was in turn connected to the cable ( later with thin Ethernet the transceiver was integrated into the network adapter ) .
Since all communications happen on the same wire , any information sent by one computer is received by all , even if that information is intended for just one destination .
Every packet is sent to every port on the repeater , so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed .
The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link , and all links must operate at the same speed .
This created practical limits on how many machines could communicate on an Ethernet network .
Broadcast traffic is still forwarded to all network segments .
In 1989 , the networking company Kalpana introduced their EtherSwitch , the first Ethernet switch .

Descartes laid the foundation for 17th @-@ century continental rationalism , later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz , and opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes , Locke , Berkeley , and Hume .
Leibniz , Spinoza and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy , and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well .
When he was one year old , his mother Jeanne Brochard died .
Upon exiting he had formulated analytical geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy .
Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another , so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science .
Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in 1627 .
Cardinal Bérulle urged him to write an exposition of his own new philosophy .
The next year , under the name " Poitevin , " he enrolled at the Leiden University to study mathematics with Jacob Golius , who confronted him with Pappus 's hexagon theorem , and astronomy with Martin Hortensius .
In Amsterdam , he had a relationship with a servant girl , Helena Jans van der Strom , with whom he had a daughter , Francine , who was born in 1635 in Deventer , at which time Descartes taught at the Utrecht University .
Despite frequent moves he wrote all his major work during his 20 + years in the Netherlands , where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy .
A French translation of " Principia Philosophiæ , " prepared by Abbot Claude Picot , was published in 1647 .

" Jacob Bernoulli ( also known as James or Jacques ; - 16 August 1705 ) was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family .
= = Biography = = Jacob Bernoulli was born in Basel , Switzerland .
But contrary to the desires of his parents , he also studied mathematics and astronomy .
During this time he also produced an incorrect theory of comets .
Bernoulli returned to Switzerland and began teaching mechanics at the University in Basel from 1683 .
In 1684 he married Judith Stupanus ; and they had two children .
During this decade , he also began a fertile research career .
The two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in " Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis , itemque Tangentibus ... " published in " Acta Eruditorum . "
They also studied the publications of von Tschirnhaus .
Jacob collaborated with his brother on various applications of calculus .
By 1697 the relationship had completely broken down .
= = Important works = = Jacob Bernoulli 's first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685 , work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687 .
Bernoulli could not find a closed form for formula _ 2 , but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2 .
After finding the differential equation , Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables .
Jacob Bernoulli 's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus , since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning .
Jacob Bernoulli 's most original work was Ars Conjectandi published in Basel in 1713 , eight years after his death .
In the book Bernoulli reviewed work of others on probability , in particular work by van Schooten , Leibniz , and Prestet .

Christiaan Huygens , FRS ( or ; ) ( ) ( 14 April 1629 - 8 July 1695 ) was a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist .
He published major studies of mechanics and optics , and a pioneer work on games of chance .
= = Early life = = Christiaan Huygens was born on 14 April 1629 in The Hague , into a rich and influential Dutch family , the second son of Constantijn Huygens .
Constantijn Huygens was a diplomat and advisor to the House of Orange , and also a poet and musician .
Frans van Schooten was an academic at Leiden from 1646 , and also a private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother , replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes .
After two years , from March 1647 , Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded College of Orange , in Breda , where his father was a curator : the change occurred because of a duel between his brother Lodewijk and another student .
Christiaan Huygens lived at the home of the jurist Johann Henryk Dauber , and had mathematics classes with the English lecturer John Pell .
While his father had wished Christiaan to be a diplomat , it also was not to be .
In political terms , the First Stadtholderless Period that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was not in power , removing Constantijn Huygens 's influence .
While still a college student at Leiden he began a correspondence with the intelligencer Mersenne , who died quite soon afterwards in 1648 .
Mersenne had also written on musical theory .
In 1654 , Huygens returned to his father 's house in The Hague , and was able to devote himself entirely to research .
The family had another house , not far away at Hofwijck , and he spent time there during the summer .
Visiting Paris in 1655 , Huygens called on Ismael Boulliau to introduce himself .
He began grinding his own lenses in 1655 , collaborating with his brother Constantijn .
He designed in 1662 what is now called the Huygenian eyepiece , with two lenses , as a telescope ocular .
In 1662 Sir Robert Moray sent Huygens John Graunt 's life table , and in time Huygens and his brother Lodewijk worked on life expectancy .
On 3 May 1661 , Huygens observed the planet Mercury transit over the Sun , using the telescope of instrument maker Richard Reeve in London , together with astronomer Thomas Streete and Reeve .
Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of Jeremiah Horrocks on the transit of Venus , 1639 , which thereby was printed for the first time in 1662 .
In Paris Huygens had an important patron and correspondent in Jean @-@ Baptiste Colbert .
Denis Papin was assistant to Huygens from 1671 .
Papin moved to England in 1678 , and continued to work in this area .
In 1684 , he published " Astroscopia Compendiaria " on his new tubeless aerial telescope .
His father died in 1687 , and he inherited Hofwijck , which he made his home the following year .
On his third visit to England , in 1689 , Huygens met Isaac Newton on 12 June .
He died in The Hague on 8 July 1695 , and was buried in the Grote Kerk .
He refers to Ignace @-@ Gaston Pardies , whose manuscript on optics helped him on his wave theory .
The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to geometric optics .

Niels Henrik David Bohr ( ; 7 October 1885 - 18 November 1962 ) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory , for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 .
Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models , its underlying principles remain valid .
He conceived the principle of complementarity : that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties , like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles .
Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen , now known as the Niels Bohr Institute , which opened in 1920 .
Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers , Oskar Klein , George de Hevesy and Werner Heisenberg .
He predicted the existence of a new zirconium @-@ like element , which was named hafnium , after the Latin name for Copenhagen , where it was discovered .
From there , he was flown to Britain , where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project , and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project .
After the war , Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy .
He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission , and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957 .
He had an elder sister , Jenny , and a younger brother Harald .
Jenny became a teacher , while Harald became a mathematician and Olympic footballer who played for the Danish national team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London .
Niels was a passionate footballer as well , and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen @-@ based Akademisk Boldklub ( Academic Football Club ) , with Niels as goalkeeper .
His major was physics , which he studied under Professor Christian Christiansen , the university 's only professor of physics at that time .
He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor Thorvald Thiele , and philosophy under Professor Harald Høffding , a friend of his father .
Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father 's laboratory in the university ; the university itself had no physics laboratory .
He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the " Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society . "
He surveyed the literature on the subject , settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz , in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas .
Bohr extended Lorentz 's model , but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect , and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals .
The thesis was accepted in April 1911 , and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May .
Harald had received his doctorate the previous year .
In 1921 , the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr 's thesis that is today known as the Bohr @-@ van Leeuwen theorem .
In 1910 , Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund , the sister of the mathematician Niels Erik Nørlund .
Niels and Margrethe had six sons .
The oldest , Christian , died in a boating accident in 1934 , and another , Harald , died from childhood meningitis .
Aage Bohr became a successful physicist , and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics , like his father .
Hans Henrik became a physician ; Erik , a chemical engineer ; and Ernest , a lawyer .
Like his uncle Harald , Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete , playing field hockey for Denmark at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London .
At the time , it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done .
Bohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding , and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon .
Martin Knudsen put Bohr 's name forward for a " docent , " which was approved in July 1913 , and Bohr then began teaching medical students .
He adapted Rutherford 's nuclear structure to Max Planck 's quantum theory and so created his Bohr model of the atom .
Planetary models of atoms were not new , but Bohr 's treatment was .
This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory .
Balmer 's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines , but for thirty years , no one could explain why it worked .
When challenged on this by Alfred Fowler , Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium , helium atoms with only one electron .
Today , the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded , but is still the best known model of the atom , as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts .
He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen , which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler .
They stayed until July 1916 , by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen , a position created especially for him .
= = = Institute of Physics = = = In April 1917 , Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics .
He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation , and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors , many of them Jewish .
Now known as the Niels Bohr Institute , it opened its doors on 3 March 1921 with Bohr as its director .
His family moved into an apartment on the first floor .
Early arrivals included Hans Kramers from the Netherlands , Oskar Klein from Sweden , George de Hevesy from Hungary , Wojciech Rubinowicz from Poland and Svein Rosseland from Norway .
The Bohr model worked well for hydrogen , but could not explain more complex elements .
An important development came in 1924 with Wolfgang Pauli 's discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle , which put Bohr 's models on a firm theoretical footing .
At the Institute in Copenhagen , Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong .
In 1922 , Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics " for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them . "
This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers .
They led to the development of matrix mechanics , the first form of modern quantum mechanics .
The BKS theory also generated discussion of , and renewed attention to , difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory .
In the light of these results , Bohr informed Darwin , " there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible .
" = = = Quantum mechanics = = = The introduction of spin by George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit in November 1925 was a milestone .
When his train stopped in Hamburg , he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and Otto Stern , who asked for his opinion of the spin theory .
Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields .
When he arrived in Leiden , Paul Ehrenfest and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using relativity .
Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper .
Thus , when he met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan in Göttingen on the way back , he had become , in his own words , " a prophet of the electron magnet gospel . "
This work attracted the attention of the British physicist Paul Dirac , who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926 .
Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger also visited in 1926 .
He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity : that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties , such as being a wave or a stream of particles , depending on the experimental framework .
He felt that that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers .
In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle , which Bohr embraced .
In a paper he presented at the Volta Conference at Como in September 1927 , he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments , without quantum terminology or matrices .
Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed .
Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion .
Einstein and Bohr had good @-@ natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives .
Harald Høffding had been the first occupant , and upon his death in July 1931 , the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy .
He and his family moved there in 1932 .
He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939 .
This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the compound nucleus in 1936 , which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus .
In this model , the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid .
He worked on this with a new collaborator , the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar , who died suddenly in 1938 .
The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 ( and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner ) generated intense interest among physicists .
Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939 .
Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek , Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that " I have understood everything .
" Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus , Bohr concluded that it was the uranium @-@ 235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium @-@ 238 that was primarily responsible for fission .
In April 1940 , John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct .
In the meantime , Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on " The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission . "
Richard Rhodes argued in " The Making of the Atomic Bomb " that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding .
In 1909 , Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard 's " Stages on Life 's Way " as a birthday gift .
In the enclosed letter , Bohr wrote , " It is the only thing I have to send home ; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better ...
" Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard 's language and literary style , but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard 's philosophy .
In 1933 , the Rockefeller Foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics , and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation , Max Mason , in May 1933 during a visit to the United States .
In April 1940 , early in the Second World War , Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Denmark .
To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue 's and James Franck 's gold Nobel medals , Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia .
In September 1941 , Heisenberg , who had become head of the German nuclear energy project , visited Bohr in Copenhagen .
Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists , that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts , and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world 's scientists on both sides .
Michael Frayn 's 1998 play " Copenhagen " explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr .
The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September .
The next day , Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden 's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees .
On 2 October 1943 , Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum , and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter .
When the news of Bohr 's escape reached Britain , Lord Cherwell sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain .
Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation .
Bohr 's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later , and became his personal assistant .
Bohr was warmly received by James Chadwick and Sir John Anderson , but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight .
He was given an apartment at St James 's Palace and an office with the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons development team .
Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant , with Aage as his assistant .
On 8 December 1943 , Bohr arrived in Washington , D.C. , where he met with the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr .
He visited Einstein and Pauli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , and went to Los Alamos in New Mexico , where the nuclear weapons were being designed .
For security reasons , he went under the name of " Nicholas Baker " in the United States , while Aage became " James Baker . "
Bohr did not remain at Los Alamos , but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years .
Robert Oppenheimer credited Bohr with acting " as a scientific father figure to the younger men , " most notably Richard Feynman .
" Bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations .
In April 1944 , he received a letter from Peter Kapitza , written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden , inviting him to come to the Soviet Union .
In 1957 he received the first ever Atoms for Peace Award .
= = Later years = = With the war ended , Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945 , and was re @-@ elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September .
This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state , but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally , but Danish science .
Bohr designed his own coat of arms which featured a taijitu ( symbol of yin and yang ) and a motto in , " opposites are complementary . "
The Second World War demonstrated that science , and physics in particular , now required considerable financial and material resources .
Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site .
After a long debate , Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952 , and Geneva was chosen as the site in October .
The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957 .
The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough , however , if a man of his stature had not supported it .
" Meanwhile , Scandinavian countries formed the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957 , with Bohr as its chairman .
He was also involved with the founding of the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission , and served as its first chairman from February 1956 .
Bohr died of heart failure at his home in Carlsberg on 18 November 1962 .
On 7 October 1965 , on what would have been his 80th birthday , the Institute was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years : the Niels Bohr Institute .
In 1997 , the Danish National Bank began circulating the 500 @-@ krone banknote with the portrait of Bohr smoking a pipe .

The koala ( " Phascolarctos cinereus , " or , inaccurately , koala bear ) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia .
The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland 's eastern and southern regions , inhabiting Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia .
It is easily recognisable by its stout , tailless body ; round , fluffy ears ; and large , spoon @-@ shaped nose .
Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content , koalas are largely sedentary and sleep for up to 20 hours a day .
Koalas have few natural predators and parasites but are threatened by various pathogens , like Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus , as well as by bushfires and droughts .
Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814 , although his work remained unpublished for 180 years .
The Australian government lists populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable .
In 1819 , German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss gave it the binomial " Lipurus cinereus . "
French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest proposed the name " Phascolartos fuscus " in 1820 , suggesting that the brown @-@ coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones .
The koala is classified with wombats ( family Vombatidae ) and several extinct families ( including marsupial tapirs , marsupial lions and giant wombats ) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia .
The modern koala is the only extant member of Phascolarctidae , a family that once included several genera and species .
" Phascolarctos cinereus " may have emerged as a dwarf form of the giant koala ( " P. stirtoni " ) .
These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness , body size and skull shape .
The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three , with shorter , silver fur and a shorter skull .
Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation .
Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene .
Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations .
In April 2013 , scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome .
The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown .
The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short , muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities .
The koala 's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet , which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain .
For example , when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface , the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves .
Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin .
The koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt diet , which is of low nutritive value , of high toxicity and high in dietary fibre .
Since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet , its metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal , although this can vary between seasons and sexes .
The koala was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands , including Kangaroo Island and French Island .
The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range .
They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians .
In Queensland , koalas are unevenly distributed and uncommon except in the southeast , where they are numerous .
In New South Wales , they are abundant only in Pilliga , while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere .
They tend to choose species that have a high protein content and low proportions of fibre and lignin .
The most favoured species are " Eucalyptus microcorys , " " E. tereticornis , " and " E. camaldulensis , " which , on average , make up more than 20 percent of their diet .
Because they get so little energy from their diet , koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 hours a day ; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement .
They typically eat and sleep in the same tree , possibly for as long as a day .
= = = Social spacing = = = Koalas are asocial animals and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours .
In Victoria , home ranges are small and have extensive overlap , while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less .
The koala has one of the lowest milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mammal .
The female makes up for this by lactating for as long as 12 months .
At 26 weeks , the fully furred animal resembles an adult , and begins to poke its head out of the pouch .
Females become sexually mature at about three years of age and can then become pregnant ; in comparison , males reach sexual maturity when they are about four years old , although they can produce sperm as early as two years .
Eventually , the cusps will disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation .
These include the tapeworm " Bertiella obesa , " commonly found in the intestine , and the nematodes " Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus " and " Durikainema phascolarcti , " which are infrequently found in the lungs .
The koala retrovirus ( KoRV ) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome ( KIDS ) , which is similar to AIDS in humans .
Consequently , the koala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change .
= = Human relations = = = = = History = = = The first written reference of the koala was recorded by John Price , servant of John Hunter , the Governor of New South Wales .
Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes to Hunter 's successor , Philip Gidley King , who forwarded them to Joseph Banks .
Botanist Robert Brown was the first to write a detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814 , based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales .
Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal 's skull , throat , feet and paws .
Home , who in 1808 published his report in the journal " Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , " gave the animal the scientific name " Didelphis coola . "
Comparative anatomist Richard Owen , in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals , presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London .
English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse , curator of the Zoological Society of London , was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s .
Similarly , Gerard Krefft , curator of the Australian Museum , noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 " The Mammals of Australia . "
The first living koala in Britain arrived in 1881 , purchased by the Zoological Society of London .
Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , visited the Koala Park Sanctuary in Sydney in 1934 and was " intensely interested in the bears . "
His photograph , with Noel Burnet , the founder of the park , and a koala , appeared in the " Sydney Morning Herald . "
It benefited the Australian tourism industry by over an estimated billion dollars in 1998 , a figure that has since grown .
In one , a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy .
Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice .
The animal is also depicted in rock carvings , though not as much as some other species .
It is featured in Ethel Pedley 's 1899 book " Dot and the Kangaroo , " in which it is portrayed as the " funny native bear . "
This character also appeared as Bunyip Bluegum in Lindsay 's 1918 book " The Magic Pudding . "
Created by Dorothy Wall in 1933 , the character appeared in several books and has been the subject of films , TV series , merchandise and a 1986 environmental song by John Williamson .
The series has been ranked among the greatest commercials of all time .
A koala is the main character in Hanna @-@ Barbera 's " The Kwicky Koala Show " and Nippon Animation 's " Noozles , " both of which were animated cartoons of the early 1980s .
Food products shaped like the koala include the Caramello Koala chocolate bar and the bite @-@ sized cookie snack Koala 's March .
In 2012 , the Australian Government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable , because of a 40 % population decline in the former and a 33 % decline in the latter .
According to the customs of some tribes , it was considered taboo to skin the animal , while other tribes thought the animal 's head had a special status , and saved them for burial .
Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915 , 1917 , and again in 1919 , when over one million koalas were killed with guns , poisons and nooses .
The first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane 's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney 's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s .
In 1934 , David Fleay , curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo , established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo , and featured the koala .
Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park .
For example , in 1930 @-@ 31 , 165 koalas were translocated to Quail Island .
One of the biggest anthropogenic threats to the koala is habitat destruction and fragmentation .
Ant societies have division of labour , communication between individuals , and an ability to solve complex problems .
Some species , such as the red imported fire ant ( " Solenopsis invicta " ) , are regarded as invasive species , establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally .
In 1966 , E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant ( " Sphecomyrma " ) that lived in the Cretaceous period .
Some groups , such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae , are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil .
Ants occupy a wide range of ecological niches , and are able to exploit a wide range of food resources either as direct or indirect herbivores , predators , and scavengers .
Ants vary in colour ; most ants are red or black , but a few species are green and some tropical species have a metallic lustre .
Online databases of ant species , including AntBase and the Hymenoptera Name Server , help to keep track of the known and newly described species .

William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) - 23 April 1616 ) was an English : poet , : playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's pre @-@ eminent dramatist .
He is often called England 's national poet and the " Bard of Avon . "
Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon .
At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith .
Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 .
In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .
His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .
He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .
At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Anne Hathaway .
The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 .
Twins , son Hamnet and daughter Judith , followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585 .
Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596 .
= = = London and theatrical career = = = It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing , but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592 .
After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 , the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king , James I , and changed its name to the King 's Men .
In 1599 , a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames , which they called the Globe .
In 1608 , the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre .
In 1597 , he bought the second @-@ largest house in Stratford , New Place , and in 1605 , he invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford .
By 1598 , his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages .
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson 's " Works " names him on the cast lists for " Every Man in His Humour " ( 1598 ) and " Sejanus His Fall " ( 1603 ) .
Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career .
In 1596 , the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford , Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen 's , Bishopsgate , north of the River Thames .
He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599 , the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there .
By 1604 , he had moved north of the river again , to an area north of St Paul 's Cathedral with many fine houses .
There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy , a maker of ladies ' wigs and other headgear .
In 1612 , he was called as a witness in " Bellott v. Mountjoy , " a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy 's daughter , Mary .
In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory ; and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son @-@ in @-@ law , John Hall .
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him after 1613 .
His last three plays were collaborations , probably with John Fletcher , who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King 's Men .
Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 , at the age of 52 .
Susanna had married a physician , John Hall , in 1607 , and Judith had married Thomas Quiney , a vintner , two months before Shakespeare 's death .
In his will , Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna .
The Quineys had three children , all of whom died without marrying .
Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death .
Its plaque compares him to Nestor , Socrates , and Virgil .
Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world , including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets ' Corner in Westminster Abbey .
The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists , especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe , by the traditions of medieval drama , and by the plays of Seneca .
His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes , prose and poetry , and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work .
In this play , Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure .
His last major tragedies , " Antony and Cleopatra " and " Coriolanus , " contain some of Shakespeare 's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot .
Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare 's part , but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day .
Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays , " Henry VIII " and " The Two Noble Kinsmen , " probably with John Fletcher .
After the plagues of 1592 @-@ 3 , Shakespeare 's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch , north of the Thames .

= = History of the theory = = Originally electricity and magnetism were thought of as two separate forces .
# An electric current in a wire creates a circular magnetic field around the wire , its direction ( clockwise or counter @-@ clockwise ) depending on that of the current .
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved towards or away from a magnetic field , or a magnet is moved towards or away from it , the direction of current depending on that of the movement .
While preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820 , Hans Christian Ørsted made a surprising observation .
However , three months later he began more intensive investigations .
Soon thereafter he published his findings , proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire .
The CGS unit of magnetic induction ( oersted ) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism .
They influenced French physicist André @-@ Marie Ampère 's developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current @-@ carrying conductors .
Ørsted 's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy .
This unification , which was observed by Michael Faraday , extended by James Clerk Maxwell , and partially reformulated by Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich Hertz , is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics .
It had far @-@ reaching consequences , one of which was the understanding of the nature of light .
Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relation between electricity and magnetism .
In 1802 Gian Domenico Romagnosi , an Italian legal scholar , deflected a magnetic needle by electrostatic charges .
Actually , no galvanic current existed in the setup and hence no electromagnetism was present .
= = Fundamental forces = = The electromagnetic force is one of the four known fundamental forces .
All other forces ( e.g. , friction ) are ultimately derived from these fundamental forces and momentum carried by the movement of particles .
It also includes all forms of chemical phenomena .
The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves .
Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle , but the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Franklin 's proposed experiments in 1752 .
However , the effect did not become widely known until 1820 , when Ørsted performed a similar experiment .
Ørsted 's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation .
In classical electromagnetism , the electromagnetic field obeys a set of equations known as Maxwell 's equations , and the electromagnetic force is given by the Lorentz force law .
One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics , but it is compatible with special relativity .
After important contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré , in 1905 , Albert Einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity , which replaces classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics that is compatible with classical electromagnetism .
( For more information , see History of special relativity .
( For more information , see Classical electromagnetism and special relativity and Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism .
Both of these results were in direct contradiction with the classical view of light as a continuous wave .
This theory , completed in the 1940s @-@ 1950s , is known as quantum electrodynamics ( or " QED " ) , and , in situations where perturbation theory is applicable , is one of the most accurate theories known to physics .
Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field .
There are two types of electric charges : positive and negative .
The interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the electromagnetic force , which is one of the four fundamental forces ( See also : magnetic field ) .
Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles .
Robert Millikan 's oil @-@ drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly , and measured the elementary charge .
This charge is often small , because matter is made of atoms , and atoms typically have equal numbers of protons and electrons , in which case their charges cancel out , yielding a net charge of zero , thus making the atom neutral .
When the net electric charge of an object is non @-@ zero and motionless , the phenomenon is known as static electricity .
This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together , such as rubbing amber with fur or glass with silk .
Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material , leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind .
In such cases the object is said to be polarized .
The motion of electrons in conductive metals in a specific direction is known as electric current .
After finding the quantized character of charge , in 1891 George Stoney proposed the unit ' electron ' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge .
This was before the discovery of the particle by J.J. Thomson in 1897 .
In 1839 , Michael Faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity , current electricity , and bioelectricity was incorrect , and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities .
One of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was Benjamin Franklin , who argued in favour of a one @-@ fluid theory of electricity .
Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter ; for example , he believed that it was the glass in a Leyden jar that held the accumulated charge .
William Watson arrived at the same explanation at about the same time .
An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects .
In contrast , electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object , which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge .
* Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin .
It is now known that the Franklin / Watson model was fundamentally correct .
There is only one kind of electrical charge , and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge .
On the other hand , just knowing the charge is not a complete description of the situation .
Matter is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles , and these particles have many properties , not just charge .
The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current .
This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations .
Beware that , in the common and important case of metallic wires , the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the drift velocity of the actual charge carriers , i.e. , the electrons .
This means that any particle that has charge " Q , " no matter how fast it goes , always has charge " Q. "
= = Conservation of electric charge = = The total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself .
In early 1817 , Schober introduced Schubert to Johann Michael Vogl , a prominent baritone twenty years Schubert 's senior .
He is remembered today largely for his book " De Magnete " ( 1600 ) , and is credited as one of the originators of the term " electricity . "
He is regarded by some as the father of electrical engineering or electricity and magnetism .
While today he is generally referred to as William Gilbert , he also went under the name of William Gilberd .
He was educated at St John 's College , Cambridge .
In 1600 he was elected President of the College .
From 1601 until her death in 1603 , he was Elizabeth I 's own physician , and James VI and I renewed his appointment .
In this work , he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella .
In his book , he also studied static electricity using amber ; amber is called " elektron " in Greek , so Gilbert decided to call its effect the " electric force . "
Hans Christian Ørsted and James Clerk Maxwell showed that both effects were aspects of a single force : electromagnetism .
Maxwell surmised this in his " A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism " after much analysis .
According to Dr. John Davy , " this work of Gilbert 's , which is so little known , is a very remarkable one both in style and matter ; and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality .
The first was repeated in three of his works - " In the Advancement of Learning " ( 1605 ) , " Novum Organum " ( 1620 ) and " De Augmentis " ( 1623 ) .

In physics , moment is a combination of a physical quantity and a distance .
Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point or axis ; they deal with physical quantities as measured at some distance from that reference point or axis .
For example , a moment of force is the product of a force and its distance from an axis , which causes rotation about that axis .
at that point : : formula _ 1 , where formula _ 2 is the physical quantity such as a force applied at a point , or a point charge , or a point mass , etc .
If the quantity is not concentrated solely at a single point , the moment is the integral of that quantity 's density over space : : formula _ 3where formula _ 4 is the distribution of the density of charge , mass , or whatever quantity is being considered .
The technique can also be used to determine the properties of an unknown distribution formula _ 4 .
However , historical evolution of the term ' moment ' and its use in different branches of science , such as mathematics , physics and engineering , is unclear .
* Magnetic moment - formula _ 29 is a dipole moment measuring the strength and direction of a magnetic source .

The Real @-@ time Transport Protocol ( RTP ) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks .
RTP is used extensively in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media , such as telephony , video teleconference applications , television services and web @-@ based push @-@ to @-@ talk features .
RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol ( RTCP ) .
While RTP carries the media streams ( e.g. , audio and video ) , RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service ( QoS ) and aids synchronization of multiple streams .
RTP allows data transfer to multiple destinations through IP multicast .
Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP , although , , they are not in widespread use .
= = Profiles and payload formats = = One of the design considerations of RTP was to carry a range of multimedia formats ( such as H.264 , MPEG @-@ 4 , MJPEG , MPEG , etc .
The design of RTP is based on the architectural principle known as application level framing ( ALF ) .
The information required by a specific application 's needs is not included in the generic RTP header , but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats .
The " profile " defines the codecs used to encode the payload data and their mapping to payload format codes in the Payload Type ( PT ) field of the RTP header ( see below ) .
The audio payload formats include G.711 , G.723 , G.726 , G.729 , GSM , QCELP , MP3 , and DTMF , and the video payload formats include H.261 , H.263 , H.264 , and MPEG @-@ 4 .
* P ( Padding ) : ( 1 bit ) Used to indicate if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet .
* X ( Extension ) : ( 1 bit ) Indicates presence of an " Extension header " between standard header and payload data .
* CC ( CSRC Count ) : ( 4 bits ) Contains the number of CSRC identifiers ( defined below ) that follow the fixed header .
* M ( Marker ) : ( 1 bit ) Used at the application level and defined by a profile .
If it is set , it means that the current data has some special relevance for the application .
This is specified by an RTP profile .
* Sequence Number : ( 16 bits ) The sequence number is incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent and is to be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence .
When several media streams are present , the timestamps are independent in each stream , and may not be relied upon for media synchronization .
* SSRC : ( 32 bits ) Synchronization source identifier uniquely identifies the source of a stream .
The synchronization sources within the same RTP session will be unique .
Protocols such as SIP , Jingle , RTSP , H.225 and H.245 are used for session initiation , control and termination .
Other standards , such as H.264 , MPEG and H.263 , are used to encode the payload data as specified via RTP Profile .
The Adaptive Multi @-@ Rate ( AMR or AMR @-@ NB or GSM @-@ AMR ) audio codec is an audio compression format optimized for speech coding .
* The AMR codec uses eight source codecs with bit @-@ rates of 12.2 , 10.2 , 7.95 , 7.40 , 6.70 , 5.90 , 5.15 and 4.75 kbit / s .

Though he had written for the school newspaper at McBurney , Salinger began writing stories " under the covers night , with the aid of a flashlight . "
He also participated in the Glee Club , Aviation Club , French Club , and the Non @-@ Commissioned Officers Club .
Salinger started his freshman year at New York University in 1936 .
That fall , his father urged him to learn about the meat @-@ importing business , and he went to work at a company in Vienna , Austria .
He left Austria one month before it was annexed by Nazi Germany on March 12 , 1938 .

In late 1941 , Salinger briefly worked on a Caribbean cruise ship , serving as an activity director and possibly as a performer .
The same year , Salinger began submitting short stories to " The New Yorker . "
He was active at Utah Beach on D @-@ Day , in the Battle of the Bulge , and the Battle of Hürtgen Forest .
During the campaign from Normandy into Germany , Salinger arranged to meet with Ernest Hemingway , a writer who had influenced him and was then working as a war correspondent in Paris .
He lived in Weissenburg and , soon after , married Sylvia Welter .
He brought her to the United States in April 1946 , but the marriage fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany .
In 1972 , Salinger 's daughter Margaret was with him when he received a letter from Sylvia .
" In 1946 , Whit Burnett agreed to help Salinger publish a collection of his short stories through " Story " Press 's Lippincott Imprint .
In the early 1940s , Salinger had confided in a letter to Whit Burnett that he was eager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve financial security .
Therefore he immediately agreed when , in mid @-@ 1948 , independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn offered to buy the film rights to his short story " Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut . "
It spent 30 weeks on the " New York Times " Bestseller list .
The book remains widely read ; in 2004 , the novel was selling about 250,000 copies per year , " with total worldwide sales over 10 million copies . "
Since its publication , there has been sustained interest in the novel among filmmakers , with Billy Wilder , Harvey Weinstein , and Steven Spielberg among those seeking to secure the rights .
Salinger stated in the 1970s that " Jerry Lewis tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden .
Maynard 's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger , " At Home in the World : A Memoir , " was published the same year .

In the same year , Hesse changed jobs and began working at the antiquarium Wattenwyl in Basel .
In 1924 , Hesse married the singer Ruth Wenger , the daughter of the Swiss writer Lisa Wenger and aunt of Méret Oppenheim .
In the year of his 50th birthday , the first biography of Hesse appeared , written by his friend Hugo Ball .
Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century , he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature .
Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo ( the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca ) , and most of them explore the theme of solitude .

A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers .
Because of the variety of potential applications ( including industrial and military ) , governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research .
Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative , the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars .
The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars .
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , microfabrication , etc .
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .
First , the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds , and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989 .
The microscope 's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 .
Binnig , Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year .
Second , Fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto , Richard Smalley , and Robert Curl , who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
In the early 2000s , the field garnered increased scientific , political , and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress .
Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies , exemplified by the Royal Society 's report on nanotechnology .
These products are limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials and do not involve atomic control of matter .
By the mid @-@ 2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish .
= = Fundamental concepts = = Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale .
This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced .
One nanometer ( nm ) is one billionth , or 10 − 9 , of a meter .
On the other hand , the smallest cellular life @-@ forms , the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma , are around 200 nm in length .
By convention , nanotechnology is taken as the scale range following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US .
To put that scale in another context , the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth .
In the " bottom @-@ up " approach , materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition .
Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics , nanomechanics , nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology .
These include statistical mechanical effects , as well as quantum mechanical effects , for example the " quantum size effect " where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size .
Additionally , a number of physical ( mechanical , electrical , optical , etc .
One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical , thermal and catalytic properties of materials .
For instance , opaque substances can become transparent ( copper ) ; stable materials can turn combustible ( aluminium ) ; insoluble materials may become soluble ( gold ) .
A material such as gold , which is chemically inert at normal scales , can serve as a potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales .
= = = Simple to complex : a molecular perspective = = = Modern synthetic chemistry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure .
These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self @-@ assembly and / or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom @-@ up approach .
The Watson @-@ Crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this , as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate , or the specific folding of the protein itself .
Thus , two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole .
Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms .
The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones .
= = = Molecular nanotechnology : a long @-@ term view = = = Molecular nanotechnology , sometimes called molecular manufacturing , describes engineered nanosystems ( nanoscale machines ) operating on the molecular scale .
Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the molecular assembler , a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom @-@ by @-@ atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis .
Another view , put forth by Carlo Montemagno , is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines .
Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules .
Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible , non @-@ biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy .
Leaders in research on non @-@ biological molecular machines are Dr. Alex Zettl and his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley .
An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999 .
* Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are sometimes used in solar cells which combats the cost of traditional Silicon solar cells .
* Approaches from the field of " classical " chemical synthesis ( Inorganic and organic synthesis ) also aim at designing molecules with well @-@ defined shape ( e.g.
* More generally , molecular self @-@ assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry , and molecular recognition in particular , to cause single @-@ molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation .
Peter Grünberg and Albert Fert received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for their discovery of Giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics .
* Solid @-@ state techniques can also be used to create devices known as nanoelectromechanical systems or NEMS , which are related to microelectromechanical systems or MEMS .
For example , this technique is used routinely to create sub @-@ 100 nm sections of material for analysis in Transmission electron microscopy .
* Molecular scale electronics seeks to develop molecules with useful electronic properties .
= = = Biomimetic approaches = = = * Bionics or biomimicry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature , to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology .
* Bionanotechnology is the use of biomolecules for applications in nanotechnology , including use of viruses and lipid assemblies .
There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine , but it may not be easy to do such a thing because of several drawbacks of such devices .
atomic ) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth , this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution .
* Programmable matter seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily , reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of information science and materials science .
= = Tools and techniques = = There are several important modern developments .
There are other types of scanning probe microscopy .
However , this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope .
Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around .
At present , it is expensive and time @-@ consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation .
The project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database .
Further applications allow tennis balls to last longer , golf balls to fly straighter , and even bowling balls to become more durable and have a harder surface .
Video game consoles and personal computers may become cheaper , faster , and contain more memory thanks to nanotechnology .
Nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the general practitioner 's office and at home .
For these reasons , some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments .
So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully .
A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs .
There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology .
Davies ( 2008 ) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings .
They also propose that NGOs and other citizen groups play a meaningful role in the development of these standards .

Influenced by these two important discoveries , Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis .
She used an innovative technique to investigate samples .
Fifteen years earlier , her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer , a sensitive device for measuring electric charge .
Using Pierre 's electrometer , she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity .
Using this technique , her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present .
She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself .
This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible .

In 2005 , 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem , mostly from the United States , France and the former Soviet Union .
In 2005 , 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in .
Nevertheless , the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate , especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities .
In 1967 , Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population , while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent .
Many move to the suburbs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lifestyle .
This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families .
Demographics and the Jewish @-@ Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem .
In May 2012 , it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate .
Currently , the city 's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family .
Although not mentioned in the Torah / Pentateuch , it is mentioned in the Bible 632 times .
Today , the Western Wall , a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple , is a Jewish holy site second only to the Holy of Holies on the Temple Mount itself .
According to the New Testament , Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple .
The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year , approximately one @-@ third of them tourists .
The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and a scale @-@ model of the Second Temple .
The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city 's western edge , near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl .
It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles .
Further , Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis , and honors the Righteous among the Nations .
The Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra , established in the 1940s , has appeared around the world .
The International Convention Center ( " Binyanei HaUma " ) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra .
Jerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009 .
The Jewish @-@ Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music .
In 2006 , a Jerusalem Trail was opened , a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem .
= = Media = = Jerusalem is the state broadcasting center of Israel .
= = Economy = = Historically , Jerusalem 's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims , as it was located far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza .
Although many statistics indicate economic growth in the city , since 1967 East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem .
According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) , 78 % of Palestinians in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012 .
This marks a steady increase from 2006 when 64 % of Palestinians were in poverty .
In 2006 , the average monthly income for a worker in Jerusalem was NIS5,940 ( US $ 1,410 ) , NIS1,350 less than that for a worker in Tel Aviv .
Only 8.5 % of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector , which is half the national average ( 15.8 % ) .
The Jerusalem Central Bus Station , located on Jaffa Road , is the busiest bus station in Israel .
Founded in 1925 , the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world .
The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud .
Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel .
It describes itself as the " only Arab university in Jerusalem . "
New York Bard College and Al @-@ Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat 's office .
It is one of many schools in Jerusalem , from elementary school and up , that combine secular and religious studies .
Schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of Israel have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students .
A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project .
Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel .
Jerusalem 's other major football team , and one of Beitar 's top rivals , is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C.
Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times , Hapoel has won the Cup only once .
Beitar has won the top league six times , while Hapoel has never succeeded .
Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl , while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit .
The most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber ( since 1976 ) which plays in West Bank Premier League .
The full 42 @-@ kilometer race begins at the Knesset , passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City 's Armenian Quarter , and concludes at Sacher Park .
About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter .
Under the plan , towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street .
One of the proposed towers along King George Street , the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum , is planned as a 65 @-@ story building , which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel .
Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings , and one will be a 2,000 @-@ room hotel .

Amanita phalloides , commonly known as the death cap , is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus , one of many in the genus " Amanita . "
The total mass of a star is the principal determinant of its evolution and eventual fate .
To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System , Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction , an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley .
His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction .
In addition to his other accomplishments , William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight , but are also physical companions that form binary star systems .
The science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi .
In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types .
In 1834 , Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius , and inferred a hidden companion .
The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827 .
The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars .
The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool .
In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope .
In 1913 , the Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram was developed , propelling the astrophysical study of stars .
( Uranus and Neptune were also Greek and Roman gods , but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness .
The German astronomer Johann Bayer created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation .
One example of such a star @-@ forming region is the Orion Nebula .
Once a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability , it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force .
Early stars of less than 2 are called T Tauri stars , while those with greater mass are Herbig Ae / Be stars .
Such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars .
The Sun , for example , is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40 % since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion ( 4.6 × 109 ) years ago .
Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space .
For most stars , the mass lost is negligible .
The Sun loses 10 − 14 every year , or about 0.01 % of its total mass over its entire lifespan .
The duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel , i.e.
For the Sun , its life is estimated to be about 10 billion ( 1010 ) years .
Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short @-@ lived .
However , since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe ( 13.8 billion years ) , no stars under about 0.85 are expected to have moved off the main sequence .
Older , population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger , population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed .
In relatively old , very massive stars , a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star .
If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth , known as a white dwarf .
In larger stars , fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large ( more than 1.4 ) that it can no longer support its own mass .
These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets .
However the proportion of single star systems increases for smaller stars , so that only 25 % of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions .
A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars , and there are more than 100 billion ( 1011 ) galaxies in the observable universe .
The nearest star to the Earth , apart from the Sun , is Proxima Centauri , which is 39.9 trillion kilometres , or 4.2 light @-@ years away .
Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle ( 8 kilometres per second - almost 30,000 kilometres per hour ) , it would take about 150,000 years to get there .
Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers .
= = = Age = = = Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old .
) The more massive the star , the shorter its lifespan , primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores , causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly .
The most massive stars last an average of a few million years , while stars of minimum mass ( red dwarfs ) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years .
The Sun is also a star , but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead , and to provide daylight .
Other than the Sun , the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus , with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds .
Betelgeuse , however , has a much lower density than the Sun .
= = = Kinematics = = = The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star , as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy .
Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun , making them good candidates for parallax measurements .
Among nearby stars , it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older , population II stars .
A study of the Arches cluster suggests that is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe .
This generation of supermassive , population III stars is long extinct , however , and currently only theoretical .
With a mass only 93 times that of Jupiter ( ) , AB Doradus C , a companion to AB Doradus A , is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core .
Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars , while the opposite is the case for degenerate , compact stars such as white dwarfs .
Young stars can have a rapid rate of rotation greater than 100 km / s at the equator .
This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km / s where the star would break apart .
The surface temperature of a star , along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features , is used to classify a star ( see classification below ) .
= = Radiation = = The energy produced by stars , as a product of nuclear fusion , radiates into space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation .
In fact , stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared , visible light , ultraviolet , to the shortest of X @-@ rays , and gamma rays .
) With these parameters , astronomers can also estimate the age of the star .
= = = Luminosity = = = The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time .
The luminosity of a star is determined by the radius and the surface temperature .
Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star 's luminosity and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs ( 32.6 light @-@ years ) .
The brightest stars , on either scale , have negative magnitude numbers .
Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius , however , Sirius appears brighter than Canopus .
This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light @-@ years from the Earth , while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light @-@ years .
As of 2006 , the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV 1806 @-@ 20 , with a magnitude of − 14.2 .
The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster .
The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26 , while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered .
The Sun is a main sequence " G2V " yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size .
This group includes protostars , Wolf @-@ Rayet stars , and Flare stars , as well as giant and supergiant stars .
A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol , which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 over a period of 2.87 days .
Instead , for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core .
This can occur , for example , in regions where very high energy fluxes occur , such as near the core or in areas with high opacity as in the outer envelope .
This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light .
In a main sequence star such as the Sun , the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region , where spicules appear and stellar flares begin .
The hydrogen fusion process is temperature @-@ sensitive , so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate .
As a result the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M @-@ class star to 40 million kelvin for a massive O @-@ class star .
The example below shows the amount of time required for a star of 20 to consume all of its nuclear fuel .
As an O @-@ class main sequence star , it would be 8 times the solar radius and 62,000 times the Sun 's luminosity .
It is surrounded to the north by the district of Kadışehri , in the south by Çayıralan , Sarikaya and Saraykent in the west and the Sarkisla district in the east .

Many ideas from this book appeared in different form in Däniken 's books .
He has failed to credit these authors properly or at all , even when making the same claims using similar or identical evidence .
Däniken also wrote about a collection of gold objects held by local priest Father Crespi , who had special permission from the Vatican to do archeological research .
But an archeologist reported to " Der Spiegel " that , while there were some gold pieces , many were just local imitations for tourists , and that Crespi has difficulty distinguishing brass from gold .
Dr. Samuel Rosenberg said that the Book of Dzyan , referred to by Däniken , was " a fabrication superimposed on a gigantic hoax concocted by Madame Blavatsky .
" According to NYT 's Richard R. Lingerman , it is likely that Däniken obtained these references from UFO books that mentioned them as real documents .
The idea was not originated by Däniken : it started as a joke made by people who first saw the lines from the air and had already been published by other people .
His theory relies on the book of " Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings " by Charles Hapgood .
A. D. Crown , in " Some Trust in Chariots , " explains how this is simply wrong .
The map in Däniken 's book only extends five degrees south of the equator , ending in Cape São Roque , which means that it doesn 't extend to Antarctica .
But Piri Reis said that he had drawn that map himself using old maps , and the map is consistent with the cartographic knowledge of that time .
Other authors had already published this same idea , a fact that Däniken did not recognize until 1974 in an interview with " Playboy " magazine .
The rocket motor under the figure is the face of a monster , symbol of the underworld .
Däniken says that he asked Doctor Cabrera , a local surgeon who owns the museum , and Cabrera had told him that the potter 's claims were a lie and that the stones were ancient .
Jungfrau Park located near Interlaken , Switzerland , was opened as the Mystery Park in 2003 .
Ridley Scott said that his film " Prometheus " is related to some of Däniken 's ideas regarding early human civilization .
" Däniken is an occasional presenter on the History Channel and H2 show " Ancient Aliens , " where he talks about aspects of his theories as they pertain to each episode .
Däniken is a member of the Swiss Writers Association , the German Writers Association and the International PEN Club .
He received the Huesped Illustre award from the cities of Ica and Nazca in Peru .

Still , it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men , 1,000 tanks , 7,600 guns .
But the weather began to change against the Germans .

Guderian nevertheless was able to pursue the offensive , spreading his forces in a star @-@ like attack , taking Stalinogorsk on 22 November 1941 and surrounding a Soviet rifle division stationed there .
Heinz Guderian wrote in his journal that " the offensive on Moscow failed ... We underestimated the enemy 's strength , as well as his size and climate .
Fortunately , I stopped my troops on 5 December , otherwise the catastrophe would be unavoidable .
On 5 December 1941 , the counteroffensive started on the Kalinin Front .
After two days of little progress , Soviet armies retook Krasnaya Polyana and several other cities in the immediate vicinity of Moscow .
German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their present locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines .
On 14 December , Franz Halder and Günther von Kluge finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the Oka river , without Hitler 's approval .
It was a last minute effort and it worked .
In the center , Soviet progress was much slower .
Soviet troops liberated Naro @-@ Fominsk only on 26 December , Kaluga on 28 December , and Maloyaroslavets on 2 January , after 10 days of violent action .
As Guderian wrote in his memoirs , " This created a chill in our relations , a chill that could never be eliminated afterwards .
Ultimately , these failures would lead to a successful German offensive in the south and to the Battle of Stalingrad .
John Erickson , in his " Barbarossa : The Axis and the Allies , " gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942 .

Migraine is a chronic neurological disease characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms .
Typically the headache affects one half of the head , is pulsating in nature , and lasts from 2 to 72 hours .
Changing hormone levels may also play a role , as migraines affect slightly more boys than girls before puberty , but about two to three times more women than men .
The primary theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem .
= = = Aura phase = = = An aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache .
Auras appear gradually over a number of minutes and generally last less than 60 minutes .
Symptoms can be visual , sensory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one .
Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines .
Often a feeling of pins @-@ and @-@ needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose @-@ mouth area on the same side .
Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine , and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras .
The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults , however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour .
However , they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors .
A number of psychological conditions are associated , including depression , anxiety , and bipolar disorder , as are many biological events or triggers .
This genetic relationship is stronger for migraines with aura than for migraines without aura .
One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine , a type of migraine with aura , which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion .
Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy .
These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura .
Some researchers believe neuronal mechanisms play a greater role , while others believe blood vessels play the key role .
High levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin , also known as 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine , are believed to be involved .
After the burst of activity the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours .
In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17 % .
* Complications of migraine describe migraine headaches and / or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent , or associated with a seizure or brain lesion .
* Probable migraine describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines , but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty ( in the presence of concurrent medication overuse ) .
They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraines .
This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache .
Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity , while frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine .
Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective .
Chiropractic manipulation , physiotherapy , massage and relaxation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches ; however , the research had some problems with methodology .
= = = Devices and surgery = = = Medical devices , such as biofeedback and neurostimulators , have some advantages in migraine prevention , mainly when common anti @-@ migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse .
Migraine surgery , which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck , may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications .
Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain , with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan .
Paracetamol ( also known as acetaminophen ) , either alone or in combination with metoclopramide , is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects .
They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics .
Most side effects are mild , such as flushing ; however , rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred .
There are four main patterns to the disease : symptoms can resolve completely , symptoms can continue but become gradually less with time , symptoms may continue at the same frequency and severity , or attacks may become worse and more frequent .
Being a young adult , being female , using hormonal contraception , and smoking further increases this risk .
The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association .
Rates of migraines are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries .
These figures vary substantially with age : migraines most commonly start between 15 and 24 years of age and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age .
During adolescence migraines becomes more common among women and this persists for the rest of the lifespan , being two times more common among elderly females than males .
Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania ( half @-@ head ) , from which the word migraine was eventually derived .

* Resistance ( R ) plasmids , which contain genes that provide resistance against antibiotics or poisons .
This is a cheap and easy way of mass @-@ producing the protein the gene codes for , for example , insulin .
For their use as vectors , and for molecular cloning , plasmids often need to be isolated .
Finally , the mRNA is degraded .
As in DNA , mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides , which are arranged into codons consisting of three bases each .
Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid , except the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis .
During its life , an mRNA molecule may also be processed , edited , and transported prior to translation .
This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes .
The short @-@ lived , unprocessed or partially processed product is termed " precursor mRNA , " or " pre @-@ mRNA " ; once completely processed , it is termed " mature mRNA . "
= = = Eukaryotic pre @-@ mRNA processing = = = Processing of mRNA differs greatly among eukaryotes , bacteria , and archea .
This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping .
This process is called alternative splicing .
The poly ( A ) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases .
Just as in alternative splicing , there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA .
= = = Transport = = = Another difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport .
Eukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm ( i.e. , mature mRNA ) can then be translated by the ribosome .
In general , the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA , UAG , or UGA .
The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs .
Cytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3 ' UTR .
These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA .
= = = Poly ( A ) tail = = = The 3 ' poly ( A ) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides ( often several hundred ) added to the 3 ' end of the pre @-@ mRNA .
= = = Monocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA = = = An mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain ( polypeptide ) .
The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA .
The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs .
= = = Prokaryotic mRNA degradation = = = In general , in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes .
Messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes , the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF @-@ 4E and eIF @-@ 4G , and poly ( A ) -binding protein .
eIF @-@ 4E and eIF @-@ 4G block the decapping enzyme ( DCP2 ) , and poly ( A ) -binding protein blocks the exosome complex , protecting the ends of the message .
AU @-@ rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto @-@ oncogenic transcription factors like c @-@ Jun and c @-@ Fos .
siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture .
This sequence is important for the recognition of tRNA by enzymes and critical in translation .
In prokaryotes , the CCA sequence is transcribed in some tRNA sequences .
To provide a one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between tRNA molecules and codons that specify amino acids , 61 types of tRNA molecules would be required per cell .
It produces tRNA molecules with their CCA 3 ' ends covalently linked to an amino acid .
Reaction : # amino acid + ATP → aminoacyl @-@ AMP + PPi # aminoacyl @-@ AMP + tRNA → aminoacyl @-@ tRNA + AMPSometimes , certain organisms can have one or more aminoacyl tRNA synthetases missing .
This leads to mischarging of the tRNA by a chemically related amino acid .
The correct amino acid is made by enzymes that modify the mischarged amino acid to the correct one .
For example , " Helicobacter pylori " has glutaminyl tRNA synthetase missing .
An amidotransferase then converts the acid side chain of the glutamate to the amide , forming the correctly charged gln @-@ tRNA @-@ Gln .
The nematode worm " C. elegans , " a commonly used model organism in genetics studies , has 29,647 genes in its nuclear genome , of which 620 code for tRNA .
The budding yeast " Saccharomyces cerevisiae " has 275 tRNA genes in its genome .
These genes are found on all chromosomes , except 22 and Y chromosome .
High clustering on 6p is observed ( 140 tRNA genes ) , as well on 1 chromosome .
In 1965 , Robert W. Holley of Cornell University reported the primary structure and suggested three secondary structures .
Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA , 23S ribosomal RNA , and 5S rRNA genes are typically organized as a co @-@ transcribed operon .
The 18S rRNA in most eukaryotes is in the small ribosomal subunit , and the large subunit contains three rRNA species ( the 5S , 5.8S and 28S in mammals , 25S in plants , rRNAs ) .
Mammalian cells have 2 mitochondrial ( 12S and 16S ) rRNA molecules and 4 types of cytoplasmic rRNA ( the 28S , 5.8S , 18S , and 5S subunits ) .
The 45S rDNA is organized into 5 clusters ( each has 30 @-@ 40 repeats ) on chromosomes 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 .
A model of the secondary structure for the 5 ' domain ( 500 @-@ 800 nucleotides ) is shown .
* rRNA is one of only a few gene products present in all cells .
As a result , many thousands of rRNA sequences are known and stored in specialized databases such as RDP @-@ II and SILVA .

= = History = = Evolutionary biology , as an academic discipline in its own right , emerged during the period of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s .
Similar features have led to progress in viral evolution , particularly for bacteriophages .
Modern evolutionary biology incorporates ideas from diverse areas of science , such as molecular genetics and even computer science .
First , some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for by the work of the modern evolutionary synthesis .
Third , the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes .
Today , evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation .
One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical population genetics that catalyzed the modern evolutionary synthesis must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge .
This requires a great deal of mathematical development to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of molecular evolution .
Current research seeks to determine this .
Evolutionary forces include natural selection , sexual selection , genetic drift , genetic draft , developmental constraints , mutation bias and biogeography .
For example , evolutionary thinking is key to life history theory .

Galileo is the indigenous global navigation satellite system ( GNSS ) that is currently being created by the European Union ( EU ) and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
In December 2010 EU ministers in Brussels voted Prague in the Czech Republic as the headquarters of the Galileo project .
On 21 October 2011 the first two of four operational satellites were launched to validate the system .
The next two followed on 12 October 2012 , making it " possible to test Galileo end @-@ to @-@ end . "
Once this In @-@ Orbit Validation ( IOV ) phase has been completed , additional satellites will be launched to reach Initial Operational Capability ( IOC ) around mid @-@ decade .
Galileo is planned to provide a unique global search and rescue ( SAR ) function .
At the same time , the system is projected to provide a signal to the users , informing them that their situation has been detected and help is on the way .
This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing GPS and GLONASS navigation systems , which do not provide feedback to the user .
= = History = = = = = Main objectives = = = In 1999 , the different concepts ( from Germany , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) for Galileo were compared and reduced to one by a joint team of engineers from all four countries .

On 17 January 2002 a spokesman for the project stated that , as a result of US pressure and economic difficulties , " Galileo is almost dead .
" A few months later , however , the situation changed dramatically .
The European Union and the European Space Agency agreed in March 2002 to fund the project , pending a review in 2003 ( which was completed on 26 May 2003 ) .
The required satellites ( the planned number is 30 ) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014 , with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019 .
The final cost is estimated at € 3 billion , including the infrastructure on Earth , constructed in 2006 and 2007 .
The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two @-@ thirds of the cost of implementation , with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost .
By early 2011 costs for the project had run 50 % over initial estimates .

In this analogy , different notes correspond to different particles .
In string theory , one of the modes of oscillation of the string corresponds to a massless , spin @-@ 2 particle .
Such a particle is called a graviton since it mediates a force which has the properties of gravity .
Since string theory is believed to be a mathematically consistent quantum mechanical theory , the existence of this graviton state implies that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity .
The two types of string behave in slightly different ways , yielding different particle types .
For example , all string theories have closed string graviton modes , but only open strings can correspond to the particles known as photons .
Because the two ends of an open string can always meet and connect , forming a closed string , all string theories contain closed strings .
The earliest string model , the bosonic string , incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons .
This model describes , at low enough energies , a quantum gravity theory , which also includes ( if open strings are incorporated as well ) gauge bosons such as the photon .
What is most significant is that the theory has a fundamental instability , believed to result in the decay ( at least partially ) of spacetime itself .
In addition , as the name implies , the spectrum of particles contains only bosons , particles which , like the photon , obey particular rules of behavior .

Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count , electrolytes , renal function , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) .
A white blood cell count as high as 40.0 × 109 / l ( 40,000 / mm3 ) has been documented .
This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment .

Improvement may be seen within four hours , and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks .

Urate @-@ lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300 @-@ 360 µmol / l ( 5.0 @-@ 6.0 mg / dl ) , and are continued indefinitely .
In such cases , the alternative drug , febuxostat , has been recommended .
Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , metabolic syndrome , and renal and cardiovascular disease , and thus are at increased risk of death .
This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity , but some of the increased risk appears to be independent .
Other forms of chronic renal dysfunction may occur .
In men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50 , prevalence is 2 % .
In the United States , gout is twice as likely in African American males as it is in European Americans .

In mammals , there are two broad types of stem cells : embryonic stem cells , which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts , and adult stem cells , which are found in various tissues .
Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s .
= = = Potency definition = = = " Potency " specifies the differentiation potential ( the potential to differentiate into different cell types ) of the stem cell .
Such cells can construct a complete , viable organism .
* Pluripotent stem cells are the descendants of totipotent cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells , i.e.
* Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into a number of cell types , but only those of a closely related family of cells .
* Oligopotent stem cells can differentiate into only a few cell types , such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells .
progenitor cells , muscle stem cells ) .
For example , the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs .
In other words , they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type .
Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells ( mES ) or human embryonic stem cells ( hES ) .
Both have the essential stem cell characteristics , yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state .
Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of gelatin as an extracellular matrix ( for support ) and require the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) .
Human ES cells are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF or FGF @-@ 2 ) .
Without optimal culture conditions or genetic manipulation , embryonic stem cells will rapidly differentiate .
A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins .
The cell surface antigens most commonly used to identify hES cells are the glycolipids stage specific embryonic antigen 3 and 4 and the keratan sulfate antigens Tra @-@ 1 @-@ 60 and Tra @-@ 1 @-@ 81 .
The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research .
There are currently no approved treatments using embryonic stem cells .
The first human trial was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2009 .
However , the human trial was not initiated until October 13 , 2010 in Atlanta for spinal injury victims .
Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency , embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease .
= = Adult = = Adult stem cells , also called somatic ( from Greek Σωματικóς , " of the body " ) stem cells , are stem cells which maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found .
Pluripotent adult stem cells are rare and generally small in number , but they can be found in umbilical cord blood and other tissues .
Bone marrow is a rich source of adult stem cells , which have been used in treating several conditions including spinal cord injury , liver cirrhosis , chronic limb ischemia and endstage heart failure .
In mice , pluripotent stem cells are directly generated from adult fibroblast cultures .
Adult stem cell treatments have been successfully used for many years to treat leukemia and related bone / blood cancers through bone marrow transplants .
Adult stem cells are also used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon and ligament injuries in horses .
The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells , because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an embryo .
Roman Catholic teaching forbids the use of embryonic stem cells in experimentation ; accordingly , the Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " called amniotic stem cells " the future of medicine . "
Using genetic reprogramming with protein transcription factors , pluripotent stem cells equivalent to embryonic stem cells have been derived from human adult skin tissue .

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company .
The series is a satirical depiction of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by the Simpson family , which consists of Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa , and Maggie .
The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture , society , television , and many aspects of the human condition .
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks .
Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family , substituting Bart for his own name .
The shorts became a part of " The Tracey Ullman Show " on April 19 , 1987 .
It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series , including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards , 30 Annie Awards , and a Peabody Award .
The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in " The Tracey Ullman Show " on April 19 , 1987 .
The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo , with Wes Archer , David Silverman , and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season .
Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow .
In 1989 , a team of production companies adapted " The Simpsons " into a half @-@ hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company .
The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house .
" Some Enchanted Evening " was the first full @-@ length episode produced , but it did not broadcast until May 1990 , as the last episode of the first season , because of animation problems .
In 1992 , Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox , claiming that her show was the source of the series ' success .
He was constantly at odds with Groening , Brooks and the show 's production company Gracie Films and left in 1993 .
The main writer of each episode writes the first draft .
Until 2004 , George Meyer , who had developed the show since the first season , was active in these sessions .
Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events .
English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode " Homer Simpson , This Is Your Wife , " becoming the first celebrity to both write and guest star in an episode .
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg , writers of the film " Superbad , " wrote the episode " Homer the Whopper , " with Rogen voicing a character in it .
Castellaneta performs Homer Simpson , Grampa Simpson , Krusty the Clown , Groundskeeper Willie , Mayor Quimby , Barney Gumble and other adult , male characters .
Julie Kavner speaks the voices of Marge Simpson and Patty and Selma , as well as several minor characters .
Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of " The Tracey Ullman Show " cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed .
Cartwright performs the voices of Bart Simpson , Nelson Muntz , Ralph Wiggum and other children .
Smith , the voice of Lisa Simpson , is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character , although she occasionally plays other episodic characters .
The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa .
Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart , but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high , so she was given the role of Lisa instead .
Every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance .
Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and , therefore , closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists .
In addition to the main cast , Pamela Hayden , Tress MacNeille , Marcia Wallace , Maggie Roswell , and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters .
From 1999 to 2002 , Roswell 's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven .
Repeat " special guest " cast members include Albert Brooks , Phil Hartman , Jon Lovitz , Joe Mantegna , and Kelsey Grammer .
In the earlier seasons , most of the guest stars voiced characters , but eventually more started appearing as themselves .
Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself , appearing briefly in the season two episode " Dancin ' Homer . "
It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French .
For example , Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs .
Throughout the run of the animated shorts on " The Tracey Ullman Show , " the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo .
In Season 14 , production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint .
The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was " Radioactive Man " in 1995 .
The already completed " Tennis the Menace " was broadcast as made .
The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town , serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle .
The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society .
By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant , the show can comment on the state of the environment .
Through Bart and Lisa 's days at Springfield Elementary School , the show 's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education .
The town features a vast array of media channels - from kids ' television programming to local news , which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry .
In " The Simpsons , " politicians are corrupt , ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers , and the local police force is incompetent .
In times of crisis , the family often turns to God , and the show has dealt with most of the major religions .
The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home .
The series ' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989 , after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece .
These pieces usually involve the family in some horror , science fiction , or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres .
Such references , for example , come from movies , television , music , literature , science , and history .
The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing .
" One of Bart 's early hallmarks was his prank calls to Moe 's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name .
The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting .
However , Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising .
Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson , an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies , who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone .
The phrase quickly spread to other journalists .
" I , for one , welcome our new insect overlords , " was used by Kent Brockman in " Deep Space Homer " and has become a common variety of phrase .
The dismissive term " Meh , " believed to have been popularized by the show , entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008 .

ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday , where it would compete with " The Cosby Show " on NBC , the number one show at the time .
Through the summer , several news outlets published stories about the supposed " Bill vs. Bart " rivalry .
At the time , it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network , and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of " The Simpsons . "
" In a 1990 review of the show , Ken Tucker of " Entertainment Weekly " described it as " the American family at its most complicated , drawn as simple cartoons .
" Tucker would also describe the show as a " pop @-@ cultural phenomenon , a prime @-@ time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family .
Bart was the only fictional character on the list .
On January 14 , 2000 , the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
Also in 2000 , " Entertainment Weekly " magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named " The Simpsons " the greatest television show of the 1990s .
Homer would also place ninth on " Entertainment Weekly " list of the " 50 Greatest TV icons . "
= = = Criticism and controversy = = = Bart 's rebellious nature , which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior , led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children .
In response , Matt Groening said , " That sums up Bart , all right .
Most people are in a struggle to be normal he thinks normal is very boring , and does things that others just wished they dare do .
We 're praying for an end to the Depression , too .
Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode " A Star Is Burns " ( season six , 1995 ) which featured a crossover with " The Critic . "
The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer , who provides the voice of Skinner .
In a 2001 interview , Shearer recalled that after reading the script , he told the writers , " That 's so wrong .
" Mike Scully , who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve , has been the subject of criticism .
In 2004 , Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show 's declining quality : " I rate the last three seasons as among the worst , so Season Four looks very good to me now .
The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative , and the stories do things that we haven 't done before .

Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series " The Simpsons . "
She is the middle child of the Simpson family .
Voiced by Yeardley Smith , Lisa first appeared on television in " The Tracey Ullman Show " short " Good Night " on April 19 , 1987 .
Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks .
Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic " Life in Hell , " but instead decided to create a new set of characters .
After appearing on " The Tracey Ullman Show " for three years , the Simpson family were moved to their own series on Fox , which debuted on December 17 , 1989 .
At eight years old , Lisa is the second child of Homer and Marge , younger sister of Bart and older sister of Maggie .
She is highly intelligent and plays the baritone saxophone .
Producers considered Smith 's voice too high for a boy , so she was given the role of Lisa .
Her environmentalism has been especially well received ; several episodes featuring her have won Genesis and Environmental Media Awards , including a special " Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award " in 2001 .
Lisa 's year of birth is given in " Lisa 's First Word " ( season 4 , 1992 ) as 1984 , during the Summer Olympics .
Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family , and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes .

Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19 , 1987 in " The Tracey Ullman Show " short " Good Night . "
Lisa and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show .
Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be , but also the kind of child we want " all " children to be .
But , at the time , on " The Tracey Ullman Show , " she was just an animated eight @-@ year @-@ old kid who had no personality .

In the seventh @-@ season episode " Lisa the Vegetarian " ( 1995 ) , Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian , distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice .
The episode was written by David S. Cohen ( in his first solo writing credit ) who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch .
The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney , a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist .
The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show .
In the episode " Mother Simpson " ( season seven , 1995 ) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time .
In 2000 , Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard .

There are six types of quarks , known as " flavors " : up , down , strange , charm , top , and bottom .
Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks .
The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay : the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state .
Because of this , up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe , whereas strange , charm , bottom , and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions ( such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators ) .
The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell @-@ Mann and George Zweig in 1964 .
The first generation includes up and down quarks , the second strange and charm quarks , and the third bottom and top quarks .
All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed , < / ref > and there is strong indirect evidence that no more than three generations exist .
Only first @-@ generation ( up and down ) quarks occur commonly in nature .
= = History = = The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell @-@ Mann ( pictured ) and George Zweig in 1964 .
Gell @-@ Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles , but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks .
There was particular contention about whether the quark was a physical entity or a mere abstraction used to explain concepts that were not fully understood at the time .
In less than a year , extensions to the Gell @-@ Mann @-@ Zweig model were proposed .
Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted the existence of a fourth flavor of quark , which they called " charm . "
In 1968 , deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) showed that the proton contained much smaller , point @-@ like objects and was therefore not an elementary particle .
The objects that were observed at SLAC would later be identified as up and down quarks as the other flavors were discovered .
Nevertheless , " parton " remains in use as a collective term for the constituents of hadrons ( quarks , antiquarks , and gluons ) .
In a 1970 paper , Glashow , John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani presented further reasoning for the existence of the as @-@ yet undiscovered charm quark .
The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973 , when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks .
Charm quarks were produced almost simultaneously by two teams in November 1974 ( see November Revolution ) - one at SLAC under Burton Richter , and one at Brookhaven National Laboratory under Samuel Ting .
The discovery finally convinced the physics community of the quark model 's validity .
Of these , the 1975 paper by Haim Harari was the first to coin the terms " top " and " bottom " for the additional quarks .
In 1977 , the bottom quark was observed by a team at Fermilab led by Leon Lederman .
The up and down quarks are named after the up and down components of isospin , which they carry .
For example , the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei , neutrons and protons , have charges of 0 and + 1 respectively ; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark , and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark .
= = = Spin = = = Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles , and its direction is an important degree of freedom .
For quarks , a measurement of the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values + " ħ " / 2 or − " ħ " / 2 ; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles .
For example , an up quark with a spin of + along the " z " axis is denoted by u ↑ .
= = = Weak interaction = = = A quark of one flavor can transform into a quark of another flavor only through the weak interaction , one of the four fundamental interactions in particle physics .
The boson then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino .
The relative tendencies of all flavor transformations are described by a mathematical table , called the Cabibbo @-@ Kobayashi @-@ Maskawa matrix ( CKM matrix ) .
There exists an equivalent weak interaction matrix for leptons ( right side of the W boson on the above beta decay diagram ) , called the Pontecorvo @-@ Maki @-@ Nakagawa @-@ Sakata matrix ( PMNS matrix ) .
Together , the CKM and PMNS matrices describe all flavor transformations , but the links between the two are not yet clear .
Every quark carries a color , while every antiquark carries an anticolor .
Similarly , the combination of three quarks , each with different color charges , or three antiquarks , each with anticolor charges , will result in the same " white " color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon .
Color SU ( 3 ) ( commonly abbreviated to SU ( 3 ) c ) is the gauge symmetry that relates the color charge in quarks and is the defining symmetry for quantum chromodynamics .
SU ( 3 ) c color transformations correspond to " rotations " in color space ( which , mathematically speaking , is a complex space ) .
These masses typically have very different values .
While gluons are inherently massless , they possess energy - more specifically , quantum chromodynamics binding energy ( QCBE ) - and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron ( see mass in special relativity ) .
The Standard Model posits that elementary particles derive their masses from the Higgs mechanism , which is related to the Higgs boson .
= = = Table of properties = = = The following table summarizes the key properties of the six quarks .
The baryon number ( " B " ) is + for all quarks , as baryons are made of three quarks .
Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge .
When a gluon is transferred between quarks , a color change occurs in both ; for example , if a red quark emits a red @-@ antigreen gluon , it becomes green , and if a green quark absorbs a red @-@ antigreen gluon , it becomes red .
Therefore , while each quark 's color constantly changes , their strong interaction is preserved .
Above a certain energy threshold , pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created .
This process of hadronization occurs before quarks , formed in a high energy collision , are able to interact in any other way .
= = = Sea quarks = = = Hadrons , along with the " valence quarks " ( ) that contribute to their quantum numbers , contain virtual quark @-@ antiquark ( ) pairs known as " sea quarks " ( ) .

Multicast uses network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once , even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers .
For these reasons , and also reasons of economics , IP multicast is not , in general , used in commercial Internet backbones .

Protocol Independent Multicast ( PIM ) is then used between the local and remote multicast routers , to direct multicast traffic from the multicast server to many multicast clients .
Any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of causality .
= = = Tourism in time = = = Stephen Hawking has suggested that the absence of tourists from the future is an argument against the existence of time travel : this is a variant of the Fermi paradox .

This could provide an alternative explanation for Hawking 's observation : a time machine will be built someday , but has not yet been built , so the tourists from the future cannot reach this far back in time .
More technically , the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions , such as the null energy condition along with the weak , strong , and dominant energy conditions .
However , it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition , and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics .
Although early calculations suggested a very large amount of negative energy would be required , later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small .
However , the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it .
A similar device might be built from a cosmic string , but none are known to exist , and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string .
Physicist Robert Forward noted that a naïve application of general relativity to quantum mechanics suggests another way to build a time machine .
A heavy atomic nucleus in a strong magnetic field would elongate into a cylinder , whose density and " spin " are enough to build a time machine .
I can prove that to build a finite time machine , you need negative energy .
Nimtz told " New Scientist " magazine : " For the time being , this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of .
Mallett has some physical arguments that suggest that closed timelike curves would become possible through the center of a laser that has been twisted into a loop .
His experiment involved slow light as well as passing light through a vacuum .
He generated two single photons , passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser ( thus slowing the light ) and passing one through a vacuum .
According to Du , this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than " c " ( and , thus , violating causality ) .
Some members of the media took this as an indication of proof that time travel was impossible .
It has been calculated that , under general relativity , a person could travel forward in time at a rate four times that of distant observers by residing inside a spherical shell with a diameter of 5 meters and the mass of Jupiter .
Of course , squeezing the mass of a large planet into such a structure is not expected to be within our technological capabilities in the near future .
= = = Time perception = = = Time perception can be apparently sped up for living organisms through hibernation , where the body temperature and metabolic rate of the creature is reduced .
If a subatomic particle with a short lifetime were to be observed lasting longer this would suggest it had traveled into the future at an accelerated rate .
Everett 's many @-@ worlds interpretation ( MWI ) of quantum mechanics suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories .
These alternate , or parallel , histories would form a branching tree symbolizing all possible outcomes of any interaction .
This concept is most often used in science @-@ fiction , but some physicists such as David Deutsch have suggested that if time travel is possible and the MWI is correct , then a time traveler should indeed end up in a different history than the one he started from .
And the physicist Allen Everett argued that Deutsch 's approach " involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics ; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI . "
Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil proposed that quantum theory gives a model for time travel without paradoxes .
This effect was referred to as " spooky action at a distance " by Einstein .
Nevertheless , the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories , and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication .
In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed , more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal , some form of classical communication must also be used .
Compared to other fundamental concepts in modern physics , time is still not understood very well .
Philosophers have been theorizing about the nature of time since before the era of the ancient Greek philosophers .
Some philosophers and physicists who study the nature of time also study the possibility of time travel and its logical implications .
For more information on the philosophical considerations of time travel , consult the work of David Lewis .
For more information on physics @-@ related theories of time travel , consider the work of Kurt Gödel ( especially his theorized universe ) and Lawrence Sklar .
This would mean that time is just another dimension , that future events are " already there , " and that there is no objective flow of time .
This view is disputed by Tim Maudlin in his " The Metaphysics Within Physics . "
In this view , time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to .
Consider Lewis " example of Tim .
The only problem for Tim is that his grandfather died years ago .
Tim wants so badly to kill his grandfather himself that he constructs a time machine to travel back to 1955 when his grandfather was young and kill him then .
Suppose that Tim has a rifle , years of rifle training , a straight shot on a clear day and no outside force to restrain Tim 's trigger finger .
Considering these facts , it would appear that Tim can in fact kill his grandfather .
In other words , all of the contextual facts are compossible with Tim killing his grandfather .
The Novikov self @-@ consistency principle proposes that the local laws of physics in a region of spacetime containing time travelers cannot be any different from the local laws of physics in any other region of spacetime .
The philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in " Time Travel Paradoxes " that in an ontological paradox scenario involving a physical object , there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics .
As Ross states " The watch is an impossible object .
It violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics , the Law of Entropy .
If time travel makes that watch possible , then time travel itself is impossible .

Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as " by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis . "
He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father .
Despite Daniel 's attempts at reconciliation , his father carried the grudge until his death .
When Daniel was seven , his younger brother Johann II Bernoulli was born .
However , Daniel refused , because he wanted to study mathematics .
He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics , but was very unhappy there , and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersberg .
He returned to the University of Basel , where he successively held the chairs of medicine , metaphysics , and natural philosophy until his death .

Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids .
However , Bernoulli 's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane ; that is its air speed .
Taking his discoveries further , Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy .
Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure .
A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls .
He worked with Euler on elasticity and the development of the Euler @-@ Bernoulli beam equation .

SEAT , S.A. ( ) is a Spanish automobile manufacturer with its head office in Martorell , Spain .
It was founded on May 9 , 1950 , by the " Instituto Nacional de Industria " ( INI ) , a state @-@ owned industrial holding company .
It is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the German Volkswagen Group , as a member of the now @-@ defunct Audi Brand Group , together with Audi and Lamborghini , and marketed as a car maker with a youthful sporty profile .
The headquarters of SEAT , S.A. are located at SEAT 's industrial complex in Martorell near Barcelona , Spain .
Its headquarters and main manufacturing facilities are located in Martorell , an industrial town located some 30 kilometres northwest of Barcelona , with a production capacity of around 500,000 units per annum .
The plant was opened by King Juan Carlos of Spain on February 22 , 1993 , and replaced SEAT 's former assembly plant by the coast in Barcelona 's freeport zone ( Zona Franca ) .
A rail connection between SEAT 's Martorell and Zona Franca complexes facilitates vehicle and parts transportation between the two sites .
For example , the development and design of several Audi models ( e.g.
In Wolfsburg , Germany , in the middle of a lake inside the Autostadt , the Volkswagen Group 's corporate theme park , is SEAT 's thematic pavilion , one of the largest pavilions in the park .
Its core market remains Europe , while the most successful market outside of Europe in terms of sales for SEAT is currently Mexico , where the company has dealer presence in 27 Mexican states .
Some of its cars have been sold outside Europe , branded as Volkswagens , such as the SEAT Ibiza hatchback , known in South Africa as the Volkswagen Polo Playa , the SEAT Inca panel van as the Volkswagen Caddy , or the SEAT Córdoba , also known as the Volkswagen Polo Classic .
The situation greatly deteriorated with the Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939 .
The lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war Spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests .
Fiat 's collaboration with the French company Simca proved Fiat 's ability to manage complex international projects .
In Italy , Fiat dominated the market for vehicles under 12 horsepower , which would initially be the main market segment in Spain .
The first car in the marque 's history to be produced was a SEAT 1400 model that came off the production line on November 13 , 1953 with licence plate ' B @-@ 87.223 ' .
On December 6 , 1967 , SEAT also founded its own customer financing company ' Financiera SEAT , S.A. ' ( Fiseat ) .
To be able to produce independently its own research projects , SEAT on November 16 , 1970 came in accordance with Fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies .
The 1970s were a decade of rising prosperity in Spain , which is reflected in the announcement in August 1976 that SEAT would commence local production of the Lancia Beta .
The launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against SEAT , as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in Fiat 's range , the Ritmo .
However , the Spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as Toyota , Nissan and Mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for SEAT .
SEAT launched its new Ibiza , a Giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of System Porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the Fiat Ritmo / Strada , in 1984 .
It also formed the basis of the Malaga , a four @-@ door family saloon .
In December 1990 the Volkswagen Group acquired 99.99 % ownership of the company , thus making SEAT the first non @-@ German wholly owned subsidiary of the Group .
The first cars that rolled out of the Martorell plant production lines were the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 and its saloon version , the SEAT Córdoba Mk1 .
The first time a SEAT model was manufactured out of Spain was in 1996 , with the production of the SEAT Alhambra Mk1 in the Palmela AutoEuropa plant in Portugal .
Also on January 1997 it was the first time when a non @-@ Spanish descendant , the Belgian Pierre @-@ Alain de Smedt , was ever appointed SEAT 's chairman .
Next year on July 1 , 2000 Dr. Bernd Peter Pischetsrieder , the former Chief Executive Officer of BMW , was appointed to head SEAT .
In the spring of 2002 as Pischetsrieder was commissioned to chair the entire Volkswagen Group , he gave way to his German compatriot Andreas Schleef on March 7 , 2002 .
The Ibiza allowed the company to further evolve its rallying experience , and was officially engaged in some European national championships .

SEAT 's success with the León TDI was continued , and resulted in winning consecutively 2008 World Touring Car Championship and 2009 World Touring Car Championship both titles ( for drivers ' as well as for manufacturers ' ) .
In September 2008 , SEAT UK announced that it was to withdraw from all motor sport activity in the UK at the end of the season .
The SEAT Cupra Championship and the SEAT BTCC campaign are to end at Brands Hatch on 21 September .
At the opening of the 2009 WTCC , SEAT placed 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and 4th in both races in Brazil .
At the second meeting of the WTCC ( in Mexico ) , the SEAT team placed 1st , 4th , 6th , 7th and 11th in the first race .
While SEAT may have withdrawn from the BTCC , they are showing impressive results in the WTCC .
; " Cenit verde " projectThe Cenit VERDE initiative is a research project backed by the CENIT ( the National Strategic Consortia for Technical Research ) programme and supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation , in which SEAT plays a key role .

The company was founded in November 2005 almost five months after an initial agreement was signed between the Catalan government ( Generalitat ) , the Barcelona Port Authority and SEAT .
The budget for the project comes up to 6.8 million euro , while SEAT on its part also assumes the operational transport costs .

Adam Opel AG ( Opel ) is a German automobile manufacturer headquartered in Rüsselsheim , Hesse , Germany , and a subsidiary of General Motors Company .
= = History = = = = = 1862 @-@ 1920 = = = The company was founded in Rüsselsheim , Hessen , Germany , on January 21 , 1862 , by Adam Opel .
Because of the quick growth of his business , in 1888 the production was relocated from the cowshed to a more spacious building in Rüsselsheim .
In 1911 , the company 's factory was virtually destroyed by fire and a new one was built with more up @-@ to @-@ date machinery .
By 1914 , Opel had become the largest German manufacturer of motor vehicles .
The Laubfrosch was finished exclusively in green lacquer .
Adam Opel led the way for motorized transportation to become not just a means for the rich , but a reliable way for people of all classes to travel .
Opel had a 37.5 % market share in Germany and was also the country 's largest automobile exporter in 1928 .
This was based on the popular Opel " P4 " model .
They called the car , launched in 1935 , the Olympia .
Opel receives a patent which is considered one of the most important innovations in automotive history .
1939 saw the presentation of the highly successful Kapitän .
In spite of stifling red tape , the economic atmosphere in Germany in the 1930s had powerfully fertilized the growth of this and other auto companies .
One of the most versatile small German military vehicles , the Kettenkrad , a blend of tractor and motorcycle , was powered with a 1.4 L Olympia four @-@ cylinder engine .
To meet this demand , Opel engineers developed an unusual variation on normal cooling for the 3.6 L truck engine .
Of this interesting engine , which developed at 3,000 rpm on 74 @-@ octane fuel , only three examples were built .
Other special jobs were undertaken at the Rüsselsheim factory .
With work like this going on , Germany 's enemies naturally took note of the various Opel plants and , starting in August 1944 , began attacking them by air .
Never was the outlook more bleak at Adam Opel AG than in the first months of 1945 .
Cars as well as truck production lines were lost by Opel .
As reparations for war destruction , under plans of the Allied Forces , the Soviet Union asked the Allied Military Government for the tools , jigs , dies , fixtures , and drawings for the Kadett .
Just a year later a new Soviet car , the Moskvitch 400 , rolled off a Moscow assembly line .
Not until 1959 was a Moskvitch model introduced that bore no trace of Opel engineering .
And by that time , Opel was just about ready to introduce a new Kadett of its own .
But this ruling did not end our interest in , or responsibility for , the Opel property .
One resource that did not appear on the books of General Motors or on the rolls of the occupying authorities was most responsible for the recovery of Opel in 1945 : the collaborative nature of its workers .
By May 1945 , this work had advanced enough to allow the beginning of production of desperately needed Opel parts .
It was a minor miracle that even this was possible .
By January 1946 , the plant itself was ready to build trucks but many of the almost 12,000 parts needed to make each one were lacking .
Overcoming these and other obstacles , Opel finally celebrated the completion of the first postwar Opel Blitz truck on 15 July 1946 in the presence of U.S. Army General Geoffrey Keyes and other local leaders and press reporters .
With a ceremonial bouquet of flowers flying from its rear @-@ view mirror , this historic Opel Blitz left the factory gate bound for a buyer in Wiesbaden on 26 July .
Further production followed at a rate of 150 a month , and by the end of 1946 the production total was 839 .
Frigidaire refrigerators were also being made at Rüsselsheim , as were Olympia engines for the NSU Kettenkrad .
But occupation regulations restricted German civilians to cars of 1.5 L or less , which made the Olympia the obvious candidate .
Under Dr. Ing e.h. Karl Stief , who had been chief engineer at Opel since 1934 , useful changes were made to this tough little car .
Announced in November 1947 , production of the post @-@ war Olympia , with austere painted hubcaps , began in December 1948 and allowed a modest return to export sales in that year .
Prices in 1948 were 9950 DM for the Kapitan and 6,785 DM for the Olympia ( the Deutschmark having replaced the Reichsmark on 20 June 1948 ) .
In February and March , a GM study group came to Germany to investigate every aspect of Europe 's economic situation and Opel 's special problems .
On their return they submitted a report , on March 26 , recommending that General Motors resume control of Opel .
Such executives as Alfred P. Sloan Jr . , and Charles Wilson , GM 's President , then were considering the options .
Sloan set other important goals : " General Motors should risk no additional capital in Opel .
At last , the official word was released on 1 November 1948 : GM resumed management control of Adam Opel AG .
The appointment of Zdunek to this post was a move of special significance .
He continued in that critical position until 1961 .
The cabrio @-@ coach model was returned to the Olympia range and a kombi was also offered , built by Karosserie Miesen .
Bigger changes were saved for March 1951 , to anticipate the opening of the doors of the Frankfurt show on April 19 for an 11 @-@ day run .
This was a position that was not unfamiliar to both GM and Opel , and one in which it did amazingly well .
Opel 's first turbocharged car was the Opel Rekord 2.3 TD , first shown at Geneva in March 1984 .
Other plants are in Eisenach and Kaiserslautern , Germany ; Vienna / Aspern , Austria ; Szentgotthárd , Hungary ; Zaragoza , Spain ; Gliwice , and Tychy , Poland ; Saint Petersburg , Russia ; Tolyatti , Russia ; Ellesmere Port , and Luton , UK .
So Opel is in most cases fully responsible for all the car architectures and technologies up to the Opel Insignia / Buick Regal .
In particular , all the future @-@ oriented , modern , full @-@ efficient GM architectures for compact vehicles are developed by Opel .

Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter .
Like the stars , the spiral arms rotate around the center , but they do so with constant angular velocity .
Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years , a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy .
Starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars , including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions .
That is , a significant portion of the total energy output from the galaxy is emitted by a source other than the stars , dust and interstellar medium .
The standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) at the core region .
Possibly related to active galactic nuclei ( as well as starburst regions ) are low @-@ ionization nuclear emission @-@ line regions ( LINERs ) .
= = = Formation = = = Current cosmological models of the early Universe are based on the Big Bang theory .
About 300,000 years after this event , atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form , in an event called recombination .
As a result this period has been called the " Dark Ages . "
It was from density fluctuations ( or anisotropic irregularities ) in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear .
These primordial structures would eventually become the galaxies we see today .
During this early epoch , galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation .
During the following two billion years , the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc .
This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium .
Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies .
= = = Future trends = = = Spiral galaxies , like the Milky Way , produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms .
At the end of the stellar age , galaxies will be composed of compact objects : brown dwarfs , white dwarfs that are cooling or cold ( " black dwarfs " ) , neutron stars , and black holes .
Superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies , which are found in clusters , groups and sometimes individually .

The Alvar Aalto Museum , designed by Aalto himself , is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyväskylä .
= = Biography = = = = = Life = = = Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in Kuortane , Finland .
His father , Johan Henrik Aalto , was a Finnish @-@ speaking land @-@ surveyor and his mother , Selly ( Selma ) Matilda ( née Hackstedt ) was a Swedish @-@ speaking postmistress .
When Aalto was 5 years old , the family moved to Alajärvi , and from there to Jyväskylä in Central Finland .
In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology .
Afterwards , he continued his education , graduating in 1921 .
However , the Aaltos moved their office to Turku in 1927 , and started collaborating with architect Erik Bryggman .
The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki .
In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built a summer cottage in Alajärvi , Villa Flora .
Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949 .
In 1952 Aalto married architect Elissa Mäkiniemi ( died 1994 ) , who had been working as an assistant in his office .
In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage , the so @-@ called Experimental House , for himself and his new wife in Muuratsalo in Central Finland .
Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976 , in Helsinki , and is buried in the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki .
Furthermore , this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings , with articles for professional journals and newspapers .
Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works , they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring , synthetic attitude .
It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium ( 1932 ) and Viipuri Library ( 1935 ) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture .
It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client , and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design , inspiring them to be more daring in their work .
The original design was to include a private art gallery , but this was never built .
While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family , Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing .
Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy , giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material .
He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957 .
Aalto 's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of city planning and architecture to interior design , furniture and glassware design and painting .
He also has a few buildings in France , Germany , Italy and the USA .
These experiments also led to a number of patents : for example , he invented a new form of laminated bent @-@ plywood furniture in 1932 .
Aalto 's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935 , to great critical acclaim , and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto , together with his wife Aino , Maire Gullichsen and Nils @-@ Gustav Hahl founded the company Artek that same year .
Aalto glassware ( Aino as well as Alvar ) is manufactured by Iittala .
Everything else is at least for me an abuse of paper .

Meanwhile , Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus , another leading Caesarian .
Meanwhile , Octavian asked for a divorce from Clodia Pulchra , the daughter of Fulvia and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher .
Together with Lucius Antonius , she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony 's rights against Octavian .
Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia ( modern Perugia ) , where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC .

Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness , but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot .
= = = First settlement = = = In 27 BC , Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies .
According to H. H. Scullard , however , Augustus 's power was based on the exercise of " a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force , however much the fact was disguised .
Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces , but did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power .
The Senate still controlled North Africa , an important regional producer of grain , as well as Illyria and Macedonia , two martially strategic regions with several legions .
It was a title of religious rather than political authority .
Augustus also styled himself as " Imperator Caesar divi filius , " " Commander Caesar son of the deified one . "
With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar , but the use of " Imperator " signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory .
The word " Caesar " was merely a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family , yet Augustus transformed " Caesar " into a new family line that began with him .
This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor .
Legally it was closed to patricians , a status that Augustus had acquired years ago when adopted by Julius Caesar .
When Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC , fears arose once again that Augustus was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate .

After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC , Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa .
This union produced five children , three sons and two daughters : Gaius Caesar , Lucius Caesar , Vipsania Julia , Agrippina the Elder , and Postumus Agrippa , so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died .
While Drusus ' marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair , Vipsania was " only " the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage .
This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs .
He had composed an account of his achievements , the " Res Gestae Divi Augusti , " to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum .
Nevertheless , his legacy proved more enduring .
The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus , with Rome 's first institutionalized police force , fire fighting force , and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office .
A " praefectus vigilum , " or " Prefect of the Watch " was put in charge of the vigiles , Rome 's fire brigade and police .
With Rome 's civil wars at an end , Augustus was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire , fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers .
In the year 6 Augustus established the " aerarium militare , " donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers .
Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire , Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms .
In the year 29 BC , Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens , 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies , and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon .
As Tacitus wrote , the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate .
Had Augustus died earlier ( in 23 BC , for instance ) , matters might have turned out differently .
Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name , Caesar Augustus , which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title .

It is the same angular momentum one would obtain if there were just one particle of mass " M " moving at velocity v located at the center of mass .
= = Angular momentum ( modern definition ) = = In modern ( 20th century ) theoretical physics , angular momentum ( not including any intrinsic angular momentum - see below ) is described using a different formalism , instead of a classical pseudovector .
In each of the above cases , for a system of particles , the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta , and the centre of mass is for the system .
L is then an operator , specifically called the " orbital angular momentum operator . "
Finally , there is total angular momentum J , which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields .
However , it is very important in the microscopic world .
The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute , for example formula _ 46 .

Elephants are scattered throughout sub @-@ Saharan Africa , South Asia , and Southeast Asia .
Elephants ' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature .
Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years .
Elephants are used as working animals in Asia .
In the past they were used in war ; today , they are often put on display in zoos and circuses .
Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art , folklore , religion , literature and popular culture .
Traditionally , two species of elephants are recognised ; the African elephant ( " Loxodonta africana " ) of sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and the Asian elephant ( " Elephas maximus " ) of South and Southeast Asia .
In general , African elephants are larger than their Asian cousins .
English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940 .
Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial " Elephas maximus borneensis , " taking as his type an illustration in " National Geographic . "
Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000 years ago .
The African elephant was first named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as " Elephas africana . "
A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species ( " L. africana " and " L. cyclotis " respectively ) based on differences in skull morphology .
The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin , which have been suggested to be a separate species ( " Loxodonta pumilio " ) are probably forest elephants whose small size and / or early maturity are due to environmental conditions .
These animals were relatively small and aquatic .
The second radiation was represented by the emergence of the gomphotheres in the Miocene , which likely evolved from " Eritreum " and originated in Africa , spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica .
" Elephas " diversified into new species in Asia , such as " E. hysudricus " and " E. platycephus " ; the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant .
Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader .
The skull grew larger , especially the cranium , while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull .
= = = = Dwarf species = = = = Several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism .
Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in Indonesia , the Channel Islands of California , and several islands of the Mediterranean .
In both cases , males are larger than females .
Among African elephants , the forest form is smaller than the savannah form .
African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs , while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs .
The lower jaw is solid and heavy .
Because of the size of the head , the neck is relatively short to provide better support .
Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light .
Of all the elephants , African bush elephants live in the hottest climates , and have the largest ear flaps .
Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz .
It contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles , with no bone and little fat .
An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding of water in its trunk .
The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant 's lifetime .
Instead , new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones .
As a piece of living tissue , a tusk is relatively soft ; it is as hard as the mineral calcite .
They are used for digging for water , salt , and roots ; debarking or marking trees ; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path .
When fighting , they are used to attack and defend , and to protect the trunk .
The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or " cushion pads " beneath the manus or pes , which distribute the weight of the animal .
= = = Internal and sexual organs = = = The brain of an elephant weighs compared to for a human brain .
This organ is associated with sexual behaviour , and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth .
Forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests , but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs .
They can consume as much as of food and of water in a day .
Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food , water and mates .
At Mount Elgon , elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates , hyraxes , bats , birds and insects .
In Asian forests , large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal .
Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems .
At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda , the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands .
Elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores , which will usually stay out of their way .
Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded .
At Aberdare National Park , Kenya , a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group .
= = = Social organisation = = = The social lives of male and female elephants are very different .
The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision @-@ makers .
The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit .
There are typically nine groups in a clan .
Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations .
Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring .
These groups appear to interact with each other , especially at forest clearings .
The life of the adult male is very different .
When males do leave , they either live alone or with other males .
This can last from a day to four months .
Thus these bulls have more reproductive success .
= = = Birthing and calves = = = Gestation in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years .
For the first few days , the newborn is unsteady on its feet , and needs the support of its mother .
For its first three months , a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water .
At the same time , improvements in lip and leg coordination occur .
By nine months , mouth , trunk and foot coordination is perfected .
It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year .
The former are sexually mature by the age of nine years while the latter become mature around 14 @-@ 15 years .
Lin Wang , a captive male Asian elephant , lived for 86 years .
= = = Communication = = = Touching is an important form of communication among elephants .
Infrasonic calls are important , particularly for long @-@ distance communication , in both Asian and African elephants .
One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs .
Elephants are among the species known to use tools .
In 1979 , Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants , with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million .
By 1989 , the population was estimated to be 609,000 ; with 277,000 in Central Africa , 110,000 in eastern Africa , 204,000 in southern Africa , and 19,000 in western Africa .
About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests , fewer than had previously been thought .
African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found , but 70 % of their range exists outside protected areas .
Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities .
In 1989 , the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , making trade illegal .
In some countries , sport hunting of the animals is legal ; Botswana , Cameroon , Gabon , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Tanzania , Zambia , and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies .
It is now extinct in these areas , and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented .
It is likely that around half of the population is in India .
This prompted international bans on ivory imports , starting with the United States in June 1989 , and followed by bans in other North American countries , western European countries , and Japan .
Around the same time , Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks .
By contrast , Japan and Hong Kong , which were also part of the industry , were able to adapt and were not badly affected .
In January 2012 , hundreds of elephants in Bouba Njida National Park , Cameroon , were killed by Chadian raiders .
Still , members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas , such as Periyar National Park in India .
The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations .
In northern Thailand , the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee .
From South Asia , the use of elephants in warfare spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia .
From then on , war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period .
= = = Zoos and circuses = = = Elephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of Ancient Egypt , China , Greece and Rome .
In the modern era , elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world .
The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo ( 1861 - 15 September 1885 ) , who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus .
As of 2000 , around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses .
The largest captive population is in North America , which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants .
About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe , and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans .
Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress .
Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device , known as a hot shot or electric prod , on an elephant .
In 2012 , two elephants in Tete d 'Or zoo , Lyon were diagnosed with the disease .
Because of the timing , these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive .
In India , male elephants regularly enter villages at night , destroying homes and killing people .
Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand , while in Assam 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006 .
Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks , although officials have disputed this explanation .
Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002 , killing six people , which led to the killing of about 200 elephants by locals .
Africa in particular contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals , especially in the Sahara and southern Africa .
In the Far East , the animals are depicted as motifs in Hindu and Buddhist shrines and temples .
Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs .
The animals ' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia .

At a distance of 2.6 parsecs ( 8.6 ly ) , as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite , the Sirius system is one of Earth 's near neighbors .
Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ( ) and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42 .
It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel .
This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf , the second to be discovered .
The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer .
The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer Thomas Barker , squire of Lyndon Hall in Rutland , who prepared a paper and spoke at a meeting of the Royal Society in London in 1760 .
Thomas Jefferson Jackson See resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892 , and a final summary in 1926 .
Seneca , too , had described Sirius as being of a deeper red color than Mars .
The orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3 arcseconds and a maximum of 11 arcseconds .
At a distance of 2.6 parsecs ( 8.6 ly ) , the Sirius system contains two of the eight nearest stars to the Solar System ( not including the Sun ) , and is the fifth closest stellar system to ours ( again not including the Sun ) .
Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum , Sirius B was once the more massive of the two .

The Andean condor ( " Vultur gryphus " ) is a South American bird in the New World vulture family Cathartidae and is the only member of the genus Vultur .
It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and , especially in the male , large white patches on the wings .
In the male , there is a wattle on the neck and a large , dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head .
Unlike most birds of prey , the male is larger than the female .
The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird , and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene , allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes .
In the early 19th century , the Andean condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego , along the entire chain of the Andes , but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity .

Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) and its predecessor , Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) , are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network .
This session key is then used to encrypt data flowing between the parties .
This allows for data / message confidentiality , and message authentication codes for message integrity and as a by @-@ product , message authentication .
As a consequence of choosing X.509 certificates , certificate authorities and a public key infrastructure are necessary to verify the relation between a certificate and its owner , as well as to generate , sign , and administer the validity of certificates .
In the Internet Protocol Suite , TLS and SSL encrypt the data of network connections in the application layer .
In OSI model equivalences , TLS / SSL is initialized at layer 5 ( session layer ) and works at layer 6 ( the presentation layer ) .
In both models , TLS and SSL work on behalf of the underlying transport layer , whose segments carry encrypted data .
TLS is an Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) standards track protocol , first defined in 1999 and updated in RFC 5246 ( August 2008 ) and RFC 6176 ( March 2011 ) .
One option is to use a different port number for TLS connections ( for example , port 443 for HTTPS ) .

However the size of the hash in the finished message is still truncated to 96 bits .
= = = TLS 1.3 ( draft ) = = = , TLS 1.3 is a draft , and details have not been established yet .
It is based on the earlier TLS 1.1 and 1.2 specification .
Major differences from TLS 1.2 include : * Reworked handshake to provide 1 @-@ RTT mode .
* Removed support for static RSA and DH key exchange .
Only TLS _ DHE and TLS _ ECDHE provide forward secrecy .
HMAC is used for CBC mode of block ciphers and stream ciphers .
AEAD is used for Authenticated encryption such as GCM mode and CCM mode .
However , it has also been implemented with datagram @-@ oriented transport protocols , such as the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol ( DCCP ) , usage which has been standardized independently using the term Datagram Transport Layer Security ( DTLS ) .
; Notes = = = Web browsers = = = , the latest versions of all major web browsers support TLS 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2 , have them enabled by default .

* SSL 2.0 has a weak MAC construction that uses the MD5 hash function with a secret prefix , making it vulnerable to length extension attacks .
* SSL 2.0 uses the TCP connection close to indicate the end of data .
This means that most websites are practically impaired from using SSL .

Althusser was a brilliant student at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and was later accepted by the elite École Normale Supérieure ( ENS ) in Paris .
= = = Health = = = After the war , Althusser was able to finally attend ENS .
Althusser remained in hospital until 1983 .
He died of a heart attack on 22 October 1990 at the age of 72 .
The current English edition of this work includes only the essays of Althusser and Étienne Balibar , while the original French edition contains additional contributions from Jacques Rancière , Pierre Macherey , and Roger Establet .
These structures , for Althusser , are both agents of repression and inevitable : it is impossible to escape ideology and avoid being subjected to it .
Marx 's theory seems to posit a system in which an imbalance in two parts could lead to compensatory adjustments at other levels , or sometimes to a major reorganisation of the whole .
To develop this idea , Althusser relies on the concepts of contradiction and non @-@ contradiction , which he claims are illuminated by their relation to a complex structured whole .
Althusser elaborates on these concepts by reference to Lenin 's analysis of the Russian Revolution of 1917 .
The differences between events in Russia and Western Europe highlight that a contradiction between forces and relations of production may be necessary , but not sufficient , to bring about revolution .
To emphasise that changes in social structures relate to numerous contradictions , Althusser describes these changes as " overdetermined , " using a term taken from Sigmund Freud .
However , Althusser does not mean to say that the events that determine social changes all have the same causal status .
For Althusser , the economic practice of a society determines which other aspect of that society dominates the society as a whole .
For Althusser , however , a person 's capacity for perceiving him or herself in this way is not innate or given .
Rather , it is acquired within the structure of established social practices , which impose on individuals the role ( " forme " ) of a subject .
However , other characteristics of individuals , such as their beliefs about the good life or their metaphysical reflections on the nature of the self , do not easily fit into these categories .
Despite its many institutional forms , the function and structure of ideology is unchanging and present throughout history ; as Althusser states , " ideology has no history . "
All ideologies constitute a subject , even though he or she may differ according to each particular ideology .
The " transformation " of an individual into a subject has always already happened ; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza 's theory of immanence .

If a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non @-@ specific response .
Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals .
Here , the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen .
Chemical barriers also protect against infection .
Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released .
Complement is the major humoral component of the innate immune response .
Many species have complement systems , including non @-@ mammals like plants , fish , and some invertebrates .
This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response .
This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback .
= = = Cellular barriers = = = Leukocytes ( white blood cells ) act like independent , single @-@ celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system .
Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 .
Mast cells reside in connective tissues and mucous membranes , and regulate the inflammatory response .
Natural killer ( NK cells ) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells , or cells that have been infected by viruses .
Should a pathogen infect the body more than once , these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it .
= = = Lymphocytes = = = The cells of the adaptive immune system are special types of leukocytes , called lymphocytes .
B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow .
B cells are involved in the humoral immune response , whereas T cells are involved in cell @-@ mediated immune response .
Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets .
There are two major subtypes of T cells : the killer T cell and the helper T cell .
Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules , while helper T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules .
These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell .
A third , minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors .
In contrast , the B cell antigen @-@ specific receptor is an antibody molecule on the B cell surface , and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for antigen processing .
= = = = Killer T cells = = = = Killer T cells are a sub @-@ group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses ( and other pathogens ) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional .
As with B cells , each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen .
Recognition of this MHC : antigen complex is aided by a co @-@ receptor on the T cell , called CD8 .
The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen .
When an activated T cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter .
T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses .
T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC / antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by " helper " T cells ( see below ) .
= = = = Helper T cells = = = = Helper T cells regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help determine which immune responses the body makes to a particular pathogen .
They instead control the immune response by directing other cells to perform these tasks .
Helper T cells express T cell receptors ( TCR ) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules .
The MHC : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's CD4 co @-@ receptor , which recruits molecules inside the T cell ( e.g. , Lck ) that are responsible for the T cell 's activation .
Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells .
For example , large numbers of human Vγ9 / Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted Vδ1 + T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells .
= = = = B lymphocytes and antibodies = = = = A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen .
This antigen / antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides .
The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules .
This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell .
= = = Immunological memory = = = When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long @-@ lived memory cells .
Throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again .
Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother .
This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies - it only borrows them .
This passive immunity is usually short @-@ term , lasting from a few days up to several months .
In medicine , protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody @-@ rich serum .
= = = = Active memory and immunization = = = = Long @-@ term " active " memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells .
Active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination .
With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population , vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed .
= = = Immunodeficiencies = = = Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive .
= = = Hypersensitivity = = = Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues .
This is also called antibody @-@ dependent ( or cytotoxic ) hypersensitivity , and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies .
Immune complexes ( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and IgG and IgM antibodies ) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions .
These reactions are mediated by T cells , monocytes , and macrophages .
Unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant .
Systemic acquired resistance ( SAR ) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent .
= = Tumor immunology = = Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors .
To the immune system , these antigens appear foreign , and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells .
A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival , that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes .
The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells .
Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens .
This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal .
NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors .
Clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers .
Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer T cells .
Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF @-@ β , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes .
In addition , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells .
Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells .
However , the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes toxic side effects .
= = Predicting immunogenicity = = Larger drugs ( > 500 Da ) can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses .
This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins ( which are typically larger than 6000 Da ) .
In some cases , the drug itself is not immunogenic , but may be co @-@ administered with an immunogenic compound , as is sometimes the case for Taxol .
Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type II secretion system .
Other bacteria , such as " Mycobacterium tuberculosis , " live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement .
Such biofilms are present in many successful infections , e.g. , the chronic " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and " Burkholderia cenocepacia " infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis .
Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective ; examples include " Streptococcus " ( protein G ) , " Staphylococcus aureus " ( protein A ) , and " Peptostreptococcus magnus " ( protein L ) .
The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated .
The simplest approach is to rapidly change non @-@ essential epitopes ( amino acids and / or sugars ) on the surface of the pathogen , while keeping essential epitopes concealed .
These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus .

The first international tournament , the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship , took place in 1884 .
After FIFA was founded in 1904 , it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906 .
Planned by The Football Association ( FA ) , England 's football governing body , the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition .
Great Britain ( represented by the England national amateur football team ) won the gold medals .
Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928 .
Those were also the first two open world championships , as 1924 was the start of FIFA 's professional era .
On 28 May 1928 , the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself .
In total , 13 nations took part : seven from South America , four from Europe and two from North America .
In the final , Uruguay defeated Argentina 4 @-@ 2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in Montevideo , and in doing so became the first nation to win the World Cup .
Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments , with Brazil the only South American team to compete in both .
= = = World Cups after World War II = = = The 1950 World Cup , held in Brazil , was the first to include British participants .
Nevertheless , European and South American teams continue to dominate , e.g. , the quarter @-@ finalists in 1994 , 1998 , and 2006 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far .
The experts of FIFA , coming from seven countries , evaluated the 53 presented models , finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga .
They are held within the six FIFA continental zones ( Africa , Asia , North and Central America and Caribbean , South America , Oceania , and Europe ) , overseen by their respective confederations .
This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002 , but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward , requiring the champions to qualify .
Since 1994 , three points have been awarded for a win , one for a draw and none for a loss ( before , winners received two points ) .
The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay , for example , led to only four European nations competing .
The next two World Cups were both held in Europe .
England ( 1966 ) and France ( 1998 ) won their only titles while playing as host nations .
Uruguay ( 1930 ) , Italy ( 1934 ) and Argentina ( 1978 ) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again , while Germany ( 1974 ) won their second title on home soil .
So far , South Africa ( 2010 ) was the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round .
The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion .
European nations have won 11 titles ; South American teams have won nine .

= = Description = = The Bridge of the Americas crosses the Pacific approach to the Panama Canal at Balboa , near Panama City .
It was built between 1959 and 1962 by the United States at a cost of 20 million U.S. dollars .
The highest point of the bridge is 117 m ( 384 ft ) above mean sea level ; the clearance under the main span is 61.3 m ( 201 ft ) at high tide .
The bridge is an impressive sight , and a good view can be obtained from the Balboa Yacht Club , where many small boats tie up before or after transiting the canal .
Throughout the day and night numerous vessels pass under the bridge , either entering or departing from the Panama Canal .
This was an issue even during construction , when barges were used to ferry construction workers across the canal .
After the canal opened , the increasing number of cars , and the construction of a new road leading to Chiriquí , in the west of Panama , increased the need for some kind of crossing .
The Panama Canal Mechanical Division addressed this in August 1931 , with the commissioning of two new ferries , the " Presidente Amador " and " President Washington .
" This service was expanded in August 1940 , with additional barges mainly serving the military .
Still , it was clear that a more substantial solution would be required .
To meet the growing needs of vehicle traffic , another ferry , the " Presidente Porras , " was added in November 1942 .
= = = The Bridge Project = = = The idea of a permanent bridge over the canal had been proposed as a major priority as early as 1923 .
Construction began on October 12 , 1959 , and took nearly two and a half years to complete .
The inauguration of the bridge took place on October 12 , 1962 , with great ceremony .
The ribbon was cut by Maurice H. Thatcher , after which those present were allowed to walk across the bridge .
The bridge therefore became a significant bottleneck on the highway , which led to the construction of the Centennial Bridge , which now carries the Pan @-@ American Highway too .
Said name will be used exclusively to identify said bridge .

Salam was a science advisor to the Government of Pakistan from 1960 to 1974 , a position from which he played a major and influential role in Pakistan 's science infrastructure .
Salam was responsible for not only major developments and contributions in theoretical and particle physics , but also for promoting scientific research to maximum levels in his country .
Salam was the founding director of Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission ( SUPARCO ) , and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group ( TPG ) in Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PAEC ) .
In 1998 , following the country 's nuclear tests , the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp , as a part of " Scientists of Pakistan , " to honour the services of Salam .
Salam heavily contributed to the rise of Pakistani physics to the Physics community in the world .
Salam 's father was an education officer in the Department of Education of Punjab State in a poor farming district .
His father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service .
in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946 .
Salam returned to Jhang , Punjab ( now part of Pakistan ) and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate .
His doctoral thesis contained comprehensive and fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics .
During his doctoral studies , his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as Dirac and Feynman .
Within six months , Salam had found a solution for the renormalisation of meson theory .
As he proposed the solution at the Cavendish Laboratory , Salam had attracted the attention of Bethe , Oppenheimer and Dirac .
As he became the chairman , Salam sought to update the university curriculum , making a course of Quantum mechanics as a part of undergraduate course .
This was soon reverted by the Vice @-@ Chancellor , and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the regular curriculum .
As a result , Riazuddin remained the only student of Salam who has the privilege to study under Salam at the under @-@ graduate and post @-@ graduate level in Lahore , and Post @-@ doctoral level in Cambridge University .
In 1953 , Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore , as he faced strong opposition from his peers .
In 1954 , Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences .
In 1957 , Punjab University conferred Salam with an Honorary doctorate for his contribution in Particle physics .
The same year with help from his mentor , Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan .
Salam retained strong links with Pakistan , and visited his country from time to time .
At Cambridge and Imperial College he formed a group of theoretical physicists , the majority of whom were his Pakistani students .
Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics , problems and their solution .
His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley .
In 1980 , Salam became a foreign fellow of the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences .
= = = Scientific career = = = Early in his career , Salam made an important and significant contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory , including its extension into particle and nuclear physics .
In his early career in Pakistan , Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics .
Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics , but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics .
However , he regarded nuclear physics ( nuclear fission and nuclear power ) as a non @-@ pioneering part of physics as it had already " happened . "
Even in Pakistan , Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics in Pakistan , with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics .
Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high @-@ energy physics .
Salam had worked on theory of the neutrino - an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930s .
Salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos .
Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin , who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos .
Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model , where he later predicted the existence of proton decay .
In 1963 , Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson .
The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson , photon ( vector electrodynamics ) , and the renormalization of vector mesons ' known mass after the interaction .
In 1961 , Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and Electroweak unification .
In 1964 , Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction , subsequently obtaining SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) model .
Salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the Gauge interactions .
In 1968 , together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow , Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work .
While in Imperial College , Salam , along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone , mathematically proved the Goldstone 's theorem , that a massless spin @-@ zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry .
In 1960 , Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow 's discovery , giving a it a modern form in electroweak theory , and thus theorised the Standard Model .
In 1968 , together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow , Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work .
In 1966 , Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle .
Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C @-@ violation , thus he formulated the magnetic photon .
Following the publication of PRL Symmetry Breaking papers in 1964 , Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to apply the Higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking .
Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory .
In 1972 , Salam began to work with Indian @-@ American theoretical physicist Jogesh Pati .
Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam 's direction , in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan .
Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge .
Protons carry quarks , but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos , with nothing postulated about quarks .
If all of nature 's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry , it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel .
In 1973 , Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since Quarks and Leptons have very similar SU ( 2 ) × U ( 1 ) representation content , they all may have similar entities .
Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature : the gravitational force , the strong and weak nuclear forces , and the electromagnetic force .
Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg .
While at Imperial College London , Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces , and two could inter @-@ convert .
Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature , weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces , one into another .
In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory .
= = Government work = = Abdus Salam immediately returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post that was given to him by President Field Marshal Ayub Khan .
Even the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PAEC ) headquarters was located in a small room , and less than 10 scientists were working on a fundamental concepts of physics .
Abdus Salam expanded the web of physics research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad .
In September 1961 , Abdus Salam approached President Ayub Khan to set up the country 's first national space agency .
On 16 September 1961 , through an executive order , Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission was established , in which Abdus Salam served as the first director .
Before 1960 , very little work on scientific development was done , and scientific activities in Pakistan were almost diminished .
Abdus Salam called Ishfaq Ahmad , a nuclear physicist , who had left the country for Switzerland where he joined CERN , to Pakistan .
In 1967 , Abdus Salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in both Theoretical and Particle physics .
With the establishment of Institute of Physics at Quaid @-@ e @-@ Azam University , the research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged .
Another physicist , Raziuddin Siddiqui , established numerous physics research group and supervised research activities in the academic institutions of Pakistan .
Under the direction of Abdus Salam , research in physics reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of Pakistani physicists .
Abdus Salam moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building , and established research laboratories all over the country .
On the direction of Abdus Salam , Ishrat Hussain Usmani set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country .
In October 1961 , Abdus Salam travelled to the United States and signed a space @-@ cooperation agreement between Pakistan and United States .
on November 1961 , NASA started to build a space facility - Flight Test Range - in Balochistan where Abdus Salam served as its first technical director .
Abdus Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan 's development in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
The same year , Abdus Salam joined Munir Ahmad Khan - Abdus Salam 's lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University .
Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Abdus Salam had consulted about the establishment of International Centre for Theoretical Physics , a research physics institution , in Trieste , Italy .
At IAEA , Abdus Salam had tirelessly advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country .
It was due to his effort that in 1965 , Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy cooperation deal .
In 1965 , with the efforts led by Abdus Salam , the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which th U.S. provided Pakistan with a small research reactor .
Abdus Salam had a long dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan , for which he had advocated on many different occasions .
In 1965 , Abdus Salam and Edward Durrell Stone signed a contract for the establishment of Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology at Nilore , Islamabad .
In November 1961 , NASA built Flight Test Center ( FTC ) in Balochistan Province .
During this time , Salam visited Air Force Academy where he met with Air Commodore ( Brigadier @-@ General ) Wladyslaw Turowicz - a Polish military scientist and an aerospace engineer .
Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space center , and a programme of rocket testing ensued .
In 1964 , while in the United States , Salam visited the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , and met with nuclear engineers Salim Mehmud and Tariq Mustafa .
Salam signed another agreement with National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) in which NASA launched a programme to provide training to Pakistan 's scientists and engineers .
Both nuclear engineers returned to Pakistan in few months and were inducted in Suparco .
= = = Nuclear weapons programme = = = Salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in Pakistan , for civilian and peaceful purposes .
But , according to his biographers , Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan 's own integrated atomic bomb project .
As late as the 1960s , Salam made an unsuccessful attempt for a proposal for the establishment of nuclear fuel reprocessing plant , but it was deferred the matter on economic grounds by Ayub Khan .
According to Rehman , Salam 's influence in nuclear development was lessened and diminished as late as 1974 , and he became critical of Bhutto 's control over science .
But Salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at PAEC .
In 1965 , Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute - Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology .
In 1965 , the plutonium reactor Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor went critical under the leadership of Salam .
In 1973 , Salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college in order to promote scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC , Munir Ahmad Khan , who wholeheartedly accepted and fully supported this idea .
The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics .
In November 1971 , Salam met with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in his residence , and following Bhutto 's advice , Salam went to United States to avoid the 1971 Indo @-@ Pak winter war .
In 1971 , Salam had travelled to the United States and returned to Pakistan with scientific literature about the Manhattan Project , and calculations involving in atomic bombs .
In 1972 , the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the Indian nuclear programme .
In 20 January 1972 , at the Multan meeting , Bhutto orchestrated to develop the deterrence programme .
Former Prime minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , formed a group of scientists and engineers , which was first headed by Salam .
At this meeting , only I.H.
After the meeting , Salam established the " Theoretical Physics Group ( TPG ) " " in PAEC .
Abdus had led groundbreaking work at the TPG and was initially headed by Salam until 1974 .
Salam immediately started to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with PAEC in the development of fission weapons .
In December 1972 , two theoretical physicists working at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics were asked by Salam to report to Munir Ahmad Khan , the scientific director of the program .
This marked the beginning of the " Theoretical Physics Group ( TPG ) , " reporting directly to Salam .
Later , the Theoretical Physics Group working under the leadership of Riazuddin , who was also Salam 's student , began to directly report to Salam , and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon device was completed in 1977 .
The DTD was set up to coordinate the work of the various specialized groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb .
On March 1974 , Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist that was charged with manufacturing materials , explosive lenses and triggering mechanism development of the weapon .
Thus , the Wah Group working under the DTD was charged with the material and triggering mechanism development of the weapon .
Salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until the mid @-@ 1974 , when he left the country after Ahmadi were declared non @-@ Muslims by the Pakistani Parliament .
In spite of this , Salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed about every status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb , according to Norman Dombey .
In 1980s , Salam personally approved many appointments and a large influx of Pakistani scientists to the associateship program at ICTP and CERN , and engaged in research in theoretical physics with his students at the ICTP .
In 2008 , Indian scholar Ravi Singh noted in his book that " in 1978 , Abdus Salam with PAEC officials , paid a secret visit to China , and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries .
The INSC is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world to come to Pakistan and hold discussions on different aspects of physics and science .
Even today , the INSC holds an annual meetings , and Salam 's pupil student Riazuddin is its director since its inception .
In 1997 , the scientists at ICPT commemorated Salam and renamed ICTP as " Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics . "
Salam had advocated for development of Science in third world countries , and attended various seminars in different countries .
Throughout the years , Salam served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries .
Salam also founded the Third World Academy of Sciences ( TWAS ) and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology .
Although Salam had departed from Pakistan , he did not terminate his connection to Pakistan .
Salam continued inviting Pakistan 's scientists to ICTP , and maintained a research programme for the Pakistani scientists .
= = Personal life = = Salam was a very private individual , who kept his public and personal lives quite separate .
= = = Religion = = = Salam was " known to be a devout Muslim , " and was a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community who saw his religion as fundamental part of his scientific work .
In protest , Salam left Pakistan for London .

The British Empire was territorially enlarged : from France , Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia , and from Spain , Gibraltar and Minorca .
The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith 's view that political control was not necessary for economic success .
Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia .

However , in 1998 , a team successfully climbed a subsidiary peak of the mountain from Tibet .
Kula Kangri , 7,554 metres , is a separate mountain 30 km to the northeast which was first climbed in 1986 .
It is variously mapped and described as being in Tibet or Bhutan .
Since 1994 climbing of mountains in Bhutan higher than 6,000 metres has been prohibited out of respect for local spiritual beliefs , and since 2003 mountaineering has been forbidden completely .
Gangkhar Puensum may keep its unique status for some time : any higher unclimbed peaks in the world are likely to be subsidiary tops , not separate mountains .
In 1998 a Japanese expedition secured permission from the Chinese Mountaineering Association to climb the mountain , but permission was withdrawn because of a political issue with Bhutan .
Instead , in 1999 , the team set off from Tibet and successfully climbed the 7,535 metre subsidiary peak Liankang Kangri ( also known as Gangkhar Puensum North ) .

In these reactions , the molecules at the beginning of the process are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules , called products .
Some enzymes are used commercially , for example , in the synthesis of antibiotics .
He wrote that " alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells , not with the death or putrefaction of the cells .
The word " enzyme " was used later to refer to nonliving substances such as pepsin , and the word " ferment " was used to refer to chemical activity produced by living organisms .
In 1907 , he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for " his discovery of cell @-@ free fermentation . "
In 1926 , James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it ; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937 .
These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
Like all proteins , enzymes are linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three @-@ dimensional structure .
Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and expression of the genome .
Here , an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step .
This two @-@ step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high @-@ fidelity mammalian polymerases .
This is often referred to as " the lock and key " model .
In some cases , such as glycosidases , the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site .
Cofactors can be either inorganic ( e.g. , metal ions and iron @-@ sulfur clusters ) or organic compounds ( e.g. , flavin and heme ) .
These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis .
In the presence of an enzyme , the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme , just more quickly .
For example , the hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions .
The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages .
This is sometimes called the Michaelis @-@ Menten complex in their honor .
The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product .
This is shown in the saturation curve on the right .
At the maximum reaction rate ( " V " max ) of the enzyme , all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate , and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme .
" V " max is only one of several important kinetic parameters .
The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important .
This is a form of negative feedback .
Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport .
Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions , such as luciferase generating light in fireflies .
An important function of enzymes is in the digestive systems of animals .
In a metabolic pathway , one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate .
Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells .
One example of enzyme deficiency is the most common type of phenylketonuria .
Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are less able to repair mutations in their genomes .
Examples are lactase , alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase .
= = Industrial applications = = Enzymes are used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required .

Californium is a radioactive metallic chemical element with symbol Cf and atomic number 98 .
The element was first made in 1950 at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , by bombarding curium with alpha particles ( helium @-@ 4 ions ) .
Californium @-@ 252 , with a half @-@ life of about 2.64 years , is the most common isotope used and is produced at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia .
The α form exists below with a density of 15.10 g / cm3 and the β form exists above 900 ° C with a density of 8.74 g / cm3 .
The bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure .
The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature , with the rate increasing when moisture is added .
Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment , and these atoms had a half @-@ life of 44 minutes .
" Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at the Materials Testing Reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho ; and these findings were reported in 1954 .
The High Flux Isotope Reactor ( HFIR ) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) in Oak Ridge , Tennessee , started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s .
Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249 , 252 , 253 , and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion .
Only two sites produce californium @-@ 252 - the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States , and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad , Russia .
As of 2003 , the two sites produce 0.25 grams and 0.025 grams of californium @-@ 252 per year , respectively .
It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119 µg of californium @-@ 252 from the Savannah River Plant .
Californium @-@ 251 has a very small calculated critical mass ( about ) , high lethality , and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation .

As an alkali metal , it has one valence electron .
Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France ( from which the element takes its name ) in 1939 .
It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid , and with perchloric acid , without another alkali metal as a carrier , which provides other methods of separation .
It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistryand of atomic structure .
These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles .
= = History = = As early as 1870 , chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium , with an atomic number of 87 .
= = = Erroneous and incomplete discoveries = = = Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka @-@ caesium , or francium .
He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka @-@ caesium , in which he named the element " russium " after his home country .
The following year , English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X @-@ ray photographs of manganese ( II ) sulfate .
They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name " alkalinium , " as it would be the heaviest alkali metal .
In 1937 , Hulubei 's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr . , who rejected Hulubei 's research methods .
Because of this , Jean Baptiste Perrin , Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei 's mentor , endorsed moldavium as the true eka @-@ caesium over Marguerite Perey 's recently discovered francium .
Further research into francium 's structure was carried out by , among others , Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s .
It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the Earth 's crust at any given time .
= = Isotopes = = There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 199 to 232 .
Francium @-@ 223 is the most stable isotope , with a half @-@ life of 21.8 minutes , and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half @-@ life will ever be discovered or synthesized .
Francium @-@ 223 then decays into radium @-@ 223 by beta decay ( 1149 keV decay energy ) , with a minor ( 0.006 % ) alpha decay path to astatine @-@ 219 ( 5.4 MeV decay energy ) .

Francium @-@ 221 then decays into astatine @-@ 217 by alpha decay ( 6.457 MeV decay energy ) .
Radium , in the form of radium chloride , was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in 1898 .
Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22 .
Titanium was discovered in Cornwall , Great Britain , by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology .
The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores via the Kroll process or the Hunter process .
Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride ( TiCl4 ) , a component of smoke screens and catalysts ; and titanium trichloride ( TiCl3 ) , which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene .
Titanium is fairly hard ( although not as hard as some grades of heat @-@ treated steel ) , non @-@ magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity .
Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey , 784 contained titanium .
Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5 % .
Of these minerals , only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance , yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations .
Significant titanium @-@ bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia , Canada , China , India , Mozambique , New Zealand , Norway , Ukraine and South Africa .
Rocks brought back from the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission are composed of 12.1 % TiO2 .
It is also found in coal ash , plants , and even the human body .
Via the Kroll process , TiCl4 is produced in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide , e.g. , for use in white paint .
In this process , the chlorine gas is passed over a red @-@ hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon .

The GNU Debugger , usually called just GDB and named " gdb " as an executable file , is the standard debugger for the GNU operating system .
= = History = = GDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system , after his GNU Emacs was " reasonably stable . "
From 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by John Gilmore while he worked for Cygnus Solutions .
Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another .
GDB can communicate to the remote ' stub ' which understands GDB protocol via Serial or TCP / IP .
The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb .
With KGDB , kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs .
KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or ethernet .

Gramsci was in Turin as it was going through industrialization , with the Fiat and Lancia factories recruiting workers from poorer regions .
Gramsci joined the Italian Socialist Party in late 1913 .
At university , he had come into contact with the thought of Antonio Labriola , Rodolfo Mondolfo , Giovanni Gentile and , most importantly , Benedetto Croce , possibly the most widely respected Italian intellectual of his day .
Though Gramsci would later use this phrase to escape the prison censors , his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life .
An articulate and prolific writer of political theory , Gramsci proved a formidable commentator , writing on all aspects of Turin 's social and political life .
In April 1919 with Togliatti , Angelo Tasca and Umberto Terracini Gramsci set up the weekly newspaper " L 'Ordine Nuovo " ( The New Order ) .
The " L 'Ordine Nuovo " group was seen by Vladimir Lenin as closest in orientation to the Bolsheviks , and it received his backing against the anti @-@ parliamentary programme of the extreme left Amadeo Bordiga .
= = = In the Communist Party of Italy = = = The failure of the workers ' councils to develop into a national movement led Gramsci to believe that a Communist Party in the Leninist sense was needed .
In 1922 Gramsci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party .
At its Lyon Congress in January 1926 , Gramsci 's theses calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party .
Togliatti , in Moscow as a representative of the party , received the letter , opened it , read it , and decided not to deliver it .
This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved .
He received an immediate sentence of 5 years in confinement on the island of Ustica and the following year he received a sentence of 20 years of prison in Turi , near Bari .
In 1934 he gained conditional freedom on health grounds , after visiting hospitals in Civitavecchia , Formia and Rome .
= = Thought = = Gramsci was one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the twentieth century , and a particularly key thinker in the development of Western Marxism .
He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment .
Gramsci stated that bourgeois cultural values were tied to folklore , popular culture and religion , and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these .
For Gramsci , Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people 's spiritual needs , and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience .
= = = Intellectuals and education = = = Gramsci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society .
Famously , he stated that all men are intellectuals , in that all have intellectual and rational faculties , but not all men have the social function of intellectuals .
Such " organic " intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules , but instead articulate , through the language of culture , the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves .
For this reason , partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day .
He stresses , however , that the division is purely conceptual and that the two , in reality , often overlap .
Gramsci proffers that under modern capitalism , the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere .
Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism , as well as the ' scientific management ' and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively , are examples of this .
In Gramsci 's view , all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity ( or " praxis " ) and the " objective " historical and social processes of which it is a part .
This anti @-@ scientistic and anti @-@ positivist stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce .
For Gramsci , Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself , independent of humanity .
Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history .

The new government formed the Red Army to fight various enemies in the Russian Civil War .
In World War II , it was the major military force in the defeat of Nazi Germany .
After the war , it occupied East Germany , and many nations in central and eastern Europe , which became satellite states in the Soviet bloc .
The Cold War between the two nations led to military buildups , the nuclear arms race , and the Space Race .
The Soviet military consisted of five armed services .
In their official order of importance , the Soviet armed services were the Strategic Rocket Forces , Ground Forces , Air Forces , Air Defense Forces , and Naval Forces .
It was the biggest defeat of the Red Army in history .
After the civil war , the Red Army became an increasingly professional military organization .
With most of its five million soldiers demobilized , the Red Army was transformed into a small regular force , and territorial militias were created for wartime mobilization .
Soviet military schools , established during the civil war , began to graduate large numbers of trained officers loyal to the Soviet power .
Lenin provided an early experiment of Marx 's theory when he invaded Poland in hopes of generating a communist uprising in neighboring Germany .
In 1921 , a Red Army occupation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia overthrew the representative Georgian government and replaced it with a Soviet Republic .
In 1937 , however , Stalin purged the Red Army of its best military leaders .
In 1973 the minister of defense became a full Politburo member for the first time since 1957 .
Yet Brezhnev evidently felt threatened by the professional military , and he sought to create an aura of military leadership around himself in an effort to establish his authority over the armed forces .
This decision was influenced by the formative wars of its history , namely the Russian Civil War and the Polish @-@ Soviet War .
Instead , they featured long range mobile operations , often by small but highly motivated forces , as well as rapid advances of hundreds of kilometers in a matter of days .
The huge tank forces , powerful only on paper , were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa .
Nevertheless , the revolutionary doctrines of the 1930s , modified by combat experience , were eventually successfully used at the front starting in 1943 after the Red Army regained the initiative .
Nazi @-@ Soviet relations were tempered by Hitler 's personal hatred of the people of East Europe and by the longstanding ideological feud between fascism and communism .
As a direct result of the Soviet aggression the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations on December 14 , 1939 .
The Red Army encircled and destroyed significant German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad , which ended in February 1943 and reversed the tide of the war in Europe .
In the summer of 1943 , following the Battle of Kursk , the Red Army seized the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war .
Once Germany had surrendered , the Red Army joined the war against Japan , and in summer 1945 carried out an offensive against Japanese forces stationed in northern Manchuria .
The Red Army emerged from the war as one of the most powerful land armies in history with five million soldiers , and more tanks and artillery than all other countries combined .
During the war , the Red Army was perceived as being far more powerful than any other country .
Many of the Soviet forces who fought to liberate the countries of Eastern Europe from Nazi control remained in the region even after Germany 's surrender in 1945 .
The Soviets quickly became an enormous political and economic influence in the region and the Soviet Union actively assisted local communist parties in coming to power .
By 1948 , seven eastern European countries had communist governments .
Extensive arms sales made weapons like the AK @-@ 47 and the T @-@ 55 tank icons of the contemporary wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors .
After ten years of fighting at the cost of approximately 20 billion dollars a year ( in 1986 United States dollars ) and 15,000 Soviet casualties , Gorbachev surrendered to public opinion and ordered troops to withdraw in early 1989 .
From the late 1940s , the Soviet armed forces focused on adapting to the Cold War in the era of nuclear arms by achieving parity with the United States in strategic nuclear weapons .
Though the Soviet Union had proposed various nuclear disarmament plans after the U.S. development of atomic weapons in the Second World War , the Cold War saw the Soviets in the process of developing and deploying nuclear weapons in full force .
By the late 1960s , the Soviet Union had reached a rough parity with the United States in some categories of strategic weaponry , and at that time offered to negotiate limits on strategic nuclear weapons deployments .
As part of the SALT process , the ABM Treaty was also signed .
A second SALT agreement , SALT II , was signed in June 1979 in Vienna .
At one time , the Soviet Union maintained the world 's largest nuclear arsenal in history .
According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council , the peak of approximately 45,000 warheads was reached in 1986 .
Roughly 20,000 of these were believed to be tactical nuclear weapons , reflecting the Red Army doctrine that favored the use of these weapons if war came in Europe .
These weapons were considered both offensive and defensive in nature .
As a result , the Soviet Union has produced some of the world 's most advanced armaments .
The integration of the party , government , and military in the Soviet Union was most evident in the area of defense @-@ related industrial production .
Gosplan , the state planning committee , had an important role in directing necessary supplies and resources to military industries .
The Defense Council made decisions on the development and production of major weapons systems .
At the time , the military @-@ industrial complex employed at least one of every five adults in the Soviet Union .
In 1985 , the Soviet military had about 5.3 million men ; by 1990 the number declined to about four million .
At the time the Soviet Union dissolved , the residual forces belonging to the Russian Federation were 2.7 million strong .
On April 9 , 1989 , the army , together with MVD units , killed 20 demonstrators in Tbilisi in Georgia .
The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993 .
Most of the nuclear stockpile was inherited by Russia .
In many cases , involvement was in the form of military advisors as well as the sale or provision of weapons .

Paul Klee ( ; 18 December 1879 - 29 June 1940 ) was a Swiss @-@ German painter .
He and his colleague , Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky , both taught at the Bauhaus school of art , design and architecture .
" As a musician , he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the eighteenth and nineteenth century , but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles .
" On his own time , in addition to his deep interests in music and art , Klee was a great reader of literature , and later a writer on art theory and aesthetics .
With his parents ' reluctant permission , in 1898 Klee began studying art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Heinrich Knirr and Franz von Stuck .
He later recalled , " During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint .
After receiving his Fine Arts degree , Klee went to Italy from October 1901 to May 1902 with friend Hermann Haller .
Humanism wants to suffocate me .
" He responded to the colors of Italy , but sadly noted , " that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color .
Returning to Bern , he lived with his parents for several years , and took occasional art classes .

One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is " The Bavarian Don Giovanni " ( 1919 ) .
His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key .
That is why , inwardly , it is none of my concern .
That same year , Klee had his first exhibits in Paris , and he became a hit with the French Surrealists .
In 1929 , the first major monograph on Klee 's work was published , written by Will Grohmann .
The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933 .
His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures .
He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color .
Many of his works combine these skills .
Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921 , " Even if you hadn 't told me he plays the violin , I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music .
During his 60th birthday Klee was photographed in front of this picture .
Paul Éluard and Crevel are also interested in Klee , and they have even visited him .
In 1968 , a jazz group called The National Gallery featuring composer Chuck Mangione released the album " Performing Musical Interpretations of the Paintings of Paul Klee . "
Copernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia , a region that had been a part of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466 .
Nicolaus was the youngest of four children .
The village 's name has been variously spelled Kopernik , Copernik , Copernic , Kopernic , Coprirnik , and today Koperniki .
In the 14th century , members of the family began moving to various other Silesian cities , to the Polish capital , Kraków ( 1367 ) , and to Toruń ( 1400 ) .
Nicolaus ' father was actively engaged in the politics of the day and supported Poland and the cities against the Teutonic Order .
Copernicus ' father married Barbara Watzenrode , the astronomer 's mother , between 1461 and 1464 .
The Watzenrode family , like the Kopernik family , had come from Silesia from near Świdnica ( Schweidnitz ) , and after 1360 had settled in Toruń .
They soon became one of the wealthiest and most influential patrician families .
The Modlibógs ( the Polish name means " Pray God " ) were a prominent Polish family who had been well known in Poland 's history since 1271 .
He died in 1462 .
Lucas Watzenrode the Younger , the astronomer 's maternal uncle and patron , was educated at the University of Kraków ( now Jagiellonian University ) and at the universities of Cologne and Bologna .
He was a friend and key advisor to each ruler , and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between Warmia and Poland proper .
He also spoke Polish , Greek and Italian .
The vast majority of Copernicus ' surviving works are in Latin , which in his lifetime was the language of academia in Europe .
The German philosophy professor Martin Carrier mentions this as a reason to consider Copernicus ' native language to have been German .
As was to be the case with William Shakespeare a century later , numerous spelling variants of the name are documented for the astronomer and his relatives .
The name first appeared as a place name in Silesia in the 13th century , where it was spelled variously in Latin documents .
During his childhood , about 1480 , the name of his father ( and thus of the future astronomer ) was recorded in Thorn as " Niclas Koppernigk . "
= = = Education = = = = = = = In Poland = = = = Upon the father 's death , young Nicolaus ' maternal uncle , Lucas Watzenrode the Younger ( 1447 @-@ 1512 ) , took the boy under his wing and saw to his education and career .
Copernicus biographers assume that Watzenrode first sent young Copernicus to St. John 's School , at Toruń , where he himself had been a master .
In the winter semester of 1491 @-@ 92 Copernicus , as " Nicolaus Nicolai de Thuronia , " matriculated together with his brother Andrew at the University of Kraków ( now Jagiellonian University ) .
= = = = In Italy = = = = It was only on 20 October 1497 that Copernicus , by proxy , formally succeeded to the Warmia canonry which had been granted to him two years earlier .
To this , by a document dated 10 January 1503 at Padua , he would add a sinecure at the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross in Wrocław , Silesia , Bohemia .
He met the famous astronomer Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara and became his disciple and assistant .
There also seems to be evidence that it was during his Padua stay that the idea finally crystallized , of basing a new system of the world on the movement of the Earth .
No doubt it was soon after ( at latest , in fall 1503 ) that he left Italy for good to return to Warmia .
The Prince @-@ Bishopric of Warmia enjoyed substantial autonomy , with its own diet ( parliament ) and monetary unit ( the same as in the other parts of Royal Prussia ) and treasury .
They are arranged to follow one another in a regular rotation of subjects .
Copernicus had translated the Greek verses into Latin prose , and he now published his version as " Theophilacti scolastici Simocati epistolae morales , rurales et amatoriae interpretatione latina , " which he dedicated to his uncle in gratitude for all the benefits he had received from him .
There , in April 1512 , he participated in the election of Fabian of Lossainen as Prince @-@ Bishop of Warmia .
In 1514 he purchased the northwestern tower within the walls of the Frombork stronghold .
Some of Copernicus ' close friends turned Protestant , but Copernicus never showed a tendency in that direction .
Wilhelm Gnapheus , a Dutch refugee settled in Elbląg , wrote a comedy in Latin , " Morosophus " ( The Foolish Sage ) , and staged it at the Latin school that he had established there .
It contained seven basic assumptions ( detailed below ) .
Thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work .
" In 1533 , Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in Rome outlining Copernicus ' theory .
Scholars disagree on whether Copernicus ' concern was limited to possible astronomical and philosophical objections , or whether he was also concerned about religious objections .
In 1542 Rheticus published a treatise on trigonometry by Copernicus ( later included in the second book of " De revolutionibus " ) .
As long as a hypothesis allows reliable computation , it does not have to match what a philosopher might seek as the truth .
Efforts to locate the remains in 1802 , 1909 , 1939 and 2004 had come to nought .
The DNA from the bones found in the grave matched hair samples taken from a book owned by Copernicus which was kept at the library of the University of Uppsala in Sweden .
A black granite tombstone now identifies him as the founder of the heliocentric theory and also a church canon .
The tombstone bears a representation of Copernicus ' model of the solar system - a golden sun encircled by six of the planets .
The prevailing theory in Europe during Copernicus ' lifetime was the one that Ptolemy published in his " Almagest " circa 150 CE ; the Earth was the stationary center of the universe .
There is no one center of all the celestial circles or spheres . < br > 2 .
The center of the earth is not the center of the universe , but only of gravity and of the lunar sphere . < br > 3 .
Erasmus Reinhold could have been his successor , but died prematurely .
" Additional possibilities are Englishman William Gilbert , along with Achilles Gasser , Georg Vogelin , Valentin Otto , and Tiedemann Giese .
" Tycho Brahe 's system ( " that the earth is stationary , the sun revolves about the earth , and the other planets revolve about the sun " ) also directly competed with Copernicus ' .
" After we had named elements after our city and our state , we wanted to make a statement with a name that was known to everyone , " said Hofmann .

There are currently more than 30,000 accelerators in operation around the world .
A small @-@ scale example of this class is the cathode ray tube in an ordinary old television set .
Other examples are the Cockcroft @-@ Walton generator and the Van de Graaff generator .
The achievable kinetic energy for particles in these devices is limited by electrical breakdown .
= = Uses = = Beams of high @-@ energy particles are useful for both fundamental and applied research in the sciences , and also in many technical and industrial fields unrelated to fundamental research .
It has been estimated that there are approximately 26,000 accelerators worldwide .
These accelerators are used for experimental particle physics .
For the most basic inquiries into the dynamics and structure of matter , space , and time , physicists seek the simplest kinds of interactions at the highest possible energies .
An example of this type of machine is LANSCE at Los Alamos .
Thus there is a great demand for electron accelerators of moderate ( GeV ) energy and high intensity .
= = = Low @-@ energy machines and particle therapy = = = Everyday examples of particle accelerators are cathode ray tubes found in television sets and X @-@ ray generators .
A low @-@ energy particle accelerator called an ion implanter is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits .
At lower energies , beams of accelerated nuclei are also used in medicine as particle therapy , for the treatment of cancer .
= = Electrostatic particle accelerators = = Historically , the first accelerators used simple technology of a single static high voltage to accelerate charged particles .
= = = Linear particle accelerators = = = In a linear particle accelerator ( linac ) , particles are accelerated in a straight line with a target of interest at one end .
The longest linac in the world is the Stanford Linear Accelerator , SLAC , which is long .
SLAC is an electron @-@ positron collider .
As they pass through a hole in the plate , the polarity is switched so that the plate now repels them and they are now accelerated by it towards the next plate .
As the particles approach the speed of light the switching rate of the electric fields becomes so high that they operate at radio frequencies , and so microwave cavities are used in higher energy machines instead of simple plates .
Linear accelerators are also widely used in medicine , for radiotherapy and radiosurgery .
Another advantage is that a circular accelerator is smaller than a linear accelerator of comparable power ( i.e.
Certain accelerators ( synchrotrons ) are however built specially for producing synchrotron light ( X @-@ rays ) .
Therefore particle physicists do not generally think in terms of speed , but rather in terms of a particle 's energy or momentum , usually measured in electron volts ( eV ) .
= = = = Cyclotrons = = = = The earliest operational circular accelerators were cyclotrons , invented in 1929 by Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California , Berkeley .
The particles are injected in the centre of the magnet and are extracted at the outer edge at their maximum energy .
If accelerated further , the beam would continue to spiral outward to a larger radius but the particles would no longer gain enough speed to complete the larger circle in step with the accelerating RF .
The advantage of such a cyclotron is the maximum achievable extracted proton current which is currently 2.2 mA .
The energy and current correspond to 1.3 MW beam power which is the highest of any accelerator currently existing .
This approach suffers from low average beam intensity due to the bunching , and again from the need for a huge magnet of large radius and constant field over the larger orbit demanded by high energy .
Higher energy particles travel a shorter distance in each orbit than they would in a classical cyclotron , thus remaining in phase with the accelerating field .
The main disadvantages are the size and cost of the large magnet needed , and the difficulty in achieving the high magnetic field values required at the outer edge of the structure .

Philosophy in the Soviet Union was officially confined to Marxist @-@ Leninist thinking , which theoretically was the basis of objective and ultimate philosophical truth .
From the beginning of Bolshevik regime , the aim of official Soviet philosophy ( which was taught as an obligatory subject for every course ) , was the theoretical justification of Communist ideas .
Lenin hence took position between a historicist Marxism ( Labriola ) and a determinist Marxism , close to what was later called " social Darwinism " ( Kautsky ) .
The mechanists ( A.K.
Timartizev , Timianski , Axelrod , Stepanov ... ) , came mostly from scientific backgrounds , claimed that Marxist philosophy found its basis in a causal explanation of Nature .
Taking support on the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics , they responded that the mechanists ' conception of nature was too restricted and narrow .
The latter maintained that he was an idealist metaphysician , while Deborin , following Plekhanov , saw Spinoza as a materialist and a dialectician .

In 1631 , five years after the death of his wife , Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris .
The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault , a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family .
Étienne , who never remarried , decided that he alone would educate his children , for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability , particularly his son Blaise .
The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science .
Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections .
It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle ( or conic ) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line ( called the Pascal line ) .
In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the " Cour des Aides " for 65,665 livres .
But in 1638 Richelieu , desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years ' War , defaulted on the government 's bonds .
Suddenly Étienne Pascal 's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300 .
It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children 's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned .
Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived , four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden , Germany , exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators .
Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design .
Pascal later ( in the " Pensées " ) used a probabilistic argument , Pascal 's Wager , to justify belief in God and a virtuous life .
The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz ' formulation of the calculus .
After a religious experience in 1654 , Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics .
The work was unpublished until over a century after his death .
Pascal also used " De l 'Esprit géométrique " to develop a theory of definition .
He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent .
Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics , arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes .
Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible .
He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building .
By 1646 , Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli 's experimentation with barometers .
At the time , most scientists contended that , rather than a vacuum , some invisible matter was present .
This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance , whether visible or invisible ; and that this substance was forever in motion .
Therefore , to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal 's time , a vacuum was an impossibility .
How so ?
* Aristotle wrote how everything moved , and must be moved by something .
His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline , for whom Pascal acted as her conservator .
Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port @-@ Royal .
Pascal was deeply affected and very sad , not because of her choice , but because of his chronic poor health ; he too needed her .
" Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household .
Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave , but she was adamant .
In early January , Jacqueline left for Port @-@ Royal .
During visits to his sister at Port @-@ Royal in 1654 , he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God .
God of Abraham , God of Isaac , God of Jacob , not of the philosophers and the scholars ... " and concluded by quoting Psalm 119 : 16 : " I will not forget thy word .
This piece is now known as the " Memorial . "
For the next four years , he regularly travelled between Port @-@ Royal and Paris .
It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion , the " Provincial Letters . "
= = = The " Provincial Letters " = = = Beginning in 1656 , Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry , a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period ( especially the Jesuits , and in particular Antonio Escobar ) .
The 18 @-@ letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV .
Even Pope Alexander , while publicly opposing them , nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal 's arguments .
Aside from their religious influence , the " Provincial Letters " were popular as a literary work .
When commenting on one particular section ( Thought # 72 ) , Sainte @-@ Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language .
= = = Last works and death = = = T. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as " a man of the world among ascetics , and an ascetic among men of the world .
" Pascal 's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer .
" Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port @-@ Royal in 1661 .
Later that year , his sister Jacqueline died , which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism .
Pascal 's last major achievement , returning to his mechanical genius , was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line , moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats .
In 1662 , Pascal 's illness became more violent , and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister 's death .
Originally applied to gambling , today it is extremely important in economics , especially in actuarial science .
Christiaan Huygens , learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat , wrote the first book on the subject .
Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace .
In literature , Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose .
The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of René Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy , empiricism , was also insufficient for determining major truths .
In France , prestigious annual awards , Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region .
Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary , " Sea of Faith , " presented by Don Cupitt .
" By this , Protagoras meant that each individual is the measure of how things are perceived by that individual .
The most famous saying of Protagoras is : " Man is the measure of all things : of things which are , that they are , and of things which are not , that they are not . "

Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly Victorian paternal grandparents , who lived at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park .
His grandfather , former Prime Minister Earl Russell , died in 1878 , and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair .
The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer , emotional repression , and formality ; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion , but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings .
Russell 's adolescence was very lonely , and he often contemplated suicide .
During these formative years he also discovered the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley .

It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921 , after a lengthy period of separation .
In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the London School of Economics , where he also lectured on the science of power in the autumn of 1937 .
He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb .
Russell became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1908 .

Their children were John Conrad Russell , 4th Earl Russell , born on 16 November 1921 , and Katharine Jane Russell ( now Lady Katharine Tait ) , born on 29 December 1923 .
Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics , ethics , and education to the layman .
They separated in 1932 and finally divorced .
On 18 January 1936 , Russell married his third wife , an Oxford undergraduate named Patricia ( " Peter " ) Spence , who had been his children 's governess since 1930 .
During the 1930s , Russell became a close friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon , then secretary of the India League , the foremost lobby for Indian independence in Great Britain .
He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy .
Before World War II , Russell taught at the University of Chicago , later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy .
His relationship with the eccentric Albert C. Barnes soon soured , and he returned to Britain in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College .
In the King 's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949 , Russell was awarded the Order of Merit , and the following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature .
Russell married his fourth wife , Edith Finch , soon after the divorce , on 15 December 1952 .
They had known each other since 1925 , and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia , sharing a house for 20 years with Russell 's old friend Lucy Donnelly .

In 305 BC , Chandragupta defeated Seleucus I Nicator , who ruled the Seleucid Empire and controlled most of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great .
Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia , including southern Afghanistan , to Chandragupta .
Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta .
In this matrimonial alliance the enmity turned into friendship , and Seleucus ' dispatched an ambassador , Megasthenes , to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra .
As a result of this treaty , the Maurya Empire was recognized as a great power by the Hellenistic World , and the kings of Egypt and Syria sent their own ambassadors to his court .

Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks ' office .
Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on " Life in Hell " but instead decided to create a new set of characters .
After appearing on " The Tracey Ullman Show " for three years , the Simpson family received its own series on Fox , which debuted December 17 , 1989 .
At ten years old , Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge , and the brother of Lisa and Maggie .
In casting , Nancy Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa , while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart.
Smith 's voice was too high for a boy , so she was given the role of Lisa .
Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time , so instead auditioned for Bart , which she thought was a better role .
Around the third season , the series started to focus more on the family as a whole , though Bart still remains a prominent character .
In 2000 , Bart , along with the rest of his family , was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

Bart 's first day of school was in the early 1990s .
Now , what do you say ?

' " Smith was given the role of Lisa instead .

For " Lisa 's Wedding , " ( season six , 1995 ) Bart 's voice was electronically lowered .
Despite Bart 's fame , Cartwright is rarely recognized in public .
During the first season of " The Simpsons , " the Fox Network did not allow Cartwright to give interviews because they did not want to publicize that Bart was voiced by a woman .

Due to Bart 's mischievousness and Homer 's often uncaring and incompetent behavior , the two have a turbulent relationship .

Most scholars believe Leibniz developed calculus independently of Isaac Newton , and Leibniz 's notation has been widely used ever since it was published .
Leibniz , along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza , was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism .
Leibniz made major contributions to physics and technology , and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy , probability theory , biology , medicine , geology , psychology , linguistics , and computer science .
He wrote works on philosophy , politics , law , ethics , theology , history , and philology .
He wrote in several languages , but primarily in Latin , French , and German .
There is no complete gathering of the writings of Leibniz .
" His father died when he was six years old , and from that point on he was raised by his mother .
Leibniz 's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Leipzig , and the boy later inherited his father 's personal library .
He was given free access to it from the age of seven .
He enrolled in his father 's former university at age 15 , and completed his Bachelor 's degree in Philosophy in December 1662 .
He published and defended a dissertation " Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum , " arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law , in December 1664 .
After one year of legal studies , he was awarded his Bachelor 's degree in Law on September 28 , 1665 .
In 1666 , at age 20 , Leibniz wrote his first book , " On the Art of Combinations , " the first part of which was also his habilitation thesis in Philosophy .
Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig .
Leibniz then enrolled in the University of Altdorf and quickly submitted a thesis , which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig .
Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666 .
He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf , saying that " my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction . "
Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant , and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him .
Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment .
Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672 , Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674 .
Leibniz 's service to the Elector soon followed a diplomatic role .
He published an essay , under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman , arguing ( unsuccessfully ) for the German candidate for the Polish crown .
Soon after arriving , he met Dutch physicist and mathematician Christiaan Huygens and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy .
He befriended a German mathematician , Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus ; they corresponded for the rest of their lives .
Leibniz declined the invitation , but began corresponding with the Duke in 1671 .
On the journey from London to Hanover , Leibniz stopped in The Hague where he met Leeuwenhoek , the discoverer of microorganisms .
The population of Hanover was only about 10,000 , and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz .
By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand , but did not publish it until 1684 .
Leibniz 's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692 , usually in a journal which he and Otto Mencke founded in 1682 , the " Acta Eruditorum . "
From 1687 to 1690 , Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany , Austria , and Italy , seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project .
In 1711 , while traveling in northern Europe , the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz , who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life .
Finally , his dear friend and defender , the Dowager Electress Sophia , died in 1714 .
Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences , neither organization saw fit to honor his passing .
Leibniz was eulogized by Fontenelle , before the Academie des Sciences in Paris , which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700 .
He had many friends and admirers all over Europe .
He wrote only two book @-@ length philosophical treatises , of which only the " Théodicée " of 1710 was published in his lifetime .
Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his " Discourse on Metaphysics , " which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between Nicolas Malebranche and Antoine Arnauld .
The " Monadologie , " composed in 1714 and published posthumously , consists of 90 aphorisms .
Leibniz met Spinoza in 1676 , read some of his unpublished writings , and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza 's ideas .
= = = The Principles = = = Leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles : * Identity / contradiction .
If a proposition is true , then its negation is false and vice versa .
Monads are centers of force ; substance is force , while space , matter , and motion are merely phenomenal .
In effect , apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world , because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws .
Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism : if God is all good , all wise and all powerful , how did evil come into the world ?
The answer ( according to Leibniz ) is that , while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power , his human creations , as creations , are limited both in their wisdom and in their will ( power to act ) .
But Gerhard and Couturat did not publish these writings until modern formal logic had emerged in Frege 's " Begriffsschrift " and in writings by Charles Sanders Peirce and his students in the 1880s , and hence well after Boole and De Morgan began that logic in 1847 .
But Leibniz took his speculations much further .
Many characters well known in his day , including Egyptian hieroglyphics , Chinese characters , and the symbols of astronomy and chemistry , he deemed not real .
Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of prime factorization suggests a central role for prime numbers in the universal characteristic , a striking anticipation of Gödel numbering .
Granted , there is no intuitive or mnemonic way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers .
The resulting " characteristic " included a logical calculus , some combinatorics , algebra , his " analysis situs " ( geometry of situation ) , a universal concept language , and more .
What Leibniz actually intended by his " characteristica universalis " and calculus ratiocinator , and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to the calculus , may never be established .
The best overview of Leibniz 's writings on the calculus may be found in Bos ( 1974 ) .
= = = Calculus = = = Leibniz is credited , along with Sir Isaac Newton , with the discovery of calculus ( differential and integral calculus ) .
Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684 .
In addition , the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the Leibniz integral rule .
From 1711 until his death , Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill , Newton and others , over whether Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton .
The use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of Karl Weierstrass , but survived in science and engineering , and even in rigorous mathematics , via the fundamental computational device known as the differential .
There are two takes on this situation .
But Hideaki Hirano argues differently , quoting Mandelbrot : To sample Leibniz ' scientific works is a sobering experience .
In " Euclidis Prota ... , " which is an attempt to tighten Euclid 's axioms , he states ... : ' I have diverse definitions for the straight line .
Thus the fractal geometry promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz 's notions of self @-@ similarity and the principle of continuity : " natura non saltum facit . "
This process can be continued infinitely , from which arises a good idea of self @-@ similarity .
" Leibniz 's rule for the derivatives of products is an important , if often overlooked , step in many proofs in diverse fields of physics .
= = = = The " vis viva " = = = = Leibniz 's " vis viva " ( Latin for " living force " ) is " mv " 2 , twice the modern kinetic energy .
He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems , so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter .
In reality , both energy and momentum are conserved , so the two approaches are equally valid .
In embryology , he was a preformationist , but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers .
His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep .
He believed that there are many " petites perceptions , " or small perceptions of which we perceive but are unaware of .
Additionally , the idea of subliminal stimuli can be traced back to this theory .
Leibniz 's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt .
In economic policy , he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program , and discussed the balance of trade .
He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as game theory .
In sociology he laid the ground for communication theory .
= = = Technology = = = In 1906 , Garland published a volume of Leibniz 's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work .
Nevertheless , it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor , engineer , and applied scientist , with great respect for practical life .
He even proposed a method for desalinating water .
From 1680 to 1685 , he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the Harz Mountains , but did not succeed .
Early in life , he documented the binary numeral system ( base 2 ) , then revisited that system throughout his career .
In 1671 , Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetical operations , gradually improving it over a number of years .
A number of such machines were made during his years in Hanover , by a craftsman working under Leibniz 's supervision .
It was not an unambiguous success because it did not fully mechanize the operation of carrying .
Leibniz also devised a ( now reproduced ) cipher machine , recovered by Nicholas Rescher in 2010 .
Leibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace .
The latter library was enormous for its day , as it contained more than 100,000 volumes , and Leibniz helped design a new building for it , believed to be the first building explicitly designed to be a library .
He also designed a book indexing system in ignorance of the only other such system then extant , that of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University .
He called for the creation of an empirical database as a way to further all sciences .
He published the " princeps editio " ( first modern edition ) of the late medieval " Chronicon Holtzatiae , " a Latin chronicle of the County of Holstein .
Having read " Confucius Sinicus Philosophus " on the first year of its publication , he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the Confucian ethical tradition .
He wrote and published an important paper on mechanics .
Leibniz also wrote a short paper , " Primae veritates , " first published by Louis Couturat in 1903 , ( pp .

Publication of Leibniz 's correspondence with notables such as Antoine Arnauld , Samuel Clarke , Sophia of Hanover , and her daughter Sophia Charlotte of Hanover , began .
In 1900 , Bertrand Russell published a critical study of Leibniz 's metaphysics .
Shortly thereafter , Louis Couturat published an important study of Leibniz , and edited a volume of Leibniz 's heretofore unpublished writings , mainly on logic .

Most physicists think that faster @-@ than @-@ light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics .
Nevertheless , negative squared mass fields are commonly referred to as " tachyons , " and in fact have come to play an important role in modern physics .
= = = Mass = = = In a Lorentz invariant theory , the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower @-@ than @-@ light particles ( sometimes called " bradyons " in discussions of tachyons ) must also apply to tachyons .
= = = Speed = = = One curious effect is that , unlike ordinary particles , the speed of a tachyon " increases " as its energy decreases .
In this framework , neutrinos experience Lorentz @-@ violating oscillations and can travel faster than light at high energies .
This proposal was strongly criticized .
( At infinite speed , the two tachyons have no energy each and finite momentum of opposite direction , so no conservation laws are violated in their mutual annihilation .
However , this principle is not widely accepted as resolving the paradoxes .
= = = Fields with imaginary mass = = = In the paper that coined the term " tachyon , " Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass .
However , it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation ( like a particle ) .
= = = Lorentz @-@ violating theories = = = In theories that do not respect Lorentz invariance the speed of light is not ( necessarily ) a barrier , and particles can travel faster than the speed of light without infinite energy or causal paradoxes .
= = = Fields with non @-@ canonical kinetic term = = = By modifying the kinetic energy of the field , it is possible to produce Lorentz invariant field theories with excitations that propagate superluminally .
The first hypothesis regarding faster @-@ than @-@ light particles is sometimes attributed to German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld in 1904 , and more recent discussions happened in 1962 and 1969 .
They have been used as a standby mechanism upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish faster @-@ than @-@ light communication , with or without reference to causality issues .

Xenon is a chemical element with symbol Xe and atomic number 54 .
The isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System .
The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule ( Xe2 ) as its lasing medium , and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps .
In 1902 , Ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth 's atmosphere as one part in 20 million .
During the 1930s , American engineer Harold Edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography .
In 1934 , Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method .
In 1939 , American physician Albert R. Behnke Jr. began exploring the causes of " drunkenness " in deep @-@ sea divers .
Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen , who successfully operated on two patients .
Since then , many other xenon compounds have been discovered , along with some compounds of the noble gases argon , krypton , and radon , including argon fluorohydride ( HArF ) , krypton difluoride ( KrF2 ) , and radon fluoride .
At standard temperature and pressure , pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761 kg / m3 , about 4.5 times the surface density of the Earth 's atmosphere , 1.217 kg / m3 .
As a liquid , xenon has a density of up to 3.100 g / mL , with the density maximum occurring at the triple point .
Under the same conditions , the density of solid xenon , 3.640 g / cm3 , is higher than the average density of granite , 2.75 g / cm3 .
It is inert to most common chemical reactions ( such as combustion , for example ) because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons .
This produces a stable , minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound .
This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American Manhattan Project for plutonium production .
In a similar way , xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe / 130Xe and 136Xe / 130Xe are also a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing .
Deuterated molecules , HXeOD and DXeOH , have also been produced .
Such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure , such as in Lake Vostok underneath the Antarctic ice sheet .
Using this technique , chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed , due to the sensitivity of the chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment .
However , the xenon atom also has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene .
The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1 @-@ 5 ns , and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173 nm .
These arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared , which is used in some night vision systems .
= = = = Lasers = = = = In 1962 , a group of researchers at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon , and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium .
The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer ( Xe2 ) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm .
Unlike nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , xenon is not a greenhouse gas and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly .
Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s .
It was later employed as a propellant for JPL 's Deep Space 1 probe , Europe 's SMART @-@ 1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA 's Dawn Spacecraft .
Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon , particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) .
Xenon is also used in protein crystallography .
As xenon is expensive , the gas sulfur hexafluoride , which is similar to xenon in molecular weight ( 146 versus 131 ) , is generally used in this stunt , and is an asphyxiant without being anesthetic .
Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 .
Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts .
Second , a space @-@ based telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light , which are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere .
Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope .

It was followed by OAO @-@ 2 , which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972 , well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year .
In response to this , a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers .
The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope , and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress .
Congress eventually approved funding of US $ 36 million for 1978 , and the design of the LST began in earnest , aiming for a launch date of 1983 .
= = = Optical Telescope Assembly ( OTA ) = = = Optically , the HST is a Cassegrain reflector of Ritchey @-@ Chrétien design , as are most large professional telescopes .
The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance , and they were designed to exacting specifications .
Therefore its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers , or about 1 / 65 of the wavelength of red light .
( The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work .
An Itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.4 m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory .
Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin @-@ Elmer 's competence on a project of this importance , as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate .
NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986 .
By this time , the total project budget had risen to US $ 1.175 billion .
= = = Spacecraft systems = = = The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge .
To reduce that risk , a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space .
It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000 .
Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS , which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble .
The FOC was constructed by ESA , while the University of California , San Diego , and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS .
The final instrument was the HSP , designed and built at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison .

Being a foreigner and possibly a hetaera , Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes , and thereby was allowed to participate in the public life of the city .
Aspasia would have to have been quite young , if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c . 428 BC .
In social circles , Aspasia was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser rather than merely an object of physical beauty .
Donald Kagan , a Yale historian , believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular in the years immediately following the Samian War .
In 440 BC , Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene , an ancient city of Ionia in the foot @-@ hills of Mycale .
Before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War ( 431 BC @-@ 404 BC ) , Pericles , some of his closest associates and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks .
Aspasia , in particular , was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles ' perversions .
Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles , his friend , Phidias , died in prison .
Anthony J. Podlecki , Professor of Classics at the University of British Columbia , asserts that Plutarch or his source possibly misunderstood a scene in some comedy .
Kagan argues that even if we believe these stories , Aspasia was unharmed with or without the help of Pericles .
According to Podlecki , Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars .
Aspasia was labeled the " New Omphale , " " Deianira , " " Hera " and " Helen . "
Further attacks on Pericles ' relationship with Aspasia are reported by Athenaeus .
= = Later years and death = = In 429 BC during the Plague of Athens , Pericles witnessed the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons , Paralus and Xanthippus , from his first wife .
It is unknown , for example , if she was alive when her son , Pericles , was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae .
= = References in philosophical works = = = = = Ancient philosophical works = = = Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of Plato , Xenophon , Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes .
According to Charles Kahn , Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania , Diotima is in many respects Plato 's response to Aeschines ' Aspasia .
Kahn maintains that Plato has taken from Aeschines the motif of Aspasia as teacher of rhetoric for Pericles and Socrates .
As Martha L. Rose , Professor of History at Truman State University , explains , " only in comedy do dogs litigate , birds govern , or women declaim . "
Xenophon mentions Aspasia twice in his Socratic writings : in " Memorabilia " and in " Oeconomicus . "
In both cases her advice is recommended to Critobulus by Socrates .
In " Oeconomicus " Socrates defers to Aspasia as more knowledgeable about household management and the economic partnership between husband and wife .
Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic dialogue after Aspasia ( though neither survives except in fragments ) .
Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus ' " Aspasia " are Athenaeus , Plutarch , and Cicero .
In the dialogue , Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions .
Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence , connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira .
According to Kahn , every single episode in Aeschines ' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible .
Of Antisthenes ' " Aspasia " only two or three quotations are extant .
Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia , but the entire family of Pericles , including his sons .
= = = Modern literature = = = Aspasia appears in several significant works of modern literature .
In 1835 Lydia Maria Child , an American abolitionist , novelist , and journalist , published " Philothea , " a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia .
This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author 's productions , because the female characters , especially Aspasia , are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy .
In 1836 , Walter Savage Landor , an English writer and poet , published " Pericles and Aspasia , " one of his most famous books .
Robert Hamerling is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia 's personality .
In 1876 he published his novel " Aspasia , " a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest .
These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti .
Leopardi called this person Aspasia , after the companion of Pericles .
Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method .
According to Wallace , the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy .
According to Sr. Prudence Allen , a philosopher and seminary professor , Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho .
For these reasons historian Nicole Loraux questions even the testimony of ancient writers that Aspasia was a hetaera or a courtesan .
On the basis of a comic passage Henry maintains that Aspasia was probably a " pallake , " namely a concubine .
Historian Arnold W. Gomme underscores that " his contemporaries spoke of Pericles as married to Aspasia . "
According to Kahn , stories such as Socrates ' visits to Aspasia , along with his friends ' wives and Lysicles ' connection with Aspasia , are not likely to be historical .
ε . Kagan estimates that , if the trial of Aspasia happened , " we have better reason to believe that it happened in 438 than at any other time . "
According to James F. McGlew , Professor at Iowa State University , it is not very likely that the charge against Aspasia was made by Hermippus .

Stern states that there are more than a dozen known dwarf planets .
However , only two of these bodies , Ceres and Pluto , have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the IAU 's definition .
The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto .
Furthermore , having some unusual characteristics such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination , it became evident it was a completely different kind of body from any of the other planets .
" By 2005 , three trans @-@ Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto ( Quaoar , Sedna , and Eris ) had been reported .

A team is investigating thirty of these , and believe that the number will eventually prove to be about 200 in the Kuiper belt , with thousands more beyond .
The IAU has recognized five bodies as dwarf planets since 2008 : Ceres , Pluto , Eris , Haumea , and Makemake .
Eris is recognized as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto , whereas Haumea and Makemake qualify based on their absolute magnitudes .
In relative distance from the Sun , the five are : # - discovered on January 1 , 1801 , 45 years before Neptune .

Because mesons are composed of sub @-@ particles , they have a physical size , with a diameter roughly one femtometre , which is about the size of a proton or neutron .
Charged mesons decay ( sometimes through intermediate particles ) to form electrons and neutrinos .
In cosmic ray interactions , for example , such particles are ordinary protons and neutrons .
The higher energy ( more massive ) mesons were created momentarily in the Big Bang but are not thought to play a role in nature today .
The other members of the hadron family are the baryons : subatomic particles composed of three quarks rather than two .

In its simplest form , a star network consists of one central switch , hub or computer , which acts as a conduit to transmit messages .
This consists of a central node , to which all other nodes are connected ; this central node provides a common connection point for all nodes through a hub .
In star topology , every node ( computer workstation or any other peripheral ) is connected to a central node called a hub or switch .
An " active " star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo @-@ related problems .
It is also designed with each node ( file servers , workstations , and peripherals ) connected directly to a central network hub , switch , or concentrator .
Data on a star network passes through the hub , switch , or concentrator before continuing to its destination .
The hub , switch , or concentrator manages and controls all functions of the network .
It also acts as a repeater for the data flow .
This configuration is common with twisted pair cable .
However , it can also be used with coaxial cable or optical fibre cable .
At most , 3 devices and 2 links are involved in any communication between any two devices .
Although this topology places a huge overhead on the central hub , with adequate capacity , the hub can handle very high utilization by one device without affecting others .
* Isolation of devices : Each device is inherently isolated by the link that connects it to the hub .
This makes the isolation of individual devices straightforward and amounts to disconnecting each device from the others .
* Benefits from centralization : As the central hub is the bottleneck , increasing its capacity , or connecting additional devices to it , increases the size of the network very easily .
This facilitates analysis of the traffic and detection of suspicious behavior .
* Easy to detect faults and to remove parts .
* Installation and configuration is easy since every one device only requires a link and one input / output port to connect it to any other device ( s ) .

Los Altos ( Spanish for " the highlands " or " the heights " ) was the sixth state of the Federal Republic of Central America , and a short @-@ lived independent republic .
The state originated from the political differences and tensions between Guatemala City on one side , and Quetzaltenango and other parts of western Central America on the other .
Such a separate state was provided for by the Federal constitutional assembly of November 1824 , but there was sizable opposition to the separation in Guatemala City .
The Federal government recognized Los Altos as the sixth state of the union and seated the representatives of Los Altos in the Federal Congress on 5 June of that year .

= = Early life and personality = = Reconstructing the life and doctrine of Arius has proven to be a difficult task , as none of his original writings survive .
Paraphrasing Epiphanius of Salamis , an opponent of Arius , Catholic historian Warren H. Carroll describes him as " tall and lean , of distinguished appearance and polished address .
However , some historians argue that Arius was actually quite conservative , and that he deplored how , in his view , Christian theology was being too freely mixed with Greek pagan philosophy .
This controversy centered upon the nature of the Son of God , and his precise relationship to God the Father .
The express purpose of Alexander 's letter was to complain of the doctrines that Arius was spreading but his charge of heresy against Arius is vague and unsupported by other authorities .
Furthermore , Alexander 's language , like that of most controversialists in those days , is quite bitter and abusive .
The noted Russian historian Alexander Vasiliev refers to Lucian as " the Arius before Arius . "
= = = Origen and Arius = = = Like many third @-@ century Christian scholars , Arius was influenced by the writings of Origen , widely regarded as the first great theologian of Christianity .
The Church was now a powerful force in the Roman world , with Emperors Licinius and Constantine I having legalized it in 313 through the Edict of Milan .
To this end , the emperor sent Hosius , bishop of Córdoba to investigate and , if possible , resolve the controversy .
Arius himself attended the council , as did his bishop , Alexander .
Before the main conclave convened , Hosius initially met with Alexander and his supporters at Nicomedia .
" Thus , Arius insisted that the Father 's Divinity was greater than the Son 's , and that the Son was under God the Father , and not co @-@ equal or co @-@ eternal with Him .
However , Constantine soon found reason to suspect the sincerity of these three , for he later included them in the sentence pronounced on Arius .

= = = The Thalia = = = According to Athanasius , Arius authored a poem called the " Thalia " ( " abundance , " " good cheer " or " banquet " ) : a summary of his views on the " Logos . "
" : " He alone has no equal , no one similar ( ' homoios ' ) , and no one of the same glory .
" : " We worship Him as timeless , in contrast to him who in time has come to exist .
He produced him as a son for Himself , by begetting him .
" : " For being Son , his existence is most certainly at the will of the Father .
" : " What reasoning allows , that he who is from the Father should comprehend and know his own parent ?
" " = = Extant writings = = Three surviving letters attributed to Arius are his letter to Alexander of Alexandria , his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia , and his confession to Constantine .
The two available references from this work are recorded by his opponent Athanasius : the first is a report of Arius 's teaching in " Orations Against the Arians , " 1 : 5 @-@ 6 .

= = Early life = = = = = Family = = = Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus , the future Nero , was born on 15 December 37 in Antium ( modern Anzio and Nettuno ) , near Rome .
He was the only son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger , sister of Emperor Caligula .
Nero 's father was described by Suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor Tiberius with treason , adultery and incest .
Nero 's mother was Agrippina the Younger , a great @-@ granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife Scribonia through their daughter Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa .
Agrippina 's father , Germanicus , was a grandson of Augustus 's wife , Livia , on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other .
Germanicus ' mother Antonia Minor , was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony .
Germanicus was also the adopted son of Tiberius .
Caligula , his wife Caesonia and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered on 24 January 41 .
These events led Claudius , Caligula 's uncle , to become emperor .
Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria Messalina .
His previous marriages produced three children including a son , Drusus , who died at a young age .
He had two children with Messalina - Claudia Octavia ( born 40 ) and Britannicus ( born 41 ) .
Messalina was executed by Claudius in the year 48 .
To aid Claudius politically , young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the name Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus ( see adoption in Rome ) .
Nero was older than his stepbrother Britannicus , and thus became heir to the throne .
Nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 .
In 53 , he married his stepsister Claudia Octavia .
Very early in Nero 's rule , problems arose from competition for influence between Agrippina and Nero 's two main advisers , Seneca and Burrus .
Nero was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with Claudia Acte , a former slave .
In 55 , Agrippina attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss Acte .
Nero , with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs .
According to Tacitus , Agrippina hoped that with her support , Britannicus , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over Nero .
After the death of Britannicus , Agrippina was accused of slandering Octavia and Nero ordered her out of the imperial residence .
In 55 , he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas , an ally of Agrippina , from his position in the treasury .
Pallas , along with Burrus , was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring Faustus Sulla to the throne .
Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas and Burrus acquitted .
In 58 , Nero became romantically involved with Poppaea Sabina , the wife of his friend and future emperor Otho .
Reportedly because a marriage to Poppaea and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with Agrippina alive , Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59 .
Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire from public affairs .
After public protests , Nero was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return .
Accusations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62 .
The Senate ruled that Antistius , a praetor , should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party .
Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso began in this year .
To consolidate power , Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , Rubellius Plautus and Faustus Sulla .
Nero began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy .
In 55 , Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator .
He was consul four times between 55 and 60 .
Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public .
The festival included games , poetry , and theater .
In 64 , Rome burned .
Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction .
He erected the large Domus Aurea .
In 67 , Nero attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of Corinth .

The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus Maximus in shops selling flammable goods .
At first , Nero only performed for a private audience .
In 64 AD . , Nero began singing in public in Neapolis in order to improve his popularity .
It was said that Nero craved the attention , but historians also write that Nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people .
Nero was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance .
He also performed as an actor and a singer .
With his death , the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty ended .
The lower @-@ class , slaves , frequenters of the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero , " on the other hand , were upset with the news .
The civil war during the year of the Four Emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period .
Galba began his short reign with the execution of many allies of Nero and possible future enemies .
Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero .
After Nero 's suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return .
The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus , Suetonius and Cassius Dio , who were all of the senatorial class .
Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death , while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero 's death .
A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero .
; Cassius DioCassius Dio ( c . 155 @-@ 229 ) was the son of Cassius Apronianus , a Roman senator .
He passed the greater part of his life in public service .
He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus ; and afterwards suffect consul around 205 , and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia .
Of other historians , he said : ; LucanThough more of a poet than historian , Lucanus ( c . 39 @-@ 65 ) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero 's rule .
; Pliny the ElderThe history of Nero by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 @-@ 79 ) did not survive .
" ; PlutarchPlutarch ( c . 46 @-@ 127 ) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho .
; Seneca the YoungerIt is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BEC @-@ 65 ) , Nero 's teacher and advisor , writes very well of Nero .
; SuetoniusSuetonius ( c . 69 @-@ 130 ) was a member of the equestrian order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence .

Hooke studied at Wadham College during the Protectorate where he became one of a tightly knit group of ardent Royalists led by John Wilkins .
He built some of the earliest Gregorian telescopes and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter .
Based on his microscopic observations of fossils , Hooke was an early proponent of biological evolution .
= = Life and works = = Much of what is known of Hooke 's early life comes from an autobiography that he commenced in 1696 but never completed .
Richard Waller mentions it in his introduction to " The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke , M.D.
= = = Early life = = = Robert Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles .
Robert was the last of four children , two boys and two girls , and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest .
Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church .
As a youth , Robert Hooke was fascinated by observation , mechanical works , and drawing , interests that he would pursue in various ways throughout his life .
It appears that Hooke was one of a group of students whom Busby educated in parallel to the main work of the school .
Contemporary accounts say he was " not much seen " in the school , and this appears to be true of others in a similar position .
= = = Oxford = = = In 1653 , Hooke ( who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the organ ) secured a chorister 's place at Christ Church , Oxford .
He was employed as a " chemical assistant " to Dr Thomas Willis , for whom Hooke developed a great admiration .
In 1659 Hooke described some elements of a method of heavier @-@ than @-@ air flight to Wilkins , but concluded that human muscles were insufficient to the task .
Wadham was then under the guidance of John Wilkins , who had a profound impact on Hooke and those around him .
Wilkins was also a Royalist , and acutely conscious of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times .
There was a sense of urgency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the Protectorate .
Wilkins ' " philosophical meetings " in his study were clearly important , though few records survive except for the experiments Boyle conducted in 1658 and published in 1660 .
This group went on to form the nucleus of the Royal Society .
" It is known that Hooke had a particularly keen eye , and was an adept mathematician , neither of which applied to Boyle .
Regardless , it is clear that Hooke was a valued assistant to Boyle and the two retained a mutual high regard .
On 5 November 1661 , Sir Robert Moray proposed that a Curator be appointed to furnish the society with Experiments , and this was unanimously passed with Hooke being named .
On 27 June 1664 he was confirmed to the office , and on 11 January 1665 was named " Curator by Office " for life with an additional salary of £ 30 to Cutler 's annuity .
There were also experiments on the subject of gravity , the falling of objects , the weighing of bodies and measuring of barometric pressure at different heights , and pendulums up to .
On 20 March 1664 , Hooke succeeded Arthur Dacres as Gresham Professor of Geometry .
= = = Hooke and Newcomen = = = There is a widely reported story that Dr. Hooke corresponded with Thomas Newcomen in connection with Newcomen 's invention of the steam engine .
A search by Mr. H W Dickinson of Hooke 's papers held by the Royal Society , which had been bound together in the middle of the 18th century , i.e.
Jenkins concluded ... " this story must be omitted from the history of the steam engine , at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming .
" In the intervening years since 1936 no such evidence has been found , but the story persists .
His reputation suffered after his death and this is popularly attributed to a dispute with Isaac Newton over credit for his work on gravitation , the planets and to a lesser degree light .
Hooke 's reputation was revived during the twentieth century through studies of Robert Gunther and Margaret ' Espinasse .
After a long period of relative obscurity he has now been recognised as one of the most important scientists of his age .
This was a time of immense scientific progress , and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously .
His ideas about gravitation , and his claim of priority for the inverse square law , are outlined below .
For example , Arthur Berry said that Hooke " claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time .
The publication of Hooke 's diary in 1935 revealed other sides of the man that ' Espinasse , in particular , has detailed carefully .
" Hooke interacted with noted craftsmen such as Thomas Tompion , the clockmaker , and Christopher Cocks ( Cox ) , an instrument maker .
Hooke often met Christopher Wren , with whom he shared many interests , and had a lasting friendship with John Aubrey .
He took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant , Harry Hunt .
Within his family , Hooke took both a niece and a cousin into his home , teaching them mathematics .
Robert Hooke spent his life largely on the Isle of Wight , at Oxford , and in London .
On 3 March 1703 , Hooke died in London , having amassed a sizable sum of money , which was found in his room at Gresham College .
This was a method sometimes used by scientists , such as Hooke , Huygens , Galileo , and others , to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details .
Hooke became Curator of Experiments in 1662 to the newly founded Royal Society , and took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings .
This was a position he held for over 40 years .
In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics .
On 8 July 1680 , Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates .
Dugald Stewart , in his " Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind , " quoted Hooke 's own words on his system of the world .
" I will explain , " says Hooke , in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666 , " a system of the world very different from any yet received .
Hooke 's statements up to 1674 made no mention , however , that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions .
Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration .
In November 1679 , Hooke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with Newton ( of which the full text is now published ) .
On the other hand , Newton did accept and acknowledge , in all editions of the ' Principia ' , that Hooke ( but not exclusively Hooke ) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system .
Newton acknowledged Wren , Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1 .
= = = = Anchor Escapement = = = = In 1655 , according to his autobiographical notes , Hooke began to acquaint himself with astronomy , through the good offices of John Ward .
" William Derham also attributes it to Hooke .
= = = Microscopy = = = In 1665 Hooke published " Micrographia , " a book describing observations made with microscopes and telescopes , as well as some original work in biology .
" Micrographia " also contains Hooke 's , or perhaps Boyle and Hooke 's , ideas on combustion .
Partington even goes so far as to claim that if " Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion it is probable that he would have discovered oxygen . "
= = = Palaeontology = = = One of the observations in " Micrographia " was of fossil wood , the microscopic structure of which he compared to ordinary wood .
= = = Astronomy = = = One of the more @-@ challenging problems tackled by Hooke was the measurement of the distance to a star ( other than the Sun ) .
The star chosen was Gamma Draconis and the method to be used was parallax determination .
After several months of observing , in 1669 , Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved .
It is now known that Hooke 's equipment was far too imprecise to allow the measurement to succeed .
Gamma Draconis was the same star James Bradley used in 1725 in discovering the aberration of light .
His " Micrographia " contains illustrations of the Pleiades star cluster as well as of lunar craters .
= = = Memory = = = A lesser @-@ known contribution , however one of the first of its kind , was Hooke 's scientific model of human memory .
Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a mechanistic model of human memory , which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it .
This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light .
Hooke 's collaboration with Christopher Wren also included St Paul 's Cathedral , whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke .
Hooke also participated in the design of the Pepys Library , which held the manuscripts of Samuel Pepys ' diaries , the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London .
This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights , as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries .
For an extensive study of Hooke 's architectural work , see the book by Cooper .
In Hooke 's time , the Royal Society met at Gresham College , but within a few months of Hooke 's death Newton became the Society 's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place .
However , when the source was traced by Ashley Montagu , it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke .
In 2003 , historian Lisa Jardine claimed that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke , but this claim was disproved by William Jensen of the University of Cincinnati .
The portrait identified by Jardine depicts the Flemish scholar Jan Baptist van Helmont .
Other possible likenesses of Hooke include the following : * A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man 's head , which some have argued portrays Hooke .
The extent to which the drawing is based on an actual work of art is unknown .
* A memorial window existed at St Helen 's Bishopsgate in London , but it was a formulaic rendering , not a likeness .
In 2003 history painter Rita Greer embarked on a self @-@ funded project to memorialise Hooke .
The Rita Greer Robert Hooke project aimed to produce credible images of him , both painted and drawn , that fitted his contemporary descriptions by John Aubrey and Richard Waller .
Greer 's images of Hooke , his life and work have been used for TV programmes in UK and US , in books , magazines and for PR .

Kelly Rowland , who relocated to Knowles 's house because of family issues , joined them in 1992 .
Originally named Girl 's Tyme , they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor .
With Knowles and Rowland , Girl 's Tyme attracted nationwide attention : west @-@ coast R & B producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them .
He brought them to his studio , The Plant Recording Studios , in Northern California , with focus on Knowles 's vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing .
Because of the group 's defeat , Knowles 's father , Mathew , voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them .
Mathew Knowles cut down the original lineup to four , with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993 .
When summer came , Mathew Knowles established a " boot camp " to train them in dance and vocal lessons .
After rigorous training , they began performing as opening acts for established R & B groups of that time such as SWV , Dru Hill and Immature .
Tina Knowles designed the group 's attire for their performances .
Over the course of the early years in their career , Girl 's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh , Cliché , the Dolls , and to Destiny .
Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records , which signed the group that same year .
" Destiny 's Child " peaked at number sixty @-@ seven on the " Billboard " 200 and number fourteen on the " Billboard " Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums .
It managed to sell over one million copies in the United States , earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

Prior to the video premiere , Knowles announced on " TRL " that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group .
They were replaced by Michelle Williams , a former backup singer to Monica , and Farrah Franklin , an aspiring singer @-@ actress .
Shortly after her stint with Monica , Williams was introduced to Destiny 's Child by choreographer Braden Larson aka " Peanut Orlando , " and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family .
In March 2000 , Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties .
Five months after joining , Franklin left the group .
Although band members were affected by the turmoil , Destiny 's Child 's success continued .
The following years of their career were seen as the group 's most successful stretch , becoming a pop culture phenomenon .
The successful release of the single boosted the sales of the soundtrack album to " Charlie 's Angels " to 1.5 million by 2001 .
It sold 6 million copies as of July 27 , 2001 .
In October 2001 , the group released a holiday album , " 8 Days of Christmas , " which contained updated versions of several Christmas songs .
In February 2001 , Destiny 's Child won two Grammy awards for " Say My Name " : Best R & B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Best R & B Song .
They also earned an American Music Award for Favorite Soul / R & B Band / Duo .

Johannes Kepler ( ; December 27 , 1571 - November 15 , 1630 ) was a German mathematician , astronomer , and astrologer .
These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton 's theory of universal gravitation .
He was also a mathematics teacher in Linz , Austria , and an adviser to General Wallenstein .
His grandfather , Sebald Kepler , had been Lord Mayor of that town but , by the time Johannes was born , he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline .
His father , Heinrich Kepler , earned a precarious living as a mercenary , and he left the family when Johannes was five years old .
In 1589 , after moving through grammar school , Latin school , and seminary at Maulbronn , Kepler attended Tübinger Stift at the University of Tübingen .
Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin , Tübingen 's professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631 , he learned both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system of planetary motion .
After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations ( even with extra planets added to the system ) , Kepler began experimenting with 3 @-@ dimensional polyhedra .
However , Kepler later rejected this formula , because it was not precise enough .
As he indicated in the title , Kepler thought he had revealed God 's geometrical plan for the Universe .
Though the details would be modified in light of his later work , Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral @-@ spherist cosmology of " Mysterium Cosmographicum . "
In terms of the impact of " Mysterium , " it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in his " De Revolutionibus . "

In 1602 , they had a daughter ( Susanna ) ; in 1604 , a son ( Friedrich ) ; and in 1607 , another son ( Ludwig ) .
= = = Other research = = = Following the publication of " Mysterium " and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors , Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work .
Through their letters , Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems , dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory ( particularly its theological viability ) .
But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho 's observatory , Kepler had no way to address many of these issues .
Kepler planned to test his theory from " Mysterium Cosmographicum " based on the Mars data , but he estimated that the work would take up to two years ( since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use ) .
Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements , and in June , Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family .
Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand 's court , it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses , which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz .
These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in " Astronomiae Pars Optica . "
On August 2 , 1600 , after refusing to convert to Catholicism , Kepler and his family were banished from Graz .
Several months later , Kepler returned , now with the rest of his household , to Prague .
In September , Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor : the " Rudolphine Tables " that should replace the " Prutenic Tables " of Erasmus Reinhold .
Two days after Tycho 's unexpected death on October 24 , 1601 , Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work .
The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life .
= = = The Supernova of 1604 = = = In October 1604 , a bright new evening star ( SN 1604 ) appeared , but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself .
It was in this context , as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor , that Kepler described the new star two years later in his " De Stella Nova . "
The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens .
" In the first months of 1610 , Galileo Galilei - using his powerful new telescope - discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter .
Later that year , Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in " Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus , " providing further support of Galileo .
After hearing of Galileo 's telescopic discoveries , Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne .
The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as " Dioptrice " in 1611 .
Kepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids , including the figures that would come to be known as Kepler 's solids .
" Although he gives the date of this epiphany ( March 8 , 1618 ) , he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion .
However , the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s .

= = Life and career = = Stiglitz was born in Gary , Indiana , to Charlotte ( née Fishman ) and Nathaniel D. Stiglitz .
From 1960 to 1963 , he studied at Amherst College , where he was a highly active member of the debate team and president of the student government .
He went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) for his fourth year as an undergraduate , where he later pursued graduate work .
From 1965 to 1966 , he moved to the University of Chicago to do research under Hirofumi Uzawa who had received an NSF grant .
He studied for his PhD from MIT from 1966 to 1967 , during which time he also held an MIT assistant professorship .
He served in the Clinton administration as the chair of the President 's Council of Economic Advisors ( 1995 - 1997 ) .
It was for this contribution to the theory of information asymmetry that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2001 " for laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information " with George A. Akerlof and A. Michael Spence .
For Stiglitz , there is no such thing as an invisible hand .

A legion consisted of several cohorts of heavy infantry known as legionaries .
The fourth class could afford no armour ; perhaps bearing a small shield and armed with spear and javelin .
The equites were later placed in smaller groups of 30 that were commanded by decurions ( which means commander of ten ) .
There were 18 centuries of equites .
In the Republic , legions had an ephemeral existence .
The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet , shield , armour and pilum , a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters .
After 387 BC , the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the gladius , a short sword .
Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC , Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship .
He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally .
This crisis and the civil wars which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the Empire under Augustus in 27 BC .
For example , the defeat of Vitellius in the Year of the Four Emperors was decided when the Danubian legions chose to support Vespasian .
The legion was commanded by a " legatus " or " legate . "
These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000 , including cavalry , of the old Legions .
The earliest " legiones palatinae " were the " Lanciarii , " " Joviani , " " Herculiani " and " Divitenses . "
* Tribunus laticlavius , Broad Band Tribune : Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank , this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate .

* Primus pilus , literally First File : The " Primus Pilus " was the commanding centurion of the first century , first cohort and the senior @-@ most centurion of the entire legion .
When the primus pilus retired , he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class .
He was paid 60 times the base wage .
The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior , and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion .
This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus .
The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6 , with only five centuries in the first cohort ( for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus ) .
Paid ten times the basic wage . "
In these cases , the detached subunits carried only the vexillum , and not the aquila , and were called , therefore , " vexillationes . "

The radian is the standard unit of angular measure , used in many areas of mathematics .
An angle 's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle , one radian is just under 57.3 degrees ( when the arc length is equal to the radius ) .
The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit , but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit .
The radian is represented by the symbol rad ( Unicode @-@ encoded as ) .
An alternative symbol is the superscript letter c , for " circular measure " - but this is infrequently used as it can be easily mistaken for a degree symbol ( ° ) .
So for example , a value of 1.2 radians could be written as 1.2 rad , 1.2 , or 1.2 .
As the ratio of two lengths , the radian is a " pure number " that needs no unit symbol , and in mathematical writing the symbol " rad " is almost always omitted .
The idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was already in use by other mathematicians .
For example al @-@ Kashi ( c . 1400 ) used so @-@ called " diameter parts " as units where one diameter part was radian and they also used sexagesimal subunits of the diameter part .
In 1874 , after a consultation with James Thomson , Muir adopted " radian . "
Thus , to convert from radians to degrees , multiply by 180 / π .
In all such cases it is found that the arguments to the functions are most naturally written in the form that corresponds , in geometrical contexts , to the radian measurement of angles .
Although polar and spherical coordinates use radians to describe coordinates in two and three dimensions , the unit is derived from the radius coordinate , so the angle measure is still dimensionless .
= = Use in physics = = The radian is widely used in physics when angular measurements are required .
For example , angular velocity is typically measured in radians per second ( rad / s ) .
Similarly , angular acceleration is often measured in radians per second per second ( rad / s2 ) .
For the purpose of dimensional analysis , the units are s − 1 and s − 2 respectively .
Likewise , the phase difference of two waves can also be measured in radians .
A milliradian ( mrad ) is a thousandth of a radian and a microradian ( urad or μrad ) is a millionth of a radian , i.e.
There are 2π × 1000 milliradians ( ≈ 6283.185 mrad ) in a circle .
An approximation of the trigonometric milliradian ( 0.001 rad ) , known as the ( angular ) mil , is used by NATO and other military organizations in gunnery and targeting .
For the small angles typically found in targeting work , the convenience of using the number 6400 in calculation outweighs the small mathematical errors it introduces .
Being based on the milliradian , the NATO mil subtends roughly 1 m at a range of 1000 m ( at such small angles , the curvature is negligible ) .
Smaller units like microradians ( μrad ) and nanoradians ( nrad ) are used in astronomy , and can also be used to measure the beam quality of lasers with ultra @-@ low divergence .

= = Early life = = Louis Agassiz was born in Môtier ( now part of Haut @-@ Vully ) in the canton of Fribourg , Switzerland .
In 1829 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Erlangen , and in 1830 that of doctor of medicine at Munich .
Spix , who died in 1826 , did not live long enough to work out the history of these fish , and Agassiz ( though fresh out of school ) was selected by Martius for this purpose .
The fossil fish there soon attracted his attention .
Agassiz , as early as 1829 , planned the publication of the work which , more than any other , laid the foundation of his worldwide fame .
Five volumes of his " Recherches sur les poissons fossiles " ( " Research on Fossil Fish " ) appeared at intervals from 1833 to 1843 .
In gathering materials for this work Agassiz visited the principal museums in Europe , and meeting Cuvier in Paris , he received much encouragement and assistance from him .
While Agassiz did much to place the subject on a scientific basis , this classification has been superseded by later work .
The British Association came to his aid , and the Earl of Ellesmere - then Lord Francis Egerton - gave him yet more efficient help .
The 1,290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl , and presented by him to the Geological Society of London .
The strange forms of the " Pterichthys , " the " Coccosteus " and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time .
These labours resulted , in 1840 , in the publication of his work in two volumes entitled " Etudes sur les glaciers " ( " Studies on Glaciers " ) .
Thus familiarized with the phenomena associated with the movements of recent glaciers , Agassiz was prepared for a discovery which he made in 1840 , in conjunction with William Buckland .
In 1852 he accepted a medical professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown , Massachusetts , but he resigned in two years .
During this time he also published a catalog of papers in his field , " Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae , " in four volumes between 1848 and 1854 .
In 1863 , Agassiz 's daughter Ida married Henry Lee Higginson , later to be founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and benefactor to Harvard University and other schools .
He died in Cambridge , Massachusetts in 1873 and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery , joined later by his wife .
The school 's name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21 , 2002 , due to concerns about Agassiz 's racism , and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin the African @-@ American principal of the school who served from 1889 until 1922 .

Khosrau I was a great builder , embellishing his capital , founding new towns , and constructing new buildings .
Most of these positions were patrimonial , and many were passed down through a single family for generations .
Culturally , the Sassanids implemented a system of social stratification .
This system was supported by Zoroastrianism , which was established as the state religion .
The Sassanids , similar to the Roman Empire , were in a constant state of conflict with neighboring kingdoms and nomadic hordes .
The construction of fortifications such as Tus citadel or the city of Nishapur , which later became a center of learning and trade , also assisted in defending the eastern provinces from attack .
The Sassanids built numerous fortifications in the Caucasus region to halt these attacks .
Commercially , land and sea trade with China was important to both the Sassanid and Chinese Empires .
Politically , there is evidence of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy , the Hephthalites .

The art of this period reveals an astonishing virility , in certain respects anticipating key features of Islamic art .
The conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great had inaugurated the spread of Hellenistic art into Western Asia .
Already in the Parthian period , Hellenistic art was being interpreted freely by the peoples of the Near East .
Throughout the Sasanian period , there was reaction against it .
In addition to local traditions , Parthian architecture influenced Sasanian architectural characteristics .
Many of the palaces contain an inner audience hall consisting , as at Firuzabad , of a chamber surmounted by a dome .
Buildings were decorated with wall paintings .
Guilds were numerous .
Khosrau I further extended the already vast trade network .
The main exports of the Sasanians were silk ; woolen and golden textiles ; carpets and rugs ; hides ; and , leather and pearls from the Persian Gulf .
The extraordinary mineral wealth of the Pamir Mountains on the eastern horizon of the Sasanian empire led to a legend among the Tajiks , an Iranian people living there , which is still told today .
Shapur I ( Shabur Malka in Aramaic ) was a particular friend to the Jews .
Today there are over 70,000 Zoroastrians in India .

Like other typical Gram @-@ negative bacteria , the outer membrane of " H. pylori " consists of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
The Italian researcher Giulio Bizzozero described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893 .
Several small studies conducted in the early 20th century demonstrated the presence of curved rods in the stomach of many patients with peptic ulcers and stomach cancer .
Interest in the bacteria waned , however , when an American study published in 1954 failed to observe the bacteria in 1180 stomach biopsies .
Interest in understanding the role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in the 1970s , with the visualization of bacteria in the stomachs of gastric ulcer patients .
The bacteria had also been observed in 1979 , by Robin Warren , who researched it further with Barry Marshall from 1981 .
He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later .
An endoscopy 10 days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of " H. pylori . "
Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis .

The larger the film gauge , the higher the overall image resolution clarity and technical quality .
Most photographic filters are made up of two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass .
In the case of color filters , there is often a translucent color medium pressed between two planes of optical glass .
Certain cinematographers , such as Christopher Doyle , are well known for their innovative use of filters .
Filters can be used in front of the lens or , in some cases , behind the lens for different effects .
Certain scenes or even types of filmmaking , however , may require the use of zooms for speed or ease of use , as well as shots involving a zoom move .
Depth of field is also governed by the format size .
Nonetheless , they are a useful starting point for classification .

* The overall scene is within a room where , at an open end on the left , a wide @-@ eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms .
Art historian Patricia Failing said , " The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture .
Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso 's career .
The Pavilion 's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan : : We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain .
: We are fighting for the independence of our country and for : the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny .
At Picasso 's request the safekeeping of the piece was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York City .
The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions , but until 1981 , " Guernica " itself remained at MoMA .
After Franco 's death , Spain was transformed into a democratic constitutional monarchy , ratified by a new constitution in 1978 .
During the 1970s , it was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime and of Basque nationalism .
However , since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting .
Basque nationalists have advocated that the picture should be brought to the Basque country , especially after the building of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum .
Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible , although the Basque government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bilbao .

The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured , and was determined to have the same diffraction pattern as those predicted by Bragg for x @-@ rays .
Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis , diffraction was a property that was thought to be only exhibited by waves .
When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the Bragg condition , the observed diffraction pattern was predicted , thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons .

In physics , a force is said to do work if , when acting on a body , there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force .
The SI unit of work is the newton @-@ metre or joule ( J ) .
= = Units = = The SI unit of work is the joule ( J ) , which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a distance of one metre .
The dimensionally equivalent newton @-@ metre ( N · m ) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work , but this can be confused with the unit newton @-@ metre , which is the measurement unit of torque .
Due to work having the same physical dimension as heat , occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content , such as therm , BTU and Calorie , are utilized as a measuring unit .
The work / energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work / energy principles .
This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball .
Another example is a book on a table .
If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table , then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards .
It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed .
Thus , at any instant , the rate of the work done by a force ( measured in joules / second , or watts ) is the scalar product of the force ( a vector ) , and the velocity vector of the point of application .
Work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a distance .
As the point moves , it follows a curve X , with a velocity v , at each instant .
The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work , : formula _ 7where " C " is the trajectory from x ( t1 ) to x ( t2 ) .
If the force is always directed along this line , and the magnitude of the force is " F , " then this integral simplifies to : formula _ 8where " s " is distance along the line .
If F is constant , in addition to being directed along the line , then the integral simplifies further to : formula _ 9where " s " is the distance travelled by the point along the line .
This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line , followed by the particle .
Thus , no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit ( this is ideal , as all orbits are slightly elliptical ) .
This integral depends on the rotational trajectory " φ ( t ) , " and is therefore path @-@ dependent .
= = Work and potential energy = = The scalar product of a force F and the velocity v of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time .
Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application , " C " = x ( t ) , defines the work input to the system by the force .
Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces .
Near the surface of the earth the acceleration due to gravity is g = 9.8 m.s − 2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is Fg = " mg . "
It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object .
Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object .
The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy .
This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power .
This section focuses on the work @-@ energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics .
In more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device , the heat energy in a thermal system , or the electrical energy in an electrical device .
Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another .
The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement .
To see this , consider a particle P that follows the trajectory X ( t ) with a force F acting on it .
This can also be written as : formula _ 54This integral is computed along the trajectory X ( t ) of the particle and is therefore path dependent .
Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be X ( t ) which is a curve in three @-@ dimensional space .
Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle .
To see this , let the forces F1 , F2 ... Fn act on the points X1 , X2 ... Xn in a rigid body .

Anna Maria Quaini or Mina Mazzini , OMRI ( 25 March 1940 ) , known as Mina , is one of the most successful Italian singers of all time .
In performance , Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and swing music , which made her the most versatile pop singer in Italian music .
Mina was banned from Italian TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois morals .
Shirley Bassey carried Mina 's ballad " Grande grande grande " to charts in the U.S. , U.K. , and other English @-@ speaking countries in 1973 .

She listened to American rock and roll and jazz records and was a frequent visitor at the Santa Tecla and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan , both known for promoting rock and roll .
In September , she started her solo career with the backing of the band Happy Boys .
She soon signed with Davide Matalon , owner of the small record company Italdisc .
Her first single , " Non partir " / " Malatia , " was produced under the stage name Mina for the Italian audience .
In December , her performance at the Sei giorni della canzone festival of Milan was described by the " La Notte " newspaper as the " birth of a star . "
It was Mina 's last performance with the Happy Boys , as her family refused to let her skip college for a scheduled tour of Turkey .
In late 1959 , Matalon had her drop the name Baby Gate in favour of Mina .

If the two states are equal in energy , each different configuration is equally likely .
If we can tell which particle is which , there are formula _ 4 different configurations , since each particle can be in formula _ 2 or formula _ 3 independently .
In almost all of the configurations , about half the particles are in formula _ 2 and the other half in formula _ 3 .
The balance is a statistical effect : the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally .
If there are " K " particles in state formula _ 3 , there are particles in state formula _ 2 .
In the distinguishable case , for large " N , " the fraction in state formula _ 2 can be computed .
It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to " p " = exp ( − " E " / " T " ) to land tails .
The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state , in the limit that formula _ 21 , is equal to formula _ 22 .
This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles .
If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states , for high temperatures and low densities , the particles will all be in different states .
In this limit , the gas is classical .
From this point on , any extra particle added will go into the ground state .

A group led by Randall Hulet at Rice University announced a condensate of lithium atoms only one month following the JILA work .
The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity , with red being the fewest and white being the most .
The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities .
This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction .
This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook " Thermal Physics " by Ralph Baierlein .
The notion is easily generalized .
Further work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the JILA team , of Cornell , Wieman and coworkers .
Nevertheless , they have proven useful in exploring a wide range of questions in fundamental physics , and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an explosion in experimental and theoretical activity .
These have been used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a Mott insulator , and may be useful in studying Bose @-@ Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions , for example the Tonks @-@ Girardeau gas .

Hans Dieter Seibel , board member of the European Microfinance Platform , is in favour of the group model .
This particular model ( used by many Microfinance institutions ) makes financial sense , he says , because it reduces transaction costs .
Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds .
Independently of Spooner , Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural Germany .
The modern use of the expression " microfinancing " has roots in the 1970s when organizations , such as Grameen Bank of Bangladesh with the microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus , were starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing .

It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities .
Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them , as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions .
In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions , since different institutions serve different needs .
# Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country 's mainstream financial system .
# " The job of government is to enable financial services , not to provide them .
" # " The key bottleneck is the shortage of strong institutions and managers .
Families who are destitute , or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan , should be recipients of charity .

The result was the POWER instruction set architecture , introduced with the RISC System / 6000 in early 1990 .
Windows , OS / 2 and Sun customers , faced with the lack of application software for the PowerPC , almost universally ignored the chip .
The PowerPC versions of Solaris , OS / 2 , and Windows were discontinued after only a brief period on the market .
To Apple , the performance of the PowerPC was a bright spot in the face of increased competition from Windows 95 and Windows NT @-@ based PCs .
In 2004 , Motorola exited the chip manufacturing business by spinning off its semiconductor business as an independent company called Freescale Semiconductor .

Apple continued work on a new line of Macintosh computers based on the chip , and eventually released them as the 601 @-@ based " Power Macintosh " on March 14 , 1994 .
Accordingly , and further because IBM had developed animosity toward Microsoft , IBM decided to rewrite OS / 2 for the PowerPC .
Apple , which also lacked a PowerPC based OS , took a different route .
They rewrote the essential pieces of their Mac OS operating system for the PowerPC architecture , and further wrote a 680x0 emulator that could run 68k based applications and the parts of the OS that had not been rewritten .
The 603 is notable due to its very low cost and power consumption .
This was a deliberate design goal on Motorola 's part , who used the 603 project to build the basic core for all future generations of PPC chips .
The 603e solved this problem by having a 16 KiB L1 cache which allowed the emulator to run efficiently .
The 970 is a 64 @-@ bit processor derived from the POWER4 server processor .

The waste heat from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam , in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency .
Commercial electric utility power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation .
Shipboard steam power plants can be either fossil fuel or nuclear .
When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at Pearl Street Station in New York and Holborn Viaduct power station in London , reciprocating steam engines were used .
Above the critical point for water of and 3212 psi ( 22.06 MPa ) , there is no phase transition from water to steam , but only a gradual decrease in density .
In a nuclear reactor called a boiling water reactor ( BWR ) , water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators .
Its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about in diameter .
It is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace .
Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal .
Plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as heat recovery steam generators ( HRSG ) .
From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re @-@ enters the steam drum .
In the steam drum , the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam .
The surface condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes .
For best efficiency , the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam .
The condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a cooling tower to reject waste heat to the atmosphere , or once @-@ through water from a river , lake or ocean .
There is a high pressure turbine at one end , followed by an intermediate pressure turbine , two low pressure turbines , and the generator .
The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and long .
Superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through diameter piping to the high pressure turbine where it falls in pressure to and to in temperature through the stage .
In operation it generates up to 21,000 amperes at 24,000 volts AC ( 504 MWe ) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 rpm , synchronized to the power grid .
The power grid frequency is 60 Hz across North America and 50 Hz in Europe , Oceania , Asia ( Korea and parts of Japan are notable exceptions ) and parts of Africa .
Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years .
A typical flue gas stack may be tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere .
The tallest flue gas stack in the world is tall at the GRES @-@ 2 power plant in Ekibastuz , Kazakhstan .
In the United States and a number of other countries , atmospheric dispersion modeling studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local air pollution regulations .

A control flow graph ( CFG ) in computer science is a representation , using graph notation , of all paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution .
The CFG is essential to many compiler optimizations and static analysis tools .
If the exit block is unreachable from the entry block , an infinite loop exists .
This tree is rooted at the exit block .
It is advantageous to several optimization passes to break M up into two blocks Mpre and Mloop .
In the beginning , Mpre would be empty , but passes like loop @-@ invariant code motion could populate it .

The term ' inductance ' was coined by Oliver Heaviside in February 1886 .
This is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell 's equations in the fields and the current density .
The integral of the energy transfer is the magnetic field energy as a function of the currents , : formula _ 7This equation also is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell 's equations .
The rate of change of velocity ( current ) multiplied with mass ( inductance ) requires or generates a force ( an electrical voltage ) .
It is important as the mechanism by which transformers work , but it can also cause unwanted coupling between conductors in a circuit .
When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance , the bandwidth will be narrow .
As the amount of mutual inductance increases , the bandwidth continues to grow .
This is known as overcoupling .
See a derivation of this equation .
These materials over a large enough range exhibit a nonlinear permeability with such effects as saturation .

Many hardware systems use DMA , including disk drive controllers , graphics cards , network cards and sound cards .
Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels .
Each DMA channel has a 16 @-@ bit address register and a 16 @-@ bit count register associated with it .
Scatter @-@ gather or vectored I / O DMA allows the transfer of data to and from multiple memory areas in a single DMA transaction .
It is equivalent to the chaining together of multiple simple DMA requests .
The motivation is to off @-@ load multiple input / output interrupt and data copy tasks from the CPU .
The system was far more advanced than the AT bus , and computer manufacturers responded with the Extended Industry Standard Architecture ( EISA ) and later , the VESA Local Bus ( VLB ) .
In fact , VLB used some electronic parts originally intended for MCA because component manufacturers already were equipped to manufacture them .
Users of ISA @-@ based machines had to know special information about the hardware they were adding to the system .
Users frequently had to configure several parameters when adding a new device , such as the IRQ line , I / O address , or DMA channel .
MCA had done away with this complication , and PCI actually incorporated many of the ideas first explored with MCA ( though it was more directly descended from EISA ) .
In reality , ISA PnP can be troublesome , and did not become well @-@ supported until the architecture was in its final days .
Only one of the two connectors can be used in each slot at a time , but this allowed for greater flexibility .
The PC / 104 bus , used in industrial and embedded applications , is a derivative of the ISA bus , utilizing the same signal lines with different connectors .

= = = 8 @-@ bit designs = = = The Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the Intel 8008 , the world 's first 8 @-@ bit microprocessor .
The 8008 was the precursor to the very successful Intel 8080 ( 1974 ) , which offered much improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips , Zilog Z80 ( 1976 ) , and derivative Intel 8 @-@ bit processors .
The Western Design Center , Inc ( WDC ) introduced the CMOS 65C02 in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms .
It was used as the CPU in the Apple IIe and IIc personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade pacemakers and defibrillators , automotive , industrial and consumer devices .
= = = 16 @-@ bit designs = = = The first multi @-@ chip 16 @-@ bit microprocessor was the National Semiconductor IMP @-@ 16 , introduced in early 1973 .
An 8 @-@ bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP @-@ 8 .
The 9900 was used in the TI 990 / 4 minicomputer , the TI @-@ 99 / 4A home computer , and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards .
A third chip , the TMS 9995 , was a new design .
The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110 .
The Western Design Center ( WDC ) introduced the CMOS 65816 16 @-@ bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS 65C02 in 1984 .
The 65816 16 @-@ bit microprocessor was the core of the Apple IIgs and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , making it one of the most popular 16 @-@ bit designs of all time .
Intel " upsized " their 8080 design into the 16 @-@ bit Intel 8086 , the first member of the x86 family , which powers most modern PC type computers .
The 8088 , a version of the 8086 that used an 8 @-@ bit external data bus , was the microprocessor in the first IBM PC .
Intel then released the 80186 and 80188 , the 80286 and , in 1985 , the 32 @-@ bit 80386 , cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family 's backwards compatibility .
The most significant of the 32 @-@ bit designs is the Motorola MC68000 , introduced in 1979 .
Motorola generally described it as a 16 @-@ bit processor , though it clearly has 32 @-@ bit capable architecture .
The combination of high performance , large ( 16 megabytes or 224 bytes ) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class .
After the divestiture of AT & T in 1984 , it was renamed the WE 32000 ( WE for Western Electric ) , and had two follow @-@ on generations , the WE 32100 and WE 32200 .
All these systems ran the UNIX System V operating system .
Motorola 's success with the 68000 led to the MC68010 , which added virtual memory support .
The MC68020 , introduced in 1984 added full 32 @-@ bit data and address buses .
The 68020 became hugely popular in the Unix supermicrocomputer market , and many small companies ( e.g. , Altos , Charles River Data Systems , Cromemco ) produced desktop @-@ size systems .
The continued success led to the MC68040 , which included an FPU for better math performance .
The 68k family faded from the desktop in the early 1990s .
Other large companies designed the 68020 and follow @-@ ons into embedded equipment .
The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the venerable 68020 .
The MIPS R2000 ( 1984 ) and R3000 ( 1989 ) were highly successful 32 @-@ bit RISC microprocessors .
From 1993 to 2003 , the 32 @-@ bit x86 architectures became increasingly dominant in desktop , laptop , and server markets , and these microprocessors became faster and more capable .
During this span , these processors increased in complexity ( transistor count ) and capability ( instructions / second ) by at least three orders of magnitude .
The move to 64 bits by PowerPC processors had been intended since the processors ' design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility .
Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways , but , as was the case with IA @-@ 32 , both floating point and vector units had been operating at or above 64 bits for several years .
The first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984 by MIPS Computer Systems , the 32 @-@ bit R2000 ( the R1000 was not released ) .
The R3000 made the design truly practical , and the R4000 introduced the world 's first commercially available 64 @-@ bit RISC microprocessor .
Competing projects would result in the IBM POWER and Sun SPARC architectures .
Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design , including the AT & T CRISP , AMD 29000 , Intel i860 and Intel i960 , Motorola 88000 , DEC Alpha .

During weekdays , special code would find errors and flash lights so the operators could correct the problem .
If the number of bits changed is even , the check bit will be valid and the error will not be detected .
If the channel is clean enough , most of the time only one bit will change in each triple .
A code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an " error @-@ correcting " code .
= = Hamming codes = = If more error @-@ correcting bits are included with a message , and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results , then bad bits could be identified .
Unlike high @-@ level languages , there is usually a one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between simple assembly statements and machine language instructions .
In these cases , the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation .
Most instructions refer to a single value , or a pair of values .
Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions , based on the macro arguments .
This could be used to generate record @-@ style data structures or " unrolled " loops , for example , or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters .
This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of GOTO operations in assembly code , one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language .
There has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large @-@ scale assembly language development .
Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well , including a large amount of the IBM mainframe software written by large corporations .
Most early microcomputers relied on hand @-@ coded assembly language , including most operating systems and large applications .
This was because these systems had severe resource constraints , imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures , and provided limited , buggy system services .
Even into the 1990s , most console video games were written in assembly , including most games for the Mega Drive / Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System .
The arcade game NBA Jam ( 1993 ) is another example .
Assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important ; see below .
Assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs .
Programs using such facilities , such as the Linux kernel , can then construct abstractions using different assembly language on each hardware platform .
The system 's portable code can then use these processor @-@ specific components through a uniform interface .
A generation of IBM mainframe programmers called it ALC for " Assembly Language Code " or BAL for Basic Assembly Language .
Calling the language assembler might be considered potentially confusing and ambiguous , since this is also the name of the utility program that translates assembly language statements into machine code .
However , this usage has been common among professionals and in the literature for decades .
* The computational step where an assembler is run , including all macro processing , is termed assembly time .
On Unix systems , the assembler is traditionally called as , although it is not a single body of code , being typically written anew for each port .
A number of Unix variants use GAS .
Within processor groups , each assembler has its own dialect .
Sometimes , some assemblers can read another assembler 's dialect , for example , TASM can read old MASM code , but not the reverse .
The basics are all the same , but the advanced features will differ .
Also , assembly can sometimes be portable across different operating systems on the same type of CPU .

The Pallas 's cat ( " Otocolobus manul " ) , also called manul , is a small wild cat with a broad but fragmented distribution in the grasslands and montane steppes of Central Asia .
The Pallas 's cat was named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas , who first described the cat in 1776 under the binomial " Felis manul . "
Concentric white and black rims around the eyes accentuate their rounded shape .
In 1997 , they were reported for the first time as being present in the eastern Sayan Mountains .
Pallas 's cats give birth to a litter of around two to six kittens after a gestation period of 66 to 75 days , typically in April or May .
They are able to begin hunting at four months , and reach adult size at six months .
The fat and organs of the cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia .
In 1858 , the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov proposed the name " Otocolobus " for the species .
" Otocolobus manul " is estimated to have diverged from a leopard cat ancestor about 5.19 million years ago .

Limiting the number of memory accesses provided the key to extracting high performance from a modern computer .
Now a system can starve several processors at the same time , notably because only one processor can access the computer 's memory at a time .
Of course , not all data ends up confined to a single task , which means that more than one processor may require the same data .
To handle these cases , NUMA systems include additional hardware or software to move data between memory banks .
The IBM System / 360 ( S / 360 ) was a mainframe computer system family announced by IBM on April 7 , 1964 , and delivered between 1965 and 1978 .
Many consider the design one of the most successful computers in history , influencing computer design for years to come .
With other vendors ( with the notable exception of ICT ) , customers had to choose between machines they could outgrow and machines that were potentially overpowered ( and thus too expensive ) .
This meant that many companies simply did not buy computers .
The initial announcement in 1964 included Models 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 62 , and 70 .
The last three , intended to replace the 7000 series machines , never shipped and were replaced by the 65 and 75 , which were first delivered in November 1965 , and January 1966 , respectively .
Later additions to the low @-@ end included models 20 ( 1966 , mentioned above ) , 22 ( 1971 ) , and 25 ( 1968 ) .
A succession of high @-@ end machines included the Model 67 ( 1966 , mentioned below , briefly anticipated as the 64 and 66 ) , 85 ( 1969 ) , 91 ( 1967 , anticipated as the 92 ) , 95 ( 1968 ) , and 195 ( 1971 ) .
The 85 design was intermediate between the System / 360 line and the follow @-@ on System / 370 and was the basis for the 370 / 165 .
IBM stopped marketing all System / 360 models by the end of 1977 .
) Later compatible IBM systems include the 3090 , the ES / 9000 family , 9672 ( System / 390 family ) , the zSeries , System z9 , System z10 and IBM zEnterprise System .
The IBM 5100 portable computer , introduced in 1975 , offered an option to execute the System / 360 's APL.SV programming language through a hardware emulator .
In the complete 32 @-@ bit AP @-@ 101 version , 4 Pi machines were used as the replicated computing nodes of the fault @-@ tolerant Space Shuttle computer system ( in five nodes ) .
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration operated the IBM 9020 , a special cluster of modified System / 360s for air traffic control , from 1970 until the 1990s .
Memory addressing was accomplished using a base @-@ plus @-@ displacement scheme , with registers 1 through F ( 15 ) .
A displacement was encoded in 12 bits , thus allowing a 4096 @-@ byte displacement ( 0 @-@ 4095 ) , as the offset from the address put in a base register .
Every System / 360 ( except for the Model 20 , which was not a standard 360 ) had a byte @-@ multiplexer channel and 1 or more selector channels .
MVT took a long time to develop into a usable system , and the less ambitious MFT was widely used .
Many customers ran quite happily with 4 KB and CPS ( Card Processing System ) .
Stacked job processing became an exciting possibility for the small but adventurous computer user .
In addition , System / 360 computers could use certain peripherals that were originally developed for earlier computers .

Instructions per second ( IPS ) is a measure of a computer 's processor speed .
In the late 1970s , minicomputer performance was compared using " VAX MIPS , " where computers were measured on a task and their performance rated against the VAX 11 / 780 that was marketed as a " 1 MIPS " machine .
( The measure was also known as the " VAX Unit of Performance " or VUP .
" zMIPS " refers to the MIPS measure used internally by IBM to rate its mainframe servers ( zSeries , IBM System z9 , and IBM System z10 ) .
Very low @-@ cost systems , such as some early home computers , would instead use the CPU to send the data through an output pin , using the bit @-@ banging technique .
= = = Hardware abstraction = = = Operating systems usually use a symbolic name to refer to the serial ports of a computer .
The Microsoft MS @-@ DOS and Windows environments refer to serial ports as COM ports : COM1 , COM2 .. etc .
This list includes some of the more common devices that are connected to the serial port on a PC .
= = = Speed = = = Serial ports use two @-@ level ( binary ) signaling , so the data rate in bits per second is equal to the symbol rate in bauds .
For example with 8 @-@ N @-@ 1 character framing only 80 % of the bits are available for data ( for every eight bits of data , two more framing bits are sent ) .
Bit rates commonly supported include 75 , 110 , 300 , 1200 , 2400 , 4800 , 9600 , 19200 , 38400 , 57600 and 115200 bit / s .
Crystal oscillators with a frequency of 1.843200 MHz are sold specifically for this purpose .
This is 16 times the fastest bit rate and the serial port circuit can easily divide this down to lower frequencies as required .
Most serial communications designs send the data bits within each byte LSB ( Least significant bit ) first .
The parity bit in each character can be set to none ( N ) , odd ( O ) , even ( E ) , mark ( M ) , or space ( S ) .
Mark parity means that the parity bit is always set to the mark signal condition ( logical 1 ) and likewise space parity always sends the parity bit in the space signal condition .
Electronic devices usually use one stop bit .
= = = Conventional notation = = = The D / P / S ( Data / Parity / Stop ) conventional notation specifies the framing of a serial connection .
The most common usage on microcomputers is 8 / N / 1 ( 8N1 ) .
This specifies 8 data bits , no parity , 1 stop bit .
7 / E / 1 ( 7E1 ) means that an even parity bit is added to the seven data bits for a total of eight bits between the start and stop bits .
Common hardware handshake signals ( hardware flow control ) use the RS @-@ 232 RTS / CTS or DTR / DSR signal circuits .
Another method of flow control ( software flow control ) uses special characters such as XON / XOFF to control the flow of data .
The XON / XOFF characters are sent by the receiver to the sender to control when the sender will send data , that is , these characters go in the opposite direction to the data being sent .
On the other hand , since no extra signal circuits are required , XON / XOFF flow control can be done on a 3 wire interface .
Additionally they allow controlling the data flow , emulating all signal lines ( DTR / DSR / CTS / RTS / DCD / RI ) and customizing pinout .
For instance , virtual serial ports can share data between several applications from one GPS device connected to a serial port .
Another option is to communicate with any other serial devices via internet or LAN as if they are locally connected to computer ( Serial over LAN / Serial @-@ over @-@ Ethernet technology ) .
PCI Express is a layered protocol , consisting of a " transaction layer , " a " data link layer , " and a " physical layer . "
The Physical Layer is subdivided into logical and electrical sublayers .
Devices may optionally support wider links composed of 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , or 32 lanes .
= = = = Data transmission = = = = PCIe sends all control messages , including interrupts , over the same links used for data .
In this coding scheme every eight ( uncoded ) payload bits of data are replaced with 10 ( encoded ) bits of transmit data , causing a 20 % overhead in the electrical bandwidth .
Many other protocols ( such as SONET ) use a different form of encoding known as " scrambling " to embed clock information into data streams .
PCI Express uses credit @-@ based flow control .
The advantage of this scheme ( compared to other methods such as wait states or handshake @-@ based transfer protocols ) is that the latency of credit return does not affect performance , provided that the credit limit is not encountered .
PCIe 1.x is often quoted to support a data rate of 250 MB / s in each direction , per lane .
This figure is a calculation from the physical signaling rate ( 2.5 gigabaud ) divided by the encoding overhead ( 10 bits per byte .
) This means a sixteen lane ( × 16 ) PCIe card would then be theoretically capable of 16 × 250 MB / s = 4 GB / s in each direction .
Like other high data rate serial interconnect systems , PCIe has a protocol and processing overhead due to the additional transfer robustness ( CRC and acknowledgements ) .
Long continuous unidirectional transfers ( such as those typical in high @-@ performance storage controllers ) can approach > 95 % of PCIe 's raw ( lane ) data rate .
) But in more typical applications ( such as a USB or Ethernet controller ) , the traffic profile is characterized as short data packets with frequent enforced acknowledgements .
These include InfiniBand , RapidIO , HyperTransport , QPI , StarFabric , and MIPI LLI .
An example of such a tradeoff is adding complex header information to a transmitted packet to allow for complex routing ( PCI Express is not capable of this ) .
Also making the system hot @-@ pluggable requires that software track network topology changes .
Examples of buses suited for this purpose are InfiniBand and StarFabric .
Examples of bus protocols designed for this purpose are RapidIO and HyperTransport .
PCI Express falls somewhere in the middle , targeted by design as a system interconnect ( local bus ) rather than a device interconnect or routed network protocol .

The Geiger @-@ Müller counter , also called a Geiger counter , is an instrument used for measuring ionizing radiation .
A G @-@ M tube can detect the presence of radiation , but not its energy which influences the radiation 's ionising effect .
Consequently , instruments measuring dose rate require the use of an energy compensated G @-@ M tube , so that the dose displayed relates to the counts detected .
The readout can be analog or digital , and increasingly , modern instruments are offering serial communications with a host computer or network .

Hermann Weyl introduced the term " Lie algebra " ( after Sophus Lie ) in the 1930s .
For example , the Lie algebra of SU ( " n " ) is written as formula _ 13 .
A subspace formula _ 18 that is closed under the Lie bracket is called a Lie subalgebra .
The centralizer of formula _ 5 itself is called the center of formula _ 5 .
below .
Any one @-@ dimensional Lie algebra over a field is abelian , by the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket .
As a concrete example , consider the special linear group SL ( " n , " R ) , consisting of all " n " × " n " matrices with real entries and determinant 1 .
This is a matrix Lie group , and its Lie algebra consists of all " n " × " n " matrices with real entries and trace 0 .
In particular , this has an application to the classification of Lie groups .
More generally still , a Lie algebra formula _ 5 is said to be solvable if the derived series : : formula _ 87becomes zero eventually .
Every finite @-@ dimensional Lie algebra has a unique maximal solvable ideal , called its radical .
= = = Cartan 's criterion = = = Cartan 's criterion gives conditions for a Lie algebra to be nilpotent , solvable , or semisimple .
A Lie algebra formula _ 5 is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is nondegenerate .
Furthermore , semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field have been completely classified through their root systems .
This Lie group is not determined uniquely ; however , any two connected Lie groups with the same Lie algebra are " locally isomorphic , " and in particular , have the same universal cover .
However , when the Lie algebra formula _ 5 is finite @-@ dimensional , one can associate to it a simply connected Lie group having formula _ 5 as its Lie algebra .
More precisely , the Lie algebra functor L has a left adjoint functor Γ from finite @-@ dimensional ( real ) Lie algebras to Lie groups , factoring through the full subcategory of simply connected Lie groups .
The universal cover group above can be constructed as the image of the Lie algebra under the exponential map .
More generally , we have that the Lie algebra is homeomorphic to a neighborhood of the identity .
But globally , if the Lie group is compact , the exponential will not be injective , and if the Lie group is not connected , simply connected or compact , the exponential map need not be surjective .
If the Lie algebra is infinite @-@ dimensional , the issue is more subtle .
In many instances , the exponential map is not even locally a homeomorphism ( for example , in Diff ( S1 ) , one may find diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not in the image of exp ) .
Furthermore , some infinite @-@ dimensional Lie algebras are not the Lie algebra of any group .

Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis .
B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher , who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics .
For example , all of the moths of the same species living in an isolated forest are a population .
A gene in this population may have several alternate forms , which account for variations between the phenotypes of the organisms .
An example might be a gene for coloration in moths that has two alleles : black and white .
Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely , and thereby reduce genetic variability .
Ronald Fisher held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution , and this remained the dominant view for several decades .
In 1968 Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution which claims that most of the changes in the genetic material are caused by neutral mutations and genetic drift .
Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated , usually through genetic recombination .
These duplications are a major source of raw material for evolving new genes , with tens to hundreds of genes duplicated in animal genomes every million years .
For example , the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for color vision and one for night vision ; all four arose from a single ancestral gene .
= = = Gene flow and transfer = = = Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations , which are usually of the same species .
Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms , or the exchange of pollen .
Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer .
Immigration may add new genetic material to the established gene pool of a population .
Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges , oceans and deserts or even man @-@ made structures such as the Great Wall of China , which has hindered the flow of plant genes .
Polyploidy is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction , with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during meiosis .
= = = = Horizontal Gene Transfer = = = = " Horizontal gene transfer " is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring ; this is most common among bacteria .
Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast " Saccharomyces cerevisiae " and the adzuki bean beetle " Callosobruchus chinensis " may also have occurred .
Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms , allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains .
In reality , one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at other loci , especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome .
In the extreme case of primarily asexual populations , linkage is complete , and different population genetic equations can be derived and solved , which behave quite differently from the sexual case .
Population genetics of microorganisms is also an essential factor for devising strategies for the conservation and better utilization of beneficial microbes ( Xu , 2010 ) .
A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician R.A. Fisher .
In a series of papers beginning in 1924 , another British geneticist , J.B.S.
The work of Fisher , Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of " population genetics . "
The American George R. Price worked with both Hamilton and Maynard Smith .
American Richard Lewontin and Japanese Motoo Kimura were heavily influenced by Wright .
Theodosius Dobzhansky , a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan 's lab , had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov .
Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that , contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists , these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity , with marked differences between sub @-@ populations .
The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form .

Different countries have very different voter turnouts .
These differences are caused by a mix of cultural and institutional factors .
Studies using game theory , which takes into account the ability of voters to interact , have also found that the expected turnout for any large election should be zero .
Riker and Ordeshook developed the modern understanding of " D. "
Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook 's assumptions .
A high turnout is generally seen as evidence of the legitimacy of the current system .
In some countries , there are threats of violence against those who vote , such as during the 2005 Iraq elections , an example of voter suppression .
However , some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system .

Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation , which is the reason for the blue color of the sky and the yellow tone of the sun itself .
Scattering by particles similar to , or larger than , the wavelength of light is typically treated by the Mie theory , the discrete dipole approximation and other computational techniques .
For example , the major constituent of the atmosphere , nitrogen , has a Rayleigh cross section of at a wavelength of 532 nm ( green light ) .
The strong wavelength dependence of the scattering ( ~ " λ " − 4 ) means that shorter ( blue ) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer ( red ) wavelengths .
This results in the indirect blue light coming from all regions of the sky .
As previously stated , Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength , so that shorter wavelength violet and blue light will scatter more than the longer wavelengths ( yellow and especially red light ) .
The resulting color , which appears like a pale blue , actually is a mixture of all the scattered colors , mainly blue and green .
Viewed from space , however , the sky is black and the sun is white .
In locations with little light pollution , the moonlit night sky is also blue , because moonlight is reflected sunlight , with a slightly lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the moon .

Two main classes of leptons exist : charged leptons ( also known as the " electron @-@ like " leptons ) , and neutral leptons ( better known as neutrinos ) .
The first charged lepton , the electron , was theorized in the mid @-@ 19th century by several scientists and was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson .
The next lepton to be observed was the muon , discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936 , which was classified as a meson at the time .
After investigation , it was realized that the muon did not have the expected properties of a meson , but rather behaved like an electron , only with higher mass .
The first neutrino , the electron neutrino , was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain certain characteristics of beta decay .
It was first observed in the Cowan @-@ Reines neutrino experiment conducted by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956 .
The tau neutrino remained elusive until July 2000 , when the DONUT collaboration from Fermilab announced its discovery .
= = History = = The first lepton identified was the electron , discovered by J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists in 1897 .
Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the energy , momentum , and angular momentum of the initial and observed final particles .
Nearly 40 years after the discovery of the electron , the muon was discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936 .
Although all present data is consistent with three generations of leptons , some particle physicists are searching for a fourth generation .
In the language of quantum field theory the electromagnetic interaction of the charged leptons is expressed by the fact that the particles interact with the quantum of the electromagnetic field , the photon .

Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare himself , the " Ur @-@ Hamlet " would have been in performance by 1589 and the first version of the story known to incorporate a ghost .
No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo 's version .
Most scholars reject the idea that " Hamlet " is in any way connected with Shakespeare 's only son , Hamnet Shakespeare , who died in 1596 at age eleven .
Conventional wisdom holds that " Hamlet " is too obviously connected to legend , and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time .
He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler , the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named , was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that , in the loose orthography of the time , the names were virtually interchangeable .
Sadler 's first name is spelled " Hamlett " in Shakespeare 's will .
As " Hamlet " was very popular , Bernard Lott , the series editor of " New Swan , " believes it " unlikely that he would have overlooked ... so significant a piece . "

Theobald 's version became standard for a long time , and his " full text " approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day .
This view changed drastically in the 18th century , when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero - a pure , brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances .
By the mid @-@ 18th century , however , the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings , returning madness and the Ghost to the forefront .
These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism , which came to focus more on character and less on plot .
By the 19th century , Romantic critics valued " Hamlet " for its internal , individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general .
In " Hamlet , " Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the soliloquies , not the action , that the audience learns Hamlet 's motives and thoughts .
At one point , as in the Gravedigger scene , Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius : in the next scene , however , when Claudius appears , he is suddenly tame .

According to the majority of authorities , i.e.
Although the B5N was substantially faster and more capable than its Allied counterparts , the TBD Devastator , Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore , it was nearing obsolescence by 1941 .
The B5N carried a crew of three : pilot , navigator / bombardier / observer , and radio operator / gunner .
= = Design and development = = The B5N was designed by a team led by Katsuji Nakamura in response to a 1935 specification by the Navy for a torpedo bomber to replace the Yokosuka B4Y .
Internally designated Type K by Nakajima , it successfully competed with the Mitsubishi B5M for a production contract .
Keen to maintain the high performance of the type , the Navy was reluctant to add weight in the form of armor , and instead looked to obtaining a faster version of the aircraft in the hopes of outrunning enemy fighters .
The B5N2 was given a much more powerful engine , and various modifications were made to streamline it .

This contrasts with classical particles , which can have any energy .
These discrete values are called energy levels .
If the potential energy is set to zero at infinite distance from the atomic nucleus or molecule , the usual convention , then bound electron states have negative potential energy .
If an atom , ion , or molecule is at the lowest possible energy level , it and its electrons are said to be in the " ground state . "
If more than one quantum mechanical state is at the same energy , the energy levels are " degenerate . "
They are then called degenerate energy levels .
For a confined particle such as an electron in an atom , the wave function has the form of standing waves .
Elementary examples that show mathematically how energy levels come about are the particle in a box and the quantum harmonic oscillator .
= = History = = The first evidence of quantization in atoms was the observation of spectral lines in light from the sun in the early 1800s by Joseph von Fraunhofer and William Hyde Wollaston .
The notion of energy levels was proposed in 1913 by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in the Bohr theory of the atom .
The energy of its state is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction of the ( negative ) electron with the ( positive ) nucleus .
= = = = Multi @-@ electron atoms include electrostatic interaction of an electron with other electrons = = = = If there is more than one electron around the atom , electron @-@ electron @-@ interactions raise the energy level .
These interactions are often neglected if the spatial overlap of the electron wavefunctions is low .
For multi @-@ electron atoms , interactions between electrons cause the preceding equation to be no longer accurate as stated simply with as the atomic number .
: formula _ 3In such cases , the orbital types ( determined by the azimuthal quantum number ) as well as their levels within the molecule affect and therefore also affect the various atomic electron energy levels .
The Aufbau principle of filling an atom with electrons for an electron configuration takes these differing energy levels into account .
For filling an atom with electrons in the ground state , the lowest energy levels are filled first and consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle , the Aufbau principle , and Hund 's rule .
The interaction energy therefore becomes : formula _ 8 .
The energy level of the bonding orbitals is lower , and the energy level of the antibonding orbitals is higher .
A non @-@ bonding orbital in a molecule is an orbital with electrons in outer shells which do not participate in bonding and its energy level is the same as that of the constituent atom .
The specific energies of these components vary with the specific energy state and the substance .
In molecular physics and quantum chemistry , an energy level is a quantized energy of a bound quantum mechanical state .
= = = Energy level diagrams = = = There are various types of energy level diagrams for bonds between atoms in a molecule .
Electrons can also be completely removed from a chemical species such as an atom , molecule , or ion .
If an atom , ion , or molecule is at the lowest possible energy level , it and its electrons are said to be in the " ground state . "
Such a species can be excited to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the levels .
A photon 's energy is equal to Planck 's constant ( ) times its frequency ( ) and thus is proportional to its frequency , or inversely to its wavelength ( ) .
Conduction of heat typically occurs as molecules or atoms collide transferring the heat between each other .
A subsequent drop of an electron to a lower energy level can release a photon , causing a possibly colored glow .
An electron farther from the nucleus has higher potential energy than an electron closer to the nucleus , thus it becomes less bound to the nucleus , since its potential energy is negative and inversely dependent on its distance from the nucleus .
At first this appears to be an exception to the requirement for energy levels .

Ununoctium is the temporary IUPAC name for the transactinide element with the atomic number 118 and temporary element symbol Uuo .
It has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all the elements discovered so far .
Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds , theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions , including some unexpected ones .
For example , although ununoctium is a member of group 18 , it may possibly not be a noble gas , unlike all the other group 18 elements .
It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects .
= = History = = = = = Unsuccessful synthesis attempts = = = In late 1998 , Polish physicist Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms , including ununoctium .
In June 2002 , the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov .
= = Naming = = Until the 1960s ununoctium was known as " eka @-@ emanation " ( emanation is the old name for radon ) .
The Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006 .
These names were later proposed for element 114 ( flerovium ) and element 116 ( moscovium ) .
Some isotopes with many more neutrons , such as some located around 313Uuo could also provide longer @-@ lived nuclei .
= = = Calculated atomic and physical properties = = = Ununoctium is a member of group 18 , the zero @-@ valence elements .
The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions ( for example , combustion ) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons .
This produces a stable , minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound .
The bonding between ununoctium and hydrogen in UuoH is predicted to be very limp and can be regarded as a pure van der Waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond .
This is a result of the same spin @-@ orbit interactions that make ununoctium unusually reactive .
For example , it was shown that the reaction of ununoctium with to form the compound would release an energy of 106 kcal / mol of which about 46 kcal / mol come from these interactions .
For comparison , the spin @-@ orbit interaction for the similar molecule is about 10 kcal / mol out of a formation energy of 49 kcal / mol .

Aerodynamics is a sub @-@ field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics , and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields .
Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century , although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag have been recorded much earlier .
The Navier @-@ Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and are difficult to solve .
Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel , the Wright brothers flew the first powered aircraft on December 17 , 1903 .
During the time of the first flights , Frederick W. Lanchester , Martin Wilhelm Kutta , and Nikolai Zhukovsky independently created theories that connected circulation of a fluid flow to lift .
Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two @-@ dimensional wing theory .
As aircraft speed increased , designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound .
The differences in air flows under these conditions led to problems in aircraft control , increased drag due to shock waves , and structural dangers due to aeroelastic flutter .
The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach , who was one of the first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow .
In many aerodynamics problems , the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight : lift , drag , thrust , and weight .
Of these , lift and drag are aerodynamic forces , i.e.
Subsonic flows are flow fields in which air velocity throughout the entire flow is below the local speed of sound .
Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound .
Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere .
A fourth classification , hypersonic flow , refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound .
Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow .
In some flow fields , viscous effects are very small , and solutions may neglect to account for viscous effects .
Finally , aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment .
On a molecular level , flow fields are made up of many individual collisions between gas molecules and between gas molecules and solid surfaces .
This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined anywhere within the flow .
For example , many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions , where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers .
In its most complete form , the momentum conservation equations are known as the Navier @-@ Stokes equations .
The Navier @-@ Stokes equations have no known analytical solution , and are solved in modern aerodynamics using computational techniques .
Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations , simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate to specific applications .
= = Branches of aerodynamics = = Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow , including flow speed , compressibility , and viscosity .
Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics .
For instance , internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe .
Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow speed is below , near or above the speed of sound .
Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow ; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic .
The approximations to these problems are called inviscid flows .
= = = Incompressible aerodynamics = = = An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space .
= = = = Subsonic flow = = = = Subsonic ( or low @-@ speed ) aerodynamics studies fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow .
There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid , incompressible and irrotational .
This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations used to be a simplified version of the governing equations of fluid dynamics , thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions .
In general , this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3 .
= = = = Transonic flow = = = = The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local speed of sound ( generally taken as Mach 0.8 @-@ 1.2 ) .
Between these speeds , some of the airflow is supersonic , and some is not .
= = = = Supersonic flow = = = = Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound .
Calculating the lift on the Concorde during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem .
Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave , viscous interaction , and chemical dissociation of gas .
This principle makes aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically .
This includes low momentum diffusion , high momentum convection , and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time .
Flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow .
It is found in Argentina , southern Brazil and Paraguay .
This species is sometimes considered a subspecies of " Mazama rufina . "

= = History = = December 1 , 1968 saw the breaking of ground for the linear accelerator ( linac ) .
This would become the 6.4 km circumference Fermilab 's Main Ring .
The linac first 200 MeV beam started on December 1 , 1970 .
The booster first 8 GeV beam was produced on May 20 , 1971 .
On June 30 , 1971 , a proton beam was guided for the first time through the entire National Accelerator Laboratory accelerator system including the Main Ring .
A series of milestones saw acceleration rise to 20 GeV on January 22 , 1972 to 53 GeV on February 4 and to 100 GeV on February 11 .
On March 1 , 1972 , the then NAL accelerator system accelerated for the first time a beam of protons to its design energy of 200 GeV .
On 14 May 1976 Fermilab took its protons all the way to 500 GeV .
This achievement provided the opportunity to introduce a new energy scale , the teraelectronvolt ( TeV ) , equal to 1000 GeV .
The Main Ring continued to serve as an injector for the Tevatron until the Main Injector was completed in 2000 .
On October 21 , 1986 acceleration at the Tevatron was pushed to 900 GeV , providing a first proton @-@ antiproton collision at 1.8 TeV on November 30 , 1986 .
Tevatron collider Run II begun on March 1 , 2001 after successful completion of that facility upgrade .
The Tevatron ceased operations on 30 September 2011 .
The Booster is a small circular synchrotron , around which the protons pass up to 20,000 times to attain an energy of around 8 GeV .
It can accelerate protons up to 150 GeV ; it can produce 120 GeV protons for antiproton creation ; it can increase antiproton energy to 150 GeV and it can inject protons or antiprotons into the Tevatron .
The ring can then pass the antiprotons to the Main Injector .
The Tevatron can accelerate the particles from the Main Injector up to 980 GeV .
The protons and antiprotons are accelerated in opposite directions , crossing paths in the CDF and DØ detectors to collide at 1.96 TeV .
Another 240 NbTi quadrupole magnets are used to focus the beam .
On September 27 , 1993 the cryogenic cooling system of the Tevatron Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers .

The star reaches the main sequence when the core reaches a temperature high enough to begin fusing hydrogen ( a few million kelvin ) and establishes hydrostatic equilibrium .
Over its main sequence life , the star slowly converts the hydrogen in the core into helium ; its main @-@ sequence life ends when nearly all the hydrogen in the core has been fused .
When the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core , nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity .
Once the star is fusing helium in its core , it contracts and is no longer considered a red giant .
In stars massive enough to ignite helium fusion , an analogous process occurs when the central helium is exhausted and the star collapses once again , causing helium in an outer shell to begin fusing .
At the same time hydrogen may begin fusion in a shell just outside the burning helium shell .
The helium fusion results in the build up of a carbon @-@ oxygen core .
If the star has about 0.2 to , it is massive enough to become a red giant but does not have enough mass to initiate the fusion of helium .

After working odd jobs in the first months of the Depression , Hanna joined the Harman and Ising animation studio in 1930 .
In 1937 , while working at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) , Hanna met Joseph Barbera .
In 1967 , Hanna @-@ Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $ 12 million , but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991 .
Hanna and Barbera won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards .
= = Personal life = = William Hanna was born to William John and Avice Joyce ( Denby ) Hanna in Melrose , New Mexico .
He was the third of seven children and the only boy .
When Hanna was three years old , the family moved to Baker City , Oregon , where his father worked on the Balm Creek Dam .
During the next two years they moved several times before eventually settling in Watts , California , in 1919 .
In 1922 , while living in Watts , he joined Scouting .
He attended Compton High School from 1925 through 1928 , where he played the saxophone in a dance band .
Hanna became an Eagle Scout as a youth and remained active in Scouting throughout his life .
As an adult , he served as a Scoutmaster and was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1985 .
Despite his numerous career @-@ related awards , Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award .
In 1996 , Hanna , with assistance from Los Angeles writer Tom Ito , published his autobiography - Joe Barbera had published his two years earlier .
While working there , Hanna 's talent for drawing became evident , and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio , which had created the " Looney Tunes " and " Merrie Melodies " series .
Despite a lack of formal training , Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department .
For the first several years of Hanna 's employment , the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art 's Leon Schlesinger , who released the Harman @-@ Ising output through Warner Bros.
= = Tom and Jerry = = In 1940 , Hanna and Barbera jointly directed " Puss Gets the Boot , " which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best ( Cartoon ) Short Subject .
By this time , however , Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising , to whom he felt very loyal .
Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby , who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing " Puss Gets the Boot , " he never actually worked on it .
Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat @-@ and @-@ mouse idea .
The result was their most famous creation , " Tom and Jerry . "
Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because : " We knew we needed two characters .
We thought we needed conflict , and chase and action .
And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good , basic thought .
Over the next 17 years Hanna and Barbera worked almost exclusively on " Tom and Jerry , " directing more than 114 highly popular cartoon shorts .
During World War II they also made animated training films .
Nonetheless , the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short , " The Yankee Doodle Mouse " ( 1943 ) - a war @-@ time adventure .
Quimby accepted each Academy Award for " Tom and Jerry 's " without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage .
Hanna and Barbera found the no @-@ notice closing puzzling because " Tom and Jerry " had been so successful .
= = Television = = During his last year at MGM , Hanna branched out into television , forming the short @-@ lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator Jay Ward , who had created the series " Crusader Rabbit . "
Their partnership soon ended , and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release .
The two brought different skills to the company ; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist , while Hanna had a gift for timing , story construction , and recruiting top artists .
A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company , first called H @-@ B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna @-@ Barbera Productions .
The first offering from the new company was " The Ruff & Reddy Show , " a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat .
Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture , " Loopy De Loop , " Hanna @-@ Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series : " The Huckleberry Hound Show " and " The Yogi Bear Show . "
A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of " Huckleberry Hound " were adults .
A parody of " The Honeymooners , " the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances , talking animals , and celebrity guests .
Fred Flintstone 's signature exclamation " yabba dabba doo " soon entered everyday usage , and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field .
By the late 1960s , Hanna @-@ Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business .
The Hanna @-@ Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half @-@ hour television shows .
The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland , Jack and the Beanstalk , Cyrano de Bergerac as well as the feature @-@ length film " Charlotte 's Web " ( 1973 ) .
Hanna and Barbera remained at the head of the company until 1991 .

In physics , particularly electromagnetism , the Lorentz force is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields .
The first derivation of the Lorentz force is commonly attributed to Oliver Heaviside in 1889 , although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by James Clerk Maxwell .
Hendrik Lorentz derived it a few years after Heaviside .
More explicitly stated : : formula _ 2in which r is the position vector of the charged particle , " t " is time , and the overdot is a time derivative .
According to some definitions , the term " Lorentz force " refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force , with the " total " electromagnetic force ( including the electric force ) given some other ( nonstandard ) name .
The magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current @-@ carrying wire in a magnetic field .
However , in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive .
In all these descriptions , the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields .
J. J. Thomson was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell 's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object 's properties and external fields .
Finally , in 1892 , Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields .
Thus , Maxwell 's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws , but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities .
The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect ; the generation of E and B by currents and charges is another .
In real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the behavior of charged particles , both in principle and as a matter of computation .
The charged particles in a material medium both respond to the E and B fields and generate these fields .
See for example , Green @-@ Kubo relations and Green 's function ( many @-@ body theory ) .
= = Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B = = In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism , the Lorentz force Law is used as the " definition " of the electric and magnetic fields E and B.
So the two vector fields E and B are thereby defined throughout space and time , and these are called the " electric field " and " magnetic field . "
See for example Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron light .
These effects occur through both a direct effect ( called the radiation reaction force ) and indirectly ( by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents ) .
When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field , the magnetic force tries to push electrons through the wire , and this creates the EMF .
In other electrical generators , the magnets move , while the conductors do not .
Both of these EMF 's , despite their different origins , can be described by the same equation , namely , the EMF is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the wire .
) Einstein 's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects .
The " sign " of the EMF is determined by Lenz 's law .
The reverse is also true , the Lorentz force and the Maxwell Equations can be used to derive the Faraday Law .
Let Σ ( " t " ) be the moving wire , moving together without rotation and with constant velocity v and Σ ( " t " ) be the internal surface of the wire .
So we have , the Maxwell Faraday equation : : formula _ 17The two are equivalent if the wire is not moving .
Using Lagrange 's equations , the equation for the Lorentz force can be obtained .

The SI unit of capacitance is the farad ( symbol : F ) , named after the English physicist Michael Faraday .
A 1 farad capacitor , when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge , has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates .
Historically , a farad was regarded as an inconveniently large unit , both electrically and physically .
Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries .
The energy ( measured in joules ) stored in a capacitor is equal to the " work " done to charge it .
The energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating this equation .
The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the microfarad ( µF ) , nanofarad ( nF ) , picofarad ( pF ) , and , in microcircuits , femtofarad ( fF ) .
However , specially made supercapacitors can be much larger ( as much as hundreds of farads ) , and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad .
The closer the sheets are to each other , the greater the capacitance .
In CGS units the equation has the form : : formula _ 6where " C " in this case has the units of length .
See , for example , linear response function .
The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time .
These resonances are the basis for a number of experimental techniques for detecting defects .
The definition C = Q / V still holds for a single plate given a charge , in which case the field lines produced by that charge terminate as if the plate were at the center of an oppositely charged sphere at infinity .
Hermann von Helmholtz and Sir William Thomson showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric , so that formula _ 20 , etc .
The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere , of infinite radius , centered on the conductor .
Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits ( an effect called crosstalk ) , and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at high frequency .
This is trivial in cases with high symmetry .
In nanoscale capacitors , however , the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device .
The definition of capacitance , : formula _ 28 , with the potential difference : formula _ 29may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons , : formula _ 30 and formula _ 31 .
Then : formula _ 32is the " quantum capacitance " of the device .
The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic ( conventional ) capacitors are the number of excess electrons ( charge carrier , or electrons that contribute to the device 's electronic behavior ) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes .
