and the ear@@ th brought forth gr@@ ass , and her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after his kind , and the tree yi@@ el@@ ding fruit , whose se@@ ed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made the be@@ ast of the ear@@ th after his kind , and c@@ attle after their kind , and every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
these are the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens ,
in the swe@@ at of TH@@ Y face s@@ halt th@@ ou eat bread , ti@@ ll th@@ ou return un@@ to the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast th@@ ou taken : for d@@ ust th@@ ou art , and un@@ to d@@ ust s@@ halt th@@ ou return .
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den Cher@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and a f@@ laming s@@ word which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and it came to pass , when men began to multi@@ ply on the face of the ear@@ th , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born un@@ to them ,
that the sons of God saw the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wi@@ ves of all which they chose .
and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
but with the@@ e will I establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt come into the Ar@@ k , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y wife , and TH@@ Y sons ' wi@@ ves with the@@ e .
and of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , two of every sort s@@ halt th@@ ou bring into the Ar@@ k , to keep them alive with the@@ e ; they shall be male and female .
of fo@@ w@@ ls after their kind , and of c@@ attle after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ear@@ th after his kind , two of every sort shall come un@@ to the@@ e , to keep them alive .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the ear@@ th for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; and every living sub@@ stance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and No@@ ah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves with him , into the Ar@@ k , because of the waters of the flood .
in the sel@@ f@@ same day entered No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , into the Ar@@ k ;
they , and every be@@ ast after his kind , and all the c@@ attle after their kind , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind , and every fo@@ w@@ l after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and the flood was for@@ ty days upon the ear@@ th ; and the waters increased , and b@@ are up the Ar@@ k , and it was lift up above the ear@@ th .
and God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , and every living thing , and all the c@@ attle that was with him in the Ar@@ k : and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th , and the waters ass@@ w@@ aged ;
and the waters decreased continu@@ ally until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it upon both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , and went back@@ ward , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father ; and their faces were back@@ ward , and they saw not their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Ger@@ ar , un@@ to Gaza ; as th@@ ou go@@ est , un@@ to So@@ dom , and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ im , even un@@ to L@@ as@@ ha .
and it came to pass , as they jour@@ ne@@ yed from the east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar ; and they d@@ wel@@ t there .
and the Lord said , be@@ hold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be re@@ strained from them , which they have imag@@ ined to do .
therefore is the name of it called Bab@@ el ; because the Lord did there con@@ found the language of all the ear@@ th : and from th@@ ence did the Lord sc@@ at@@ ter them abroad upon the face of all the ear@@ th .
and Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took them wi@@ ves : the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai ; and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an , the father of Mil@@ ca@@ h , and the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land : and Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; for the fam@@ ine was gri@@ ev@@ ous in the land .
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall see the@@ e , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save the@@ e alive .
why sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou , S@@ he is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore be@@ hold TH@@ Y wife , take her , and go TH@@ Y way .
and there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's c@@ attle and the her@@ d@@ men of lot 's c@@ attle : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite d@@ wel@@ led then in the land .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the pla@@ in of Mam@@ re the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were conf@@ eder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smo@@ te them , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine he@@ ir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bo@@ wel@@ s shall be th@@ ine he@@ ir .
and Sar@@ ai Ab@@ ram 's wife took Hag@@ ar her ma@@ id the Egyptian , after Ab@@ ram had d@@ wel@@ t ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to her husband Ab@@ ram to be his wife .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the@@ e and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e in their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God un@@ to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e .
and as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard the@@ e : be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly ; twelve pr@@ inces shall he be@@ get , and I will make him a great nation .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of So@@ dom , comp@@ ass@@ ed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the mid@@ st of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which lot d@@ wel@@ t .
and lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he fear@@ ed to d@@ well in Zo@@ ar : and he d@@ wel@@ t in a cave , he and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger ar@@ ose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
and he commun@@ ed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and in@@ treat for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , current money with the mer@@ chan@@ t .
and after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re : the same is He@@ br@@ on in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and I will make the@@ e swe@@ ar by the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , and the God of the ear@@ th , that th@@ ou s@@ halt not take a wife un@@ to my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I d@@ well :
and the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls of the ca@@ me@@ ls of his master , and depar@@ ted ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , un@@ to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and he made his ca@@ me@@ ls to k@@ ne@@ el down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and the dam@@ sel was very fair to look upon , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
and the ser@@ vant brought forth je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother pre@@ ci@@ ous things .
and I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the ev@@ enti@@ de : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , the ca@@ me@@ ls were coming .
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ ed@@ ar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
and these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the gh@@ ost and died ; and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah to wife , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , the sister to Lab@@ an the Syrian .
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to multi@@ ply as the stars of heav@@ en , and will give un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed all these countries ; and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was spor@@ ting with Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife .
for all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them , and filled them with ear@@ th .
and it came to pass the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dig@@ ged , and said un@@ to him , We have found water .
go now to the flock , and f@@ et@@ ch me from th@@ ence two good kids of the go@@ ats ; and I will make them sav@@ our@@ y meat for TH@@ Y father , such as he lov@@ eth :
and I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling shall be the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th , and of the dew of heav@@ en from above ;
and by TH@@ Y s@@ word s@@ halt th@@ ou live , and s@@ halt serve TH@@ Y brother ; and it shall come to pass when th@@ ou s@@ halt have the domin@@ ion , that th@@ ou s@@ halt break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
and he dre@@ amed , and be@@ hold a la@@ d@@ der set up on the ear@@ th , and the top of it reached to heav@@ en : and be@@ hold the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil upon the top of it .
and th@@ ither were all the f@@ loc@@ ks gathered : and they rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the she@@ ep , and put the stone again upon the well 's m@@ outh in his place .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in un@@ to her .
and it came to pass , when R@@ ach@@ el had born Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to Lab@@ an , S@@ end me away , that I may go un@@ to mine own place , and to my country .
and he set the ro@@ ds which he had pil@@ led before the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering t@@ rough@@ s when the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink , that they should conce@@ ive when they came to drink .
and it came to pass , wh@@ en@@ so@@ ever the stronger c@@ attle did conce@@ ive , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the c@@ attle in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds .
and he said , L@@ if@@ t up now th@@ ine eyes , and see , all the r@@ ams which le@@ ap upon the c@@ attle are r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led : for I have seen all that Lab@@ an do@@ eth un@@ to the@@ e .
and Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two ma@@ id@@ servants ' ten@@ ts ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now therefore come th@@ ou , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , I and th@@ ou ; and let it be for a witness between me and the@@ e .
then Jac@@ o@@ b offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his bre@@ th@@ ren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tar@@ ried all night in the mount .
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the mer@@ cies , and of all the truth , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and when he saw that he prev@@ ailed not against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh ; and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
and Jac@@ o@@ b came to S@@ hal@@ em , a city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am ; and pit@@ ched his tent before the city .
and when Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , pr@@ ince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and def@@ iled her .
and the young man def@@ er@@ red not to do the thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter : and he was more honour@@ able than all the house of his father .
and they sle@@ w Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went out .
they took their she@@ ep , and their ox@@ en , and their ass@@ es , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an alt@@ ar un@@ to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b all the st@@ range go@@ ds which were in their hand , and all their ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that is , Be@@ the@@ l , he and all the people that were with him .
and Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he talked with him , even a pil@@ lar of stone : and he p@@ oured a drink offering there@@ on , and he p@@ oured oil there@@ on .
and Hus@@ ham died , and Had@@ ad the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , who smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and these are the names of the duk@@ es that came of E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duk@@ e Tim@@ n@@ ah , Duk@@ e Al@@ v@@ ah , Duk@@ e J@@ eth@@ eth ,
come now therefore , and let us s@@ lay him , and cast him into some p@@ it , and we will say , Some ev@@ il be@@ ast hat@@ h dev@@ oured him : and we shall see what will become of his dre@@ ams .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his co@@ at , his co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a p@@ it : and the p@@ it was empty , there was no water in it .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , which had brought him down th@@ ither .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , After this manner did TH@@ Y ser@@ vant to me ; that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
and the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they did there , he was the do@@ er of it .
and in the v@@ ine were three branches : and it was as though it bud@@ ded , and her b@@ los@@ s@@ oms shot forth ; and the clu@@ sters there@@ of brought forth ri@@ pe grap@@ es :
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand : and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up th@@ ine head , and restore the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y place : and th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , after the former manner when th@@ ou w@@ ast his Butler .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up TH@@ Y head from off the@@ e , and shall han@@ g the@@ e on a tree ; and the birds shall eat TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h from off the@@ e .
and it came to pass the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast un@@ to all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed ; and stood by the other k@@ ine upon the br@@ ink of the river .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for bad@@ ness :
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it could not be known that they had e@@ aten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up cor@@ n under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land per@@ ish not through the fam@@ ine .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in ves@@ tures of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ;
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the fam@@ ine was over all the face of the ear@@ th : and Joseph opened all the sto@@ re@@ houses , and sold un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and the fam@@ ine wa@@ xed sor@@ e in the land of Egypt .
and he said , be@@ hold , I have heard that there is cor@@ n in Egypt : get you down th@@ ither , and buy for us from th@@ ence ; that we may live , and not die .
and he turned himself about from them , and we@@ pt ; and returned to them again , and commun@@ ed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph comman@@ ded to fill their s@@ acks with cor@@ n , and to restore every man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he un@@ to them .
and as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the In@@ n , he es@@ p@@ ied his money ; for , be@@ hold , it was in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the m@@ outh of your s@@ acks , carry it again in your hand ; per@@ ad@@ venture it was an over@@ sight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they commun@@ ed with him at the door of the house ,
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bo@@ wed themselves to him to the ear@@ th .
and put my c@@ up , the silver c@@ up , in the s@@ ack 's m@@ outh of the youngest , and his cor@@ n money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again un@@ to the@@ e out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we ste@@ al out of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house silver or gold ?
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cri@@ ed , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hat@@ h made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lor@@ d of all his house , and a ru@@ ler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the f@@ ame there@@ of was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren are come : and it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
and take your father and your households , and come un@@ to me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the f@@ at of the land .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said un@@ to them : and when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b their father revi@@ ved :
and Joseph made ready his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ h@@ en , and presented himself un@@ to him ; and he fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
and Joseph placed his father and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very sor@@ e , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the cor@@ n which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and now TH@@ Y two sons , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which were born un@@ to the@@ e in the land of Egypt before I came un@@ to the@@ e into Egypt , are mine ; as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near un@@ to him .
O my sou@@ l , come not th@@ ou into their secret ; un@@ to their assembly , mine honour , be not th@@ ou united : for in their an@@ ger they sle@@ w a man , and in their sel@@ f@@ will they dig@@ ged down a wall .
but his bo@@ w abo@@ de in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty God of Jac@@ o@@ b ; ( from th@@ ence is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel : )
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : and this is it that their father sp@@ ake un@@ to them , and b@@ les@@ sed them ; every one according to his b@@ les@@ sing he b@@ les@@ sed them .
and when Jac@@ o@@ b had made an end of comman@@ ding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost , and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father : and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , and all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place of E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
and the king of Egypt sp@@ ake to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of which the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah :
and the daughter of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h came down to was@@ h her@@ self at the river ; and her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ar@@ k among the flags , she sent her ma@@ id to f@@ et@@ ch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , be@@ hold , the bab@@ e we@@ pt . and she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Mos@@ es was grown , that he went out un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and looked on their bur@@ den@@ s : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian s@@ mit@@ ing an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he sle@@ w the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to s@@ lay Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
now Mos@@ es kept the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro his father in law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian : and he led the flock to the back@@ side of the de@@ sert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Ho@@ re@@ b .
moreover he said , I am the God of TH@@ Y father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . and Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
now therefore , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel is come un@@ to me : and I have also seen the op@@ pression where@@ with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
and he said , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand into TH@@ Y bos@@ om again . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om again ; and p@@ lu@@ cked it out of his bos@@ om , and , be@@ hold , it was turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe the@@ e , neither he@@ arken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to him , and put words in his m@@ outh : and I will be with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be TH@@ Y spokesman un@@ to the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to the@@ e instead of a m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be to him instead of God .
and Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Mos@@ es took the ro@@ d of God in his hand .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age , where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers .
and I have also heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge ; and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , and gave them a charge un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to wife ; and she b@@ are him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took him one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el to wife ; and she b@@ are him Ph@@ ine@@ has : these are the heads of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are they which sp@@ ake to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , S@@ ay un@@ to Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with TH@@ Y ro@@ d over the stre@@ ams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and the Lord shall sever between the c@@ attle of Israel and the c@@ attle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not one of the c@@ attle of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . and the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was har@@ dened , and he did not let the people go .
for I will at this time send all my plagu@@ es upon th@@ ine heart , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
and in very de@@ ed for this cause have I raised the@@ e up , for to she@@ w in the@@ e my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th .
be@@ hold , to mor@@ row about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as hat@@ h not been in Egypt since the foundation there@@ of even until now .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d toward heav@@ en : and the Lord sent Th@@ under and ha@@ il , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord ra@@ ined ha@@ il upon the land of Egypt .
so there was ha@@ il , and fire min@@ g@@ led with the ha@@ il , very gri@@ ev@@ ous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the ha@@ il smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and be@@ ast ; and the ha@@ il smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and br@@ ake every tree of the field .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
and the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very gri@@ ev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a m@@ igh@@ ty strong west wind , which took away the loc@@ ust@@ s , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the co@@ asts of Egypt .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let every man bor@@ row of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lam@@ b , let him and his neighbour next un@@ to his house take it according to the number of the so@@ ul@@ s ; every man according to his e@@ ating shall make your count for the lam@@ b .
and ye shall keep it up until the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the up@@ per door post of the houses , where@@ in they shall eat it .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remain@@ eth of it until the morning ye shall bur@@ n with fire .
and ye shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this sel@@ f@@ same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hat@@ h promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the sel@@ f@@ same day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed un@@ to the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
that th@@ ou s@@ halt set apart un@@ to the Lord all that open@@ eth the mat@@ ri@@ x , and every fir@@ st@@ ling that co@@ me@@ th of a be@@ ast which th@@ ou h@@ ast ; the mal@@ es shall be the Lord 's .
but God led the people about , through the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up har@@ n@@ essed out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but lift th@@ ou up TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on d@@ ry ground through the mid@@ st of the sea .
and I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea upon the d@@ ry ground : and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked un@@ to the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans through the pil@@ lar of fire and of the cl@@ oud , and troubled the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it ; and the Lord over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then san@@ g Mos@@ es and the children of Israel this song un@@ to the Lord , and sp@@ ake , saying , I will sing un@@ to the Lord , for he hat@@ h tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously : the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der hat@@ h he thrown into the sea .
fear and dre@@ ad shall fall upon them ; by the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; ti@@ ll TH@@ Y people pass over , O Lord , ti@@ ll the people pass over , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and it came to pass , as Aaron sp@@ ake un@@ to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the cl@@ oud .
and it came to pass , that at even the qu@@ ails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when they did M@@ ete it with an O@@ mer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to Mos@@ es ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and stan@@ k : and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for one man : and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came un@@ to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed : and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
when J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife un@@ to Mos@@ es into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where he en@@ camp@@ ed at the mount of God :
and Mos@@ es went out to meet his father in law , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and k@@ is@@ sed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God : and Aaron came , and all the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father in law before God .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
for they were depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and were come to the de@@ sert of S@@ ina@@ i , and had pit@@ ched in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel camp@@ ed before the mount .
and Mos@@ es went up un@@ to God , and the Lord called un@@ to him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obe@@ y my voice indeed , and keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , then ye shall be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure un@@ to me above all people : for all the ear@@ th is mine :
and the Lord came down upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Mos@@ es up to the top of the mount ; and Mos@@ es went up .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make un@@ to the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's wife , nor his man@@ ser@@ vant , nor his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , nor his o@@ x , nor his ass , nor any thing that is TH@@ Y neighbour 's .
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t make me an alt@@ ar of stone , th@@ ou s@@ halt not build it of he@@ wn stone : for if th@@ ou lift up TH@@ Y tool upon it , th@@ ou h@@ ast pollu@@ ted it .
if she ple@@ ase not her master , who hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her un@@ to a st@@ range nation he shall have no power , seeing he hat@@ h dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully with her .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smo@@ te him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
or if it be known that the o@@ x hat@@ h used to push in time past , and his owner hat@@ h not kept him in ; he shall su@@ rely pay o@@ x for o@@ x ; and the dead shall be his own .
if the th@@ i@@ ef be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought un@@ to the judges , to see whether he have put his hand un@@ to his neighbour 's goods .
for that is his covering only , it is his ra@@ im@@ ent for his s@@ kin : where@@ in shall he sle@@ ep ? and it shall come to pass , when he cri@@ eth un@@ to me , that I will hear ; for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
and in all things that I have said un@@ to you be circum@@ sp@@ ect : and make no mention of the name of other go@@ ds , neither let it be heard out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
for mine Angel shall go before the@@ e , and bring the@@ e in un@@ to the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites : and I will cut them off .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall b@@ less TH@@ Y bread , and TH@@ Y water ; and I will take si@@ ck@@ ness away from the mid@@ st of the@@ e .
and the sight of the gl@@ ory of the Lord was like dev@@ our@@ ing fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Mos@@ es went into the mid@@ st of the cl@@ oud , and g@@ at him up into the mount : and Mos@@ es was in the mount for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights .
according to all that I she@@ w the@@ e , after the pat@@ tern of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the pat@@ tern of all the instruments there@@ of , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : two cu@@ bi@@ ts and a half shall be the length there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the he@@ ight there@@ of .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay it with p@@ ure gold , within and without s@@ halt th@@ ou over@@ lay it , and s@@ halt make upon it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt cast four r@@ ings of gold for it , and put them in the four cor@@ ners there@@ of ; and two r@@ ings shall be in the one side of it , and two r@@ ings in the other side of it .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put the st@@ aves into the r@@ ings by the sides of the Ar@@ k , that the Ar@@ k may be bor@@ ne with them .
and make one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the one end , and the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the other end : even of the mer@@ cy seat shall ye make the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the two ends there@@ of .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms shall stretch forth their w@@ ings on high , covering the mer@@ cy seat with their w@@ ings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mer@@ cy seat shall the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms be .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to it a border of an hand b@@ read@@ th round about , and th@@ ou s@@ halt make a golden cro@@ wn to the border there@@ of round about .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make the dis@@ hes there@@ of , and sp@@ o@@ ons there@@ of , and covers there@@ of , and bo@@ w@@ ls there@@ of , to cover with@@ al : of p@@ ure gold s@@ halt th@@ ou make them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make lo@@ ops of blue upon the edge of the one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling ; and likewise s@@ halt th@@ ou make in the ut@@ ter@@ most edge of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
and the re@@ mn@@ ant that remain@@ eth of the cur@@ tains of the tent , the half cur@@ tain that remain@@ eth , shall han@@ g over the back@@ side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay the boards with gold , and make their r@@ ings of gold for places for the bars : and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay the bars with gold .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the table without the v@@ ail , and the cand@@ le@@ stick over against the table on the side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle toward the south : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put the table on the north side .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make the hor@@ ns of it upon the four cor@@ ners there@@ of : his hor@@ ns shall be of the same : and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay it with br@@ ass .
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be han@@ g@@ ings of an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and his twenty pil@@ lars and their twenty so@@ c@@ kets of br@@ ass ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets of silver .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set in it sett@@ ings of stones , even four ro@@ ws of stones : the first row shall be a sar@@ di@@ us , a top@@ az , and a car@@ bun@@ cle : this shall be the first row .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make two r@@ ings of gold , and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them upon the two ends of the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te in the border there@@ of , which is in the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d in@@ ward .
and two other r@@ ings of gold th@@ ou s@@ halt make , and s@@ halt put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part there@@ of , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and ben@@ e@@ ath upon the hem of it th@@ ou s@@ halt make po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , round about the hem there@@ of ; and bel@@ ls of gold between them round about :
and it shall be upon Aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he go@@ eth in un@@ to the hol@@ y place before the Lord , and when he co@@ me@@ th out , that he die not .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it on a blue la@@ ce , that it may be upon the Mit@@ re ; upon the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the Mit@@ re it shall be .
and for Aaron 's sons th@@ ou s@@ halt make co@@ ats , and th@@ ou s@@ halt make for them gir@@ d@@ les , and bon@@ n@@ ets s@@ halt th@@ ou make for them , for gl@@ ory and for beauty .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them upon Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons with him ; and s@@ halt ano@@ int them , and consec@@ rate them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy them , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the gar@@ ments , and put upon Aaron the co@@ at , and the ro@@ be of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and gir@@ d him with the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause a bul@@ lock to be brought before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bul@@ lock .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take all the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the ca@@ ul that is above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , and bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and s@@ halt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt receive them of their hands , and bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and if ought of the f@@ les@@ h of the consec@@ r@@ ations , or of the bread , remain un@@ to the morning , then th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n the remain@@ der with fire : it shall not be e@@ aten , because it is hol@@ y .
and I will sanc@@ ti@@ fy the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the alt@@ ar : I will sanc@@ ti@@ fy also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may d@@ well among them : I am the Lord their God .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay it with p@@ ure gold , the top there@@ of , and the sides there@@ of round about , and the hor@@ ns there@@ of ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it before the v@@ ail that is by the Ar@@ k of the testimony , before the mer@@ cy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with the@@ e .
this they shall give , every one that pass@@ eth among them that are num@@ ber@@ ed , half a sh@@ ek@@ el after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : ( a sh@@ ek@@ el is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s : ) an half sh@@ ek@@ el shall be the offering of the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a sh@@ ek@@ el , when they give an offering un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s .
upon man 's f@@ les@@ h shall it not be p@@ oured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is hol@@ y , and it shall be hol@@ y un@@ to you .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , where I will meet with the@@ e : it shall be un@@ to you most hol@@ y .
and as for the perf@@ ume which th@@ ou s@@ halt make , ye shall not make to yo@@ ur@@ selves according to the composition there@@ of : it shall be un@@ to the@@ e hol@@ y for the Lord .
and the clo@@ ths of service , and the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office ,
Y@@ e shall keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath therefore ; for it is hol@@ y un@@ to you : every one that def@@ il@@ eth it shall su@@ rely be put to death : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth any work there@@ in , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and Aaron said un@@ to them , Bre@@ ak off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them un@@ to me .
and Mos@@ es bes@@ ought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why do@@ th TH@@ Y wr@@ ath wa@@ x hot against TH@@ Y people , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ?
and Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that sh@@ out for mas@@ tery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the no@@ ise of them that sing do I hear .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it in the fire , and ground it to pow@@ der , and stra@@ wed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said un@@ to me , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
then Mos@@ es stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Wh@@ o is on the Lord 's side ? let him come un@@ to me . and all the sons of L@@ evi gathered themselves together un@@ to him .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Y@@ e have sin@@ ned a great sin : and now I will go up un@@ to the Lord ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for your sin .
yet now , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t for@@ give their sin@@ -- ; and if not , blo@@ t me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of TH@@ Y book which th@@ ou h@@ ast written .
therefore now go , lead the people un@@ to the place of which I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : be@@ hold , mine Angel shall go before the@@ e : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es went out un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Mos@@ es , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Mos@@ es entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar des@@ cen@@ ded , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the Lord talked with Mos@@ es .
and all the people saw the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar stand at the tab@@ ern@@ acle door : and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ pped , every man in his tent door .
observe th@@ ou that which I command the@@ e this day : be@@ hold , I drive out before the@@ e the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self , lest th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e :
and th@@ ou take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to TH@@ Y sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and make TH@@ Y sons go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds .
for I will cast out the nations before the@@ e , and en@@ large TH@@ Y borders : neither shall any man desire TH@@ Y land , when th@@ ou s@@ halt go up to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God th@@ ri@@ ce in the year .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come n@@ igh him .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Mos@@ es , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the v@@ ail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Mos@@ es gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel together , and said un@@ to them , These are the words which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , that ye should do them .
and the incen@@ se alt@@ ar , and his st@@ aves , and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and the swe@@ et incen@@ se , and the han@@ ging for the door at the entering in of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
the clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the hol@@ y place , the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office .
and all the women that were wise hear@@ ted did sp@@ in with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , both of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine lin@@ en .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering un@@ to the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had comman@@ ded to be made by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling : likewise he made in the ut@@ ter@@ most side of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in one cur@@ tain , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in the edge of the cur@@ tain which was in the cou@@ pling of the second : the lo@@ ops held one cur@@ tain to another .
and he over@@ laid the boards with gold , and made their r@@ ings of gold to be places for the bars , and over@@ laid the bars with gold .
one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the end on this side , and another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the other end on that side : out of the mer@@ cy seat made he the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the two ends there@@ of .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread out their w@@ ings on high , and covered with their w@@ ings over the mer@@ cy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mer@@ cy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dis@@ hes , and his sp@@ o@@ ons , and his bo@@ w@@ ls , and his covers to cover with@@ al , of p@@ ure gold .
and he made the cand@@ le@@ stick of p@@ ure gold : of beaten work made he the cand@@ le@@ stick ; his S@@ haf@@ t , and his branch , his bo@@ w@@ ls , his k@@ n@@ ops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides there@@ of ; three branches of the cand@@ le@@ stick out of the one side there@@ of , and three branches of the cand@@ le@@ stick out of the other side there@@ of :
and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold , both the top of it , and the sides there@@ of round about , and the hor@@ ns of it : also he made un@@ to it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and he made two r@@ ings of gold for it under the cro@@ wn there@@ of , by the two cor@@ ners of it , upon the two sides there@@ of , to be places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
and he made the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length there@@ of , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of ; it was fo@@ ur@@ square ; and three cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of .
and he made the hor@@ ns there@@ of on the four cor@@ ners of it ; the hor@@ ns there@@ of were of the same : and he over@@ laid it with br@@ ass .
and he made all the vessels of the alt@@ ar , the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons , and the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ oks , and the fi@@ rep@@ ans : all the vessels there@@ of made he of br@@ ass .
and he made the lav@@ er of br@@ ass , and the fo@@ ot of it of br@@ ass , of the lo@@ ok@@ ing@@ gl@@ ass@@ es of the women assemb@@ ling , which assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the so@@ c@@ kets for the pil@@ lars were of br@@ ass ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets of silver ; and the over@@ lay@@ ing of their chap@@ it@@ ers of silver ; and all the pil@@ lars of the court were fil@@ le@@ ted with silver .
and with him was Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan , an en@@ gra@@ ver , and a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man , and an em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ er in blue , and in pur@@ ple , and in scar@@ let , and fine lin@@ en .
and the silver of them that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the Con@@ gre@@ gation was an hundred tal@@ ents , and a thousand seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and they did beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , and in the pur@@ ple , and in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , with c@@ un@@ ning work .
and he put them on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the ep@@ ho@@ d , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , every one with his name , according to the twelve tri@@ bes .
and they made two r@@ ings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d in@@ ward .
and they made two other golden r@@ ings , and put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part of it , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and there was an hol@@ e in the mid@@ st of the ro@@ be , as the hol@@ e of an haber@@ ge@@ on , with a band round about the hol@@ e , that it should not ren@@ d .
and they made the pla@@ te of the hol@@ y cro@@ wn of p@@ ure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS TO the Lord .
and Mos@@ es did look upon all the work , and , be@@ hold , they have done it as the Lord had comman@@ ded , even so had they done it : and Mos@@ es b@@ les@@ sed them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the cand@@ le@@ stick , and light the lam@@ ps there@@ of .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and ano@@ int the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and all that is there@@ in , and s@@ halt hal@@ low it , and all the vessels there@@ of : and it shall be hol@@ y .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ano@@ int them , as th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ano@@ int their father , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office : for their ano@@ in@@ ting shall su@@ rely be an ever@@ lasting pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od throughout their generations .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up .
and Mos@@ es re@@ ar@@ ed up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and fas@@ tened his so@@ c@@ kets , and set up the boards there@@ of , and put in the bars there@@ of , and re@@ ar@@ ed up his pil@@ lars .
and he brought the Ar@@ k into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and set up the v@@ ail of the covering , and covered the Ar@@ k of the testimony ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up the court round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the alt@@ ar , and set up the han@@ ging of the court gate . so Mos@@ es finished the work .
for the cl@@ oud of the Lord was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their jour@@ neys .
if his offering be a bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice of the her@@ d , let him offer a male without ble@@ mis@@ h : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the Lord .
and he shall kill the bul@@ lock before the Lord : and the pri@@ ests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood round about upon the alt@@ ar that is by the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the pri@@ ests , Aaron 's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the f@@ at , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the alt@@ ar :
and he shall kill it on the side of the alt@@ ar nor@@ th@@ ward before the Lord : and the pri@@ ests , Aaron 's sons , shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le his blood round about upon the alt@@ ar .
and the pri@@ est shall bring it un@@ to the alt@@ ar , and wr@@ ing off his head , and bur@@ n it on the alt@@ ar ; and the blood there@@ of shall be wr@@ ung out at the side of the alt@@ ar :
and he shall p@@ lu@@ ck away his cro@@ p with his fe@@ ath@@ ers , and cast it bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and the re@@ mn@@ ant of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most hol@@ y of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the meat offering that is made of these things un@@ to the Lord : and when it is presented un@@ to the pri@@ est , he shall bring it un@@ to the alt@@ ar .
and the pri@@ est shall take from the meat offering a memorial there@@ of , and shall bur@@ n it upon the alt@@ ar : it is an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most hol@@ y of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire .
and every ob@@ lation of TH@@ Y meat offering s@@ halt th@@ ou season with salt ; neither s@@ halt th@@ ou suffer the salt of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of TH@@ Y God to be lacking from TH@@ Y meat offering : with all th@@ ine offer@@ ings th@@ ou s@@ halt offer salt .
and the pri@@ est shall bur@@ n the memorial of it , part of the beaten cor@@ n there@@ of , and part of the oil there@@ of , with all the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se there@@ of : it is an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and Aaron 's sons the pri@@ ests shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood upon the alt@@ ar round about .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord ; the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and all the f@@ at that is upon the in@@ wards ,
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is on them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away .
and Aaron 's sons shall bur@@ n it on the alt@@ ar upon the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and Aaron 's sons shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood there@@ of round about upon the alt@@ ar .
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and the sons of Aaron shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood there@@ of upon the alt@@ ar round about .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a sou@@ l shall sin through ignor@@ ance against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the pri@@ est that is ano@@ in@@ ted do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h un@@ to the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bul@@ lock un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bul@@ lock 's head , and kill the bul@@ lock before the Lord .
and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , which is by the f@@ lan@@ ks , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , with the kid@@ neys , it shall he take away ,
when the sin , which they have sin@@ ned against it , is known , then the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer a young bul@@ lock for the sin , and bring him before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and he shall do with the bul@@ lock as he did with the bul@@ lock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for them , and it shall be for@@ given them .
or if his sin , where@@ in he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a k@@ id of the go@@ ats , a male without ble@@ mis@@ h :
and he shall bur@@ n all his f@@ at upon the alt@@ ar , as the f@@ at of the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be for@@ given him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignor@@ ance , while he do@@ eth somewhat against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a k@@ id of the go@@ ats , a female without ble@@ mis@@ h , for his sin which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned .
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood there@@ of with his fin@@ ger , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , and shall p@@ our out all the blood there@@ of at the bottom of the alt@@ ar .
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his fin@@ ger , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , and shall p@@ our out all the blood there@@ of at the bottom of the alt@@ ar :
and if a sou@@ l sin , and hear the voice of swe@@ aring , and is a witness , whether he hat@@ h seen or known of it ; if he do not ut@@ ter it , then he shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and he shall bring them un@@ to the pri@@ est , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wr@@ ing off his head from his nec@@ k , but shall not divide it as@@ under :
and if a sou@@ l sin , and commit any of these things which are for@@ bid@@ den to be done by the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord ; though he w@@ ist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and he shall bring his t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord , a ram without ble@@ mis@@ h out of the flock , with TH@@ Y esti@@ mation , for a t@@ res@@ pass offering , un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and he shall put off his gar@@ ments , and put on other gar@@ ments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp un@@ to a clean place .
and the remain@@ der there@@ of shall Aaron and his sons eat : with un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall it be e@@ aten in the hol@@ y place ; in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation they shall eat it .
the pri@@ est that offer@@ eth it for sin shall eat it : in the hol@@ y place shall it be e@@ aten , in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall touch the f@@ les@@ h there@@ of shall be hol@@ y : and when there is sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led of the blood there@@ of upon any gar@@ ment , th@@ ou s@@ halt was@@ h that where@@ on it was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led in the hol@@ y place .
and no sin offering , where@@ of any of the blood is brought into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation to reconc@@ ile with@@ al in the hol@@ y place , shall be e@@ aten : it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .
and the pri@@ est that offer@@ eth any man 's bur@@ n@@ t offering , even the pri@@ est shall have to himself the s@@ kin of the bur@@ n@@ t offering which he hat@@ h offered .
and all the meat offering that is bak@@ en in the ov@@ en , and all that is d@@ ressed in the f@@ ry@@ ing@@ pan , and in the pan , shall be the pri@@ est 's that offer@@ eth it .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord , and it shall be the pri@@ est 's that sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le@@ th the blood of the peace offer@@ ings .
and the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice of his peace offer@@ ings for Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving shall be e@@ aten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
his own hands shall bring the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , the f@@ at with the bre@@ ast , it shall he bring , that the bre@@ ast may be w@@ av@@ ed for a wave offering before the Lord .
and he took all the f@@ at that was upon the in@@ wards , and ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and their f@@ at , and Mos@@ es burned it upon the alt@@ ar .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation in seven days , until the days of your consec@@ ration be at an end : for seven days shall he consec@@ rate you .
and the f@@ at of the bul@@ lock and of the ram , the rum@@ p , and that which cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver :
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the C@@ ame@@ l , because he che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ de@@ th not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you :
of all meat which may be e@@ aten , that on which such water co@@ me@@ th shall be un@@ clean : and all drink that may be dr@@ un@@ k in every such ves@@ sel shall be un@@ clean .
and he that e@@ ate@@ th of the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : he also that be@@ aret@@ h the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon the bel@@ ly , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon all four , or wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h more feet among all cre@@ eping things that cre@@ ep upon the ear@@ th , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hat@@ h born a male or a female .
but if the sc@@ a@@ b spread much abroad in the s@@ kin , after that he hat@@ h been seen of the pri@@ est for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the pri@@ est again :
and the pri@@ est shall see him : and , be@@ hold , if the rising be white in the s@@ kin , and it have turned the ha@@ ir white , and there be quick raw f@@ les@@ h in the rising ;
and in the seventh day the pri@@ est shall look on the pla@@ gue : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all spread not , and there be in it no yel@@ low ha@@ ir , and the sc@@ all be not in sight deeper than the s@@ kin ;
and he that hat@@ h his ha@@ ir fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is fore@@ head bal@@ d : yet is he clean .
he shall therefore bur@@ n that gar@@ ment , whether war@@ p or wo@@ of , in wo@@ ol@@ len or in lin@@ en , or any thing of s@@ kin , where@@ in the pla@@ gue is : for it is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy ; it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .
and if it appear still in the gar@@ ment , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of s@@ kin ; it is a spreading pla@@ gue : th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n that where@@ in the pla@@ gue is with fire .
and the pri@@ est shall go forth out of the camp ; and the pri@@ est shall look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy be he@@ aled in the le@@ per ;
and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le upon him that is to be cleans@@ ed from the le@@ pro@@ sy seven times , and shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and the pri@@ est that mak@@ eth him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and the pri@@ est shall dip his right fin@@ ger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the oil with his fin@@ ger seven times before the Lord :
and the re@@ mn@@ ant of the oil that is in the pri@@ est 's hand he shall p@@ our upon the head of him that is to be cleans@@ ed : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord .
and the pri@@ est shall offer the sin offering , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for him that is to be cleans@@ ed from his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess ; and after@@ ward he shall kill the bur@@ n@@ t offering :
and the pri@@ est shall offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the meat offering upon the alt@@ ar : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him , and he shall be clean .
and the rest of the oil that is in the pri@@ est 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord .
when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and the pri@@ est shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be spread in the walls of the house ;
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mor@@ ter , and shall pla@@ ister the house .
and if the pla@@ gue come again , and break out in the house , after that he hat@@ h taken away the stones , and after he hat@@ h sc@@ ra@@ ped the house , and after it is pla@@ ist@@ ered ;
then the pri@@ est shall come and look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be spread in the house , it is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy in the house : it is un@@ clean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , and all the mor@@ ter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an un@@ clean place .
and this shall be his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in his issue : whether his f@@ les@@ h run with his issue , or his f@@ les@@ h be stopped from his issue , it is his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
and wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever he tou@@ ch@@ eth that hat@@ h the issue , and hat@@ h not rin@@ sed his hands in water , he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , and come before the Lord un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and give them un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and the pri@@ est shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering ; and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord for his issue .
every bed where@@ on she li@@ eth all the days of her issue shall be un@@ to her as the bed of her separation : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she sit@@ te@@ th upon shall be un@@ clean , as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of her separation .
but the go@@ at , on which the lot fell to be the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement with him , and to let him go for a s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Aaron shall bring the bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bul@@ lock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a cen@@ ser full of burning co@@ als of fire from off the alt@@ ar before the Lord , and his hands full of swe@@ et incen@@ se beaten small , and bring it within the v@@ ail :
and he shall take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it with his fin@@ ger upon the mer@@ cy seat eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and before the mer@@ cy seat shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood with his fin@@ ger seven times .
and Aaron shall come into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall put off the lin@@ en gar@@ ments , which he put on when he went into the hol@@ y place , and shall leave them there :
speak un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to his sons , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them ; This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying ,
what man so@@ ever there be of the house of Israel , that kil@@ le@@ th an o@@ x , or lam@@ b , or go@@ at , in the camp , or that kil@@ le@@ th it out of the camp ,
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer it un@@ to the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
therefore every one that e@@ ate@@ th it shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because he hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ low@@ ed thing of the Lord : and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not wh@@ ol@@ ly re@@ ap the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est .

just balan@@ ces , just we@@ ights , a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death : they have w@@ rought conf@@ usion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with man@@ kind , as he li@@ eth with a woman , both of them have committed an ab@@ omin@@ ation : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and for his sister a vir@@ gin , that is n@@ igh un@@ to him , which hat@@ h had no husband ; for her may he be def@@ iled .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is hol@@ y un@@ to his God .
neither shall he go out of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , nor prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of his God ; for the cro@@ wn of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man he be that hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , he shall not approach : a b@@ lin@@ d man , or a la@@ me , or he that hat@@ h a flat n@@ ose , or any thing super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous ,
the sou@@ l which hat@@ h touched any such shall be un@@ clean until even , and shall not eat of the hol@@ y things , unless he was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h with water .
but if the pri@@ est buy any sou@@ l with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
and if a man eat of the hol@@ y thing un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , then he shall put the fifth part there@@ of un@@ to it , and shall give it un@@ to the pri@@ est with the hol@@ y thing .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of At@@ on@@ ement , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you before the Lord your God .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that shall not be aff@@ lic@@ ted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and the son of an Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman and a man of Israel stro@@ ve together in the camp ;
that which grow@@ eth of its own accord of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap , neither gather the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine und@@ ressed : for it is a year of rest un@@ to the land .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the tr@@ ump@@ et of the j@@ ub@@ ile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of At@@ on@@ ement shall ye make the tr@@ ump@@ et sound throughout all your land .
and ye shall so@@ w the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fru@@ its come in ye shall eat of the old store .
if TH@@ Y brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and hat@@ h sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to re@@ de@@ em it , then shall he re@@ de@@ em that which his brother sold .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and to be your God .
and then shall he de@@ part from the@@ e , both he and his children with him , and shall return un@@ to his own family , and un@@ to the possession of his fa@@ thers shall he return .
both TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ men , and TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , shall be of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bon@@ d@@ men and bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids .
and if there remain but few years un@@ to the year of j@@ ub@@ ile , then he shall count with him , and according un@@ to his years shall he give him again the price of his re@@ dem@@ ption .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid ev@@ il be@@ asts out of the land , neither shall the s@@ word go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bon@@ d@@ men ; and I have broken the bands of your yok@@ e , and made you go u@@ pri@@ ght .
and if ye shall desp@@ ise my stat@@ utes , or if your sou@@ l ab@@ h@@ or my judg@@ ments , so that ye will not do all my comman@@ d@@ ments , but that ye break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and your strength shall be spent in v@@ ain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fru@@ its .
I will also send wild be@@ asts among you , which shall ro@@ b you of your children , and destroy your c@@ attle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be de@@ so@@ late .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bak@@ e your bread in one ov@@ en , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a s@@ word , when none pursu@@ eth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enem@@ ies .
and they that are left of you shall p@@ ine away in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in your enem@@ ies ' lands ; and also in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fa@@ thers shall they p@@ ine away with them .
and that I also have walked contrary un@@ to them , and have brought them into the land of their enem@@ ies ; if then their un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised hear@@ ts be hum@@ b@@ led , and they then accept of the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity :
then will I remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Jac@@ o@@ b , and also my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with I@@ sa@@ ac , and also my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Ab@@ ra@@ ham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
and TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be of the male from twenty years old even un@@ to six@@ ty years old , even TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .

and if it be any un@@ clean be@@ ast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice un@@ to the Lord , then he shall present the be@@ ast before the pri@@ est :
and if he will not re@@ de@@ em the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be re@@ deemed any more .
in the year of the j@@ ub@@ ile the field shall return un@@ to him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , even of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , were for@@ ty and five thousand six hundred and fif@@ ty .

so were all those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the children of Israel , by the house of their fa@@ thers , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
but the L@@ evi@@ tes shall pit@@ ch round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , that there be no wr@@ ath upon the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony .
and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Ju@@ da@@ h pit@@ ch throughout their armies : and N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b shall be captain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h .

all that were num@@ ber@@ ed in the camp of Ju@@ da@@ h were an hundred thousand and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
and his host , and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were for@@ ty and five thousand and six hundred and fif@@ ty .
then the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall set forward with the camp of the L@@ evi@@ tes in the mid@@ st of the camp : as they en@@ camp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
all that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the camp of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred , throughout their armies . and they shall go forward in the third rank .
these are those which were num@@ ber@@ ed of the children of Israel by the house of their fa@@ thers : all those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fif@@ ty .

and they shall keep all the instruments of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel instead of all the fir@@ st@@ born that open@@ eth the mat@@ ri@@ x among the children of Israel : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be mine ;
those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , according to the number of all the mal@@ es , from a month old and up@@ ward , even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were seven thousand and five hundred .
and the charge of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall be the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the tent , the covering there@@ of , and the han@@ ging for the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ,

and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , according to the number of all the mal@@ es , from a month old and up@@ ward , were six thousand and two hundred .
and the chief of the house of the father of the families of Mer@@ ari was Z@@ ur@@ i@@ el the son of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il : these shall pit@@ ch on the side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle nor@@ th@@ ward .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born mal@@ es by the number of names , from a month old and up@@ ward , of those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and thir@@ teen .
and for those that are to be re@@ deemed of the two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and thir@@ teen of the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel , which are more than the L@@ evi@@ tes ;
of the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and when the camp set@@ te@@ th forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering v@@ ail , and cover the Ar@@ k of testimony with it :

from thirty years old and up@@ ward until fif@@ ty years old s@@ halt th@@ ou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their bur@@ den@@ s , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint un@@ to them in charge all their bur@@ den@@ s .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and their charge shall be under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .

even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall conf@@ ess their sin which they have done : and he shall re@@ compen@@ se his t@@ res@@ pass with the principal there@@ of , and add un@@ to it the fifth part there@@ of , and give it un@@ to him against whom he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed .
but if th@@ ou h@@ ast gone aside to another instead of TH@@ Y husband , and if th@@ ou be def@@ iled , and some man have la@@ in with the@@ e bes@@ ide th@@ ine husband :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se : and the water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the pri@@ est shall take the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the alt@@ ar :
and the pri@@ est shall take an hand@@ ful of the offering , even the memorial there@@ of , and bur@@ n it upon the alt@@ ar , and after@@ ward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and the pri@@ est shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate un@@ to the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lam@@ b of the first year for a t@@ res@@ pass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was def@@ iled .
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , with the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : the pri@@ est shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the pr@@ inces offered for dedic@@ ating of the alt@@ ar in the day that it was ano@@ in@@ ted , even the pr@@ inces offered their offering before the alt@@ ar .
and this work of the cand@@ le@@ stick was of beaten gold , un@@ to the S@@ haf@@ t there@@ of , un@@ to the flowers there@@ of , was beaten work : according un@@ to the pat@@ tern which the Lord had she@@ wed Mos@@ es , so he made the cand@@ le@@ stick .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given un@@ to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every w@@ om@@ b , even instead of the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , have I taken them un@@ to me .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and there were certain men , who were def@@ iled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pass@@ over on that day : and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said un@@ to him , We are def@@ iled by the dead body of a man : where@@ fore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
and on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , name@@ ly , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cl@@ oud abo@@ de , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their ten@@ ts .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they pit@@ ched : as long as the cl@@ oud abo@@ de upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle they rested in their ten@@ ts .
and so it was , when the cl@@ oud was a few days upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they rested in the ten@@ ts , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
make the@@ e two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver ; of a whole piece s@@ halt th@@ ou make them : that th@@ ou may@@ est use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
and it came to pass on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their armies : and over his host was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou go with us , ye@@ a , it shall be , that what Go@@ od@@ ness the Lord shall do un@@ to us , the same will we do un@@ to the@@ e .
and they depar@@ ted from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and if th@@ ou deal thus with me , kill me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of hand , if I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight ; and let me not see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess .
and while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , ER@@ E it was che@@ wed , the wr@@ ath of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and the Lord smo@@ te the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
( now the man Mos@@ es was very me@@ ek , above all the men which were upon the face of the ear@@ th . )
and the Lord came down in the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even apparently , and not in dark spe@@ eches ; and the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of the Lord shall he be@@ hold : where@@ fore then were ye not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant Mos@@ es ?
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they d@@ well in , whether in ten@@ ts , or in strong holds ;
and they as@@ cen@@ ded by the south , and came un@@ to He@@ br@@ on ; where Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
and they came un@@ to the Bro@@ ok of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from th@@ ence a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ are it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and of the fig@@ s .
and all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said un@@ to them , Wo@@ uld God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
your car@@ cases shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and all that were num@@ ber@@ ed of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , which have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
doub@@ t@@ less ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sw@@ are to make you d@@ well there@@ in , save Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even for@@ ty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , even for@@ ty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord .
Y@@ e shall offer up a c@@ ake of the first of your d@@ ough for an he@@ ave offering : as ye do the he@@ ave offering of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , so shall ye he@@ ave it .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h ignor@@ antly , when he sin@@ net@@ h by ignor@@ ance before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him ; and it shall be for@@ given him .
Y@@ e shall have one law for him that sin@@ net@@ h through ignor@@ ance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them .
but the sou@@ l that do@@ eth ought pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a st@@ ran@@ ger , the same re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
is it a small thing that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , except th@@ ou make th@@ y@@ self altogether a pr@@ ince over us ?
and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained un@@ to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
and Aaron took as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded , and ran into the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ; and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue was begun among the people : and he put on incen@@ se , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the people .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's ro@@ d , whom I shall choose , shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , where@@ by they mur@@ mur against you .
and they shall keep TH@@ Y charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come n@@ igh the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the alt@@ ar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken your bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and , be@@ hold , I have given the children of L@@ evi all the tenth in Israel for an inher@@ it@@ ance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and this your he@@ ave offering shall be rec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to you , as though it were the cor@@ n of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the ful@@ ness of the win@@ e@@ press .
then the pri@@ est shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and he shall ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp , and the pri@@ est shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they fell upon their faces : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to them .
Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given un@@ to the children of Israel , because ye rebel@@ led against my word at the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah .
and when king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the sp@@ ies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from mount H@@ or by the way of the Red sea , to comp@@ ass the land of E@@ dom : and the sou@@ l of the people was much dis@@ cour@@ aged because of the way .
from th@@ ence they removed , and pit@@ ched on the other side of Ar@@ non , which is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that co@@ me@@ th out of the co@@ asts of the Am@@ ori@@ tes : for Ar@@ non is the border of Mo@@ a@@ b , between Mo@@ a@@ b and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
for H@@ es@@ h@@ bon was the city of S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and taken all his land out of his hand , even un@@ to Ar@@ non .
for there is a fire gone out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , a fla@@ me from the city of S@@ ih@@ on : it hat@@ h consu@@ med A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the lor@@ ds of the high places of Ar@@ non .
and they turned and went up by the way of B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
and God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went : and the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she th@@ rust her@@ self un@@ to the wall , and cr@@ us@@ hed Bal@@ a@@ am 's fo@@ ot against the wall : and he smo@@ te her again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she fell down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led , and he smo@@ te the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and he bo@@ wed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am was come , he went out to meet him un@@ to a city of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is in the border of Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most coast .
be@@ hold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the pre@@ y , and drink the blood of the sla@@ in .
he shall p@@ our the water out of his bu@@ c@@ kets , and his se@@ ed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than A@@ ga@@ g , and his k@@ ing@@ dom shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hat@@ h as it were the strength of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n : he shall eat up the nations his enem@@ ies , and shall break their b@@ ones , and Pi@@ erce them through with his ar@@ ro@@ ws .
and Bal@@ ak 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he smo@@ te his hands together : and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , I called the@@ e to cur@@ se mine enem@@ ies , and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast altogether b@@ les@@ sed them these three times .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ azar , the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , saw it , he rose up from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and took a j@@ av@@ elin in his hand ;
now the name of the Isra@@ elite that was sla@@ in , even that was sla@@ in with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman , was Z@@ im@@ ri , the son of Sal@@ u , a pr@@ ince of a chief house among the Sime@@ on@@ ites .
and the name of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman that was sla@@ in was Co@@ z@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Mi@@ dian .
and the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h after their families were ; of She@@ lah , the family of the S@@ hel@@ an@@ ites : of P@@ har@@ ez , the family of the P@@ har@@ zi@@ tes : of Zer@@ ah , the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes .
of the sons of Ze@@ bul@@ un after their families : of Ser@@ ed , the family of the Sar@@ di@@ tes : of El@@ on , the family of the E@@ lon@@ ites : of Jah@@ le@@ el , the family of the Jah@@ le@@ eli@@ tes .
these are the families of the sons of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
all the families of the Sh@@ u@@ ham@@ ites , according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were thre@@ es@@ core and four thousand and four hundred .
these are the families of the sons of As@@ her according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them ; who were fif@@ ty and three thousand and four hundred .
to many th@@ ou s@@ halt give the more inher@@ it@@ ance , and to few th@@ ou s@@ halt give the less inher@@ it@@ ance : to every one shall his inher@@ it@@ ance be given according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of him .
these are the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes : the family of the Lib@@ ni@@ tes , the family of the He@@ bron@@ ites , the family of the Mah@@ li@@ tes , the family of the Mus@@ hi@@ tes , the family of the Kor@@ ath@@ ites . and Ko@@ hat@@ h beg@@ at Am@@ ram .
and the name of Am@@ ram 's wife was Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed , the daughter of L@@ evi , whom her mother b@@ are to L@@ evi in Egypt : and she b@@ are un@@ to Am@@ ram Aaron and Mos@@ es , and Mi@@ ri@@ am their sister .
our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had speak right : th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely give them a possession of an inher@@ it@@ ance among their father 's bre@@ th@@ ren ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause the inher@@ it@@ ance of their father to pass un@@ to them .
for ye rebel@@ led against my comman@@ d@@ ment in the de@@ sert of Z@@ in , in the stri@@ fe of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah in K@@ ade@@ sh in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in .
and the drink offering there@@ of shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lam@@ b : in the hol@@ y place s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the strong wine to be p@@ oured un@@ to the Lord for a drink offering .
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its , when ye bring a new meat offering un@@ to the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :

and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
and Mos@@ es sent them to the war , a thousand of every tri@@ be , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the hol@@ y instruments , and the tr@@ ump@@ ets to blow in his hand .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the sp@@ oil of all their c@@ attle , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods .
and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with the officers of the host , with the cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of be@@ ast , th@@ ou , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the chief fa@@ thers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and the bo@@ o@@ ty , being the rest of the pre@@ y which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and sev@@ enty thousand and five thousand she@@ ep ,
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred she@@ ep :
( now the half that per@@ tained un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred she@@ ep ,
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near un@@ to Mos@@ es :
and they said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ y servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there la@@ c@@ ket@@ h not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , that had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , was consu@@ med .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them un@@ to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the f@@ enced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land be sub@@ du@@ ed before the Lord : then after@@ ward ye shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and they depar@@ ted from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and they depar@@ ted from before P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the mid@@ st of the sea into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and went three days ' journey in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Eth@@ am , and pit@@ ched in Mar@@ ah .
and they removed from Mar@@ ah , and came un@@ to E@@ lim : and in E@@ lim were twelve fo@@ un@@ tains of water , and thre@@ es@@ core and ten pal@@ m trees ; and they pit@@ ched there .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and quite p@@ lu@@ ck down all their high places :
from mount H@@ or ye shall point out your border un@@ to the entrance of Ham@@ ath ; and the go@@ ings forth of the border shall be to Z@@ ed@@ ad :
and the coast shall go down from S@@ hep@@ ham to R@@ ib@@ lah , on the east side of A@@ in ; and the border shall des@@ cen@@ d , and shall reach un@@ to the side of the sea of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard :
command the children of Israel , that they give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes of the inher@@ it@@ ance of their possession cities to d@@ well in ; and ye shall give also un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes subur@@ bs for the cities round about them .
and the subur@@ bs of the cities , which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall reach from the wall of the city and ou@@ tw@@ ard a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes there shall be six cities for ref@@ uge , which ye shall appoint for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , that he may flee th@@ ither : and to them ye shall add for@@ ty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be for@@ ty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their subur@@ bs .
Y@@ e shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which shall be cities of ref@@ uge .
because he should have remained in the city of his ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the S@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
W@@ hos@@ o kil@@ le@@ th any person , the mur@@ der@@ er shall be put to death by the m@@ outh of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his ref@@ uge , that he should come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it def@@ il@@ eth the land : and the land can@@ not be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed there@@ in , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The Lord comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for an inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by the Lord to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother un@@ to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
this is the thing which the Lord do@@ th command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them mar@@ ry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they mar@@ ry .
so shall not the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Israel remove from tri@@ be to tri@@ be : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of his fa@@ thers .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down un@@ to us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God do@@ th give us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to she@@ w you by what way ye should go , and in a cl@@ oud by day .
and command th@@ ou the people , saying , Y@@ e are to pass through the coast of your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore :
Y@@ e shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and the Av@@ ims which d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ er@@ im , even un@@ to Az@@ z@@ ah , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ ims , which came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead . )
only un@@ to the land of the children of Am@@ mon th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st not , nor un@@ to any place of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , nor un@@ to the cities in the mountains , nor un@@ to wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God for@@ bad us .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon ;
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , being the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , with all B@@ ash@@ an , which was called the land of gi@@ ants .
and un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and un@@ to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even un@@ to the river Ar@@ non half the val@@ ley , and the border even un@@ to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
O Lord God , th@@ ou h@@ ast begun to she@@ w TH@@ Y ser@@ vant TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand : for what God is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to TH@@ Y works , and according to TH@@ Y might ?
Y@@ e shall not add un@@ to the word which I command you , neither shall ye dimin@@ ish ought from it , that ye may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God which I command you .
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and sw@@ are that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in un@@ to that good land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
but if from th@@ ence th@@ ou s@@ halt seek the Lord TH@@ Y God , th@@ ou s@@ halt find him , if th@@ ou seek him with all TH@@ Y heart and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
when th@@ ou art in tri@@ bu@@ lation , and all these things are come upon the@@ e , even in the latter days , if th@@ ou turn to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his voice ;
and because he lov@@ ed TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought the@@ e out in his sight with his m@@ igh@@ ty power out of Egypt ;
that the S@@ lay@@ er might flee th@@ ither , which should kill his neighbour un@@ awar@@ es , and ha@@ ted him not in times past ; and that fle@@ eing un@@ to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to she@@ w you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the waters ben@@ e@@ ath the ear@@ th :
go th@@ ou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak th@@ ou un@@ to us all that the Lord our God shall speak un@@ to the@@ e ; and we will hear it , and do it .
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a Je@@ al@@ ous God among you ) lest the an@@ ger of the Lord TH@@ Y God be kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and destroy the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est go in and poss@@ ess the good land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ,
and the Lord will take away from the@@ e all si@@ ck@@ ness , and will put none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou know@@ est , upon the@@ e ; but will lay them upon all them that h@@ ate the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt consum@@ e all the people which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver the@@ e ; th@@ ine eye shall have no p@@ ity upon them : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are un@@ to the@@ e .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will put out those nations before the@@ e by little and little : th@@ ou may@@ est not consum@@ e them at once , lest the be@@ asts of the field increase upon the@@ e .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt destroy their name from under heav@@ en : there shall no man be able to stand before the@@ e , until th@@ ou have destroyed them .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember the Lord TH@@ Y God : for it is he that gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e power to get wealth , that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , as it is this day .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his stead .
and his mir@@ ac@@ les , and his acts , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and un@@ to all his land ;
and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers to give un@@ to them and to their se@@ ed , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
a land which the Lord TH@@ Y God c@@ aret@@ h for : the eyes of the Lord TH@@ Y God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even un@@ to the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that th@@ ou may@@ est gather in TH@@ Y cor@@ n , and TH@@ Y wine , and th@@ ine oil .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l , and bin@@ d them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as fron@@ t@@ lets between your eyes .
and ye shall te@@ ach them your children , speaking of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall tre@@ ad upon , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to you .
and a cur@@ se , if ye will not obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h brought the@@ e in un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it , that th@@ ou s@@ halt put the b@@ les@@ sing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se upon mount E@@ bal .
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , all the days that ye live upon the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , upon the high mountains , and upon the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that ye put your hand un@@ to , ye and your households , where@@ in the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e .
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of TH@@ Y tri@@ bes , there th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there th@@ ou s@@ halt do all that I command the@@ e .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , where@@ of he sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Let us go after other go@@ ds , which th@@ ou h@@ ast not known , and let us serve them ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hat@@ h sought to th@@ rust the@@ e away from the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought among you ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely sm@@ ite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in , and the c@@ attle there@@ of , with the edge of the s@@ word .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and the Lord hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people un@@ to himself , above all the nations that are upon the ear@@ th .
and every be@@ ast that par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and cle@@ av@@ eth the cle@@ ft into two cla@@ ws , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d among the be@@ asts , that ye shall eat .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in th@@ ine hand , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose :
for the poor shall never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to TH@@ Y brother , to TH@@ Y poor , and to TH@@ Y ne@@ edy , in TH@@ Y land .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of TH@@ Y flock , and out of TH@@ Y floor , and out of TH@@ Y win@@ e@@ press : of that where@@ with the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to him .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore sacrifice the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : and th@@ ou s@@ halt turn in the morning , and go un@@ to TH@@ Y ten@@ ts .
seven weeks s@@ halt th@@ ou number un@@ to the@@ e : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as th@@ ou begin@@ n@@ est to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the cor@@ n .
if there be found among you , within any of TH@@ Y gates which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , man or woman , that hat@@ h w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord TH@@ Y God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and it be told the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of it , and inqu@@ ired dil@@ ig@@ ently , and , be@@ hold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought in Israel :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come un@@ to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and un@@ to the judge that shall be in those days , and inqu@@ ire ; and they shall she@@ w the@@ e the sentence of judgment :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall she@@ w the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe to do according to all that they inform the@@ e :
and if a Lev@@ ite come from any of TH@@ Y gates out of all Israel , where he so@@ jour@@ ned , and come with all the desire of his mind un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose ;
for these nations , which th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess , hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to observers of times , and un@@ to di@@ vin@@ ers : but as for the@@ e , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h not suffered the@@ e so to do .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not he@@ arken un@@ to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but if any man h@@ ate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and sm@@ ite him mort@@ ally that he die , and fle@@ eth into one of these cities :
and what man is there that hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed a wife , and hat@@ h not taken her ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking un@@ to the people , that they shall make cap@@ tains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make the@@ e answer of peace , and open un@@ to the@@ e , then it shall be , that all the people that is found there@@ in shall be tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to the@@ e , and they shall serve the@@ e .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them ; name@@ ly , the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e :
and it shall be , that the city which is next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take an he@@ if@@ er , which hat@@ h not been w@@ rought with , and which hat@@ h not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
then it shall be , when he mak@@ eth his sons to inher@@ it that which he hat@@ h , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , which is indeed the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , which will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have ch@@ as@@ tened him , will not he@@ arken un@@ to them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , and un@@ to the gate of his place ;
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an ev@@ il name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a ma@@ id :
then shall the father of the dam@@ sel , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the dam@@ sel 's vir@@ gin@@ ity un@@ to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate :
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away ev@@ il from Israel .
but un@@ to the dam@@ sel th@@ ou s@@ halt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against the@@ e Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or of P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se the@@ e .
but it shall be , when evening co@@ me@@ th on , he shall was@@ h himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have a p@@ add@@ le upon TH@@ Y weapon ; and it shall be , when th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t ease th@@ y@@ self abroad , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g there@@ with , and s@@ halt turn back and cover that which co@@ me@@ th from the@@ e :
he shall d@@ well with the@@ e , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of TH@@ Y gates , where it lik@@ eth him best : th@@ ou s@@ halt not op@@ press him .
that which is gone out of TH@@ Y li@@ ps th@@ ou s@@ halt keep and perform ; even a fre@@ e@@ will offering , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised with TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into TH@@ Y neighbour 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then th@@ ou may@@ est eat grap@@ es TH@@ Y fill at th@@ ine own pleas@@ ure ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not put any in TH@@ Y ves@@ sel .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his bre@@ th@@ ren of the children of Israel , and mak@@ eth mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of him , or sel@@ le@@ th him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt put ev@@ il away from among you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that th@@ ou observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so ye shall observe to do .
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
when th@@ ou gather@@ est the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , th@@ ou s@@ halt not g@@ le@@ an it after@@ ward : it shall be for the st@@ ran@@ ger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
how he met the@@ e by the way , and smo@@ te the hin@@ d@@ most of the@@ e , even all that were fe@@ e@@ ble behind the@@ e , when th@@ ou w@@ ast fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he fear@@ ed not God .
and now , be@@ hold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of the land , which th@@ ou , O Lord , h@@ ast given me . and th@@ ou s@@ halt set it before the Lord TH@@ Y God , and worship before the Lord TH@@ Y God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in every good thing which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to th@@ ine house , th@@ ou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that is among you .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt set the@@ e up great stones , and pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister :
b@@ les@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y ground , and the fruit of TH@@ Y c@@ attle , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
and all people of the ear@@ th shall see that th@@ ou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of the@@ e .
the Lord will sm@@ ite the@@ e with the bot@@ ch of Egypt , and with the emer@@ ods , and with the sc@@ a@@ b , and with the it@@ ch , where@@ of th@@ ou can@@ st not be he@@ aled .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : th@@ ou s@@ halt build an house , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not d@@ well there@@ in : th@@ ou s@@ halt plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and s@@ halt not gather the grap@@ es there@@ of .
TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given un@@ to another people , and th@@ ine eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in th@@ ine hand .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bot@@ ch that can@@ not be he@@ aled , from the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot un@@ to the top of TH@@ Y head .
if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that th@@ ou may@@ est fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , the Lord TH@@ Y God ;
then the Lord will make TH@@ Y plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and sor@@ e si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
and among these nations s@@ halt th@@ ou find no ease , neither shall the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot have rest : but the Lord shall give the@@ e there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and sor@@ row of mind :
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , bes@@ ide the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
and Mos@@ es called un@@ to all Israel , and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all his servants , and un@@ to all his land ;
then men shall say , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
if any of th@@ ine be driven out un@@ to the out@@ most parts of heav@@ en , from th@@ ence will the Lord TH@@ Y God gather the@@ e , and from th@@ ence will he f@@ et@@ ch the@@ e :
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will circum@@ c@@ ise th@@ ine heart , and the heart of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , to love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , that th@@ ou may@@ est live .
I den@@ oun@@ ce un@@ to you this day , that ye shall su@@ rely per@@ ish , and that ye shall not prol@@ ong your days upon the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est over Jordan to go to poss@@ ess it .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord TH@@ Y God , he will go over before the@@ e , and he will destroy these nations from before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess them : and Jos@@ hua , he shall go over before the@@ e , as the Lord hat@@ h said .
and Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it un@@ to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and un@@ to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which he shall choose , th@@ ou s@@ halt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ ils which they shall have w@@ rought , in that they are turned un@@ to other go@@ ds .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , and oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
I will make mine ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood , and my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h ; and that with the blood of the sla@@ in and of the cap@@ tives , from the beginning of reven@@ ges upon the enemy .
and die in the mount w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est up , and be gathered un@@ to TH@@ Y people ; as Aaron TH@@ Y brother died in mount H@@ or , and was gathered un@@ to his people :
because ye t@@ res@@ passed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because ye sanc@@ ti@@ fied me not in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
they shall call the people un@@ to the mountain ; there they shall offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for they shall su@@ ck of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , and of treasures hi@@ d in the s@@ and .
and Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b un@@ to the mountain of N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . and the Lord she@@ wed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to Dan ,
now after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' minister , saying ,
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and this Lebanon even un@@ to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and un@@ to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
and it came to pass about the time of sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : w@@ hi@@ ther the men went I wo@@ t not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall over@@ take them .
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of of the house , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order upon the ro@@ of .
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , When ye see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the pri@@ ests , saying , T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and went before the people .
now all the people that came out were circum@@ c@@ ised : but all the people that were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circum@@ c@@ ised .
and it came to pass , when they had done circum@@ c@@ ising all the people , that they abo@@ de in their places in the camp , ti@@ ll they were whole .
and ye , in any wise keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the accur@@ sed thing , lest ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves accur@@ sed , when ye take of the accur@@ sed thing , and make the camp of Israel a cur@@ se , and trouble it .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was there@@ in : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron , they put into the treas@@ ury of the house of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Israel even un@@ to this day ; because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , which Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and they took them out of the mid@@ st of the tent , and brought them un@@ to Jos@@ hua , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up against A@@ I : and Jos@@ hua chose out thirty thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and sent them away by night .
( for they will come out after us ) ti@@ ll we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have comman@@ ded you .
and all the people that were in A@@ I were called together to pursue after them : and they pursu@@ ed after Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and has@@ ted and set the city on fire .
they did work w@@ il@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their ass@@ es , and wine bott@@ les , old , and rent , and bound up ;
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go un@@ to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and it is mo@@ ul@@ dy :
and these bott@@ les of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , be@@ hold , they be rent : and these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they d@@ wel@@ t among them .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing them with a very great sla@@ ughter , ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med , that the rest which remained of them entered into f@@ enced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings un@@ to him out of the cave , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the pla@@ ins south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , and in the val@@ ley , and in the borders of D@@ or on the west ,
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the s@@ and that is upon the sea shore in multi@@ tude , with hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots very many .
them did Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord gave it for a possession un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is upon the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba un@@ to Di@@ bon ;
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
and the border of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en was Jordan , and the border there@@ of . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en after their families , the cities and the villages there@@ of .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : and this was the possession of the half tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families .
for@@ ty years old was I when Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord sent me from K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea to es@@ p@@ y out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
this then was the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ la , and passed along by the north of Beth @@@ -@@ @ arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill un@@ to the fo@@ un@@ tain of the water of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border was drawn to Ba@@ al@@ ah , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im :
and the border comp@@ ass@@ ed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to mount Se@@ ir , and passed along un@@ to the side of mount J@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast there@@ of . this is the coast of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h round about according to their families .
and go@@ eth down w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the coast of Jap@@ h@@ le@@ ti , un@@ to the coast of Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and to Ge@@ zer : and the go@@ ings out there@@ of are at the sea .
and the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families was thus : even the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance on the east side was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , un@@ to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eas@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and passed by it on the east to Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h ;
the border went out from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im by their families .
sou@@ th@@ ward it was E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's , and nor@@ th@@ ward it was Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in As@@ her on the north , and in Is@@ sac@@ har on the east .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were wa@@ x@@ en strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute ; but did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , T@@ ho@@ u art a great people , and h@@ ast great power : th@@ ou s@@ halt not have one lot only :
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel assemb@@ led together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation there . and the land was sub@@ du@@ ed before them .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Ju@@ da@@ h shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
and the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , and des@@ cen@@ ded to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward : and the out@@ go@@ ings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
the children of Mer@@ ari by their families had out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi , had : for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the pri@@ est He@@ br@@ on with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Lib@@ n@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ,
and the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes which remained of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and un@@ to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with her subur@@ bs , and Kar@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs ,
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up to war against them .
and they came un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , un@@ to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they sp@@ ake with them , saying ,
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer there@@ on bur@@ n@@ t offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offer@@ ings there@@ on , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak un@@ to our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and the Lord your God , he shall exp@@ el them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall poss@@ ess their land , as the Lord your God hat@@ h promised un@@ to you .
be ye therefore very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that ye turn not aside there@@ from to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to them :
for the Lord hat@@ h driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hat@@ h been able to stand before you un@@ to this day .
and it came to pass after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
now the children of Ju@@ da@@ h had fought against Jer@@ usalem , and had taken it , and s@@ mit@@ ten it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
and when he she@@ wed them the entrance into the city , they smo@@ te the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the val@@ ley :
and it came to pass , when the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for ev@@ il , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn un@@ to them : and they were greatly dist@@ ressed .
and when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and E@@ h@@ ud came un@@ to him ; and he was sitting in a summer par@@ l@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and E@@ h@@ ud said , I have a message from God un@@ to the@@ e . and he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and they sle@@ w of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , all lu@@ st@@ y , and all men of val@@ our ; and there escaped not a man .
and Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les un@@ to the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted Sis@@ era , and all his char@@ i@@ ots , and all his host , with the edge of the s@@ word before B@@ arak ; so that Sis@@ era ligh@@ ted down off his char@@ i@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the host , un@@ to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the host of Sis@@ era fell upon the edge of the s@@ word ; and there was not a man left .
and the hand of the children of Israel prosp@@ ered , and prev@@ ailed against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after the@@ e , Benjamin , among TH@@ Y people ; out of Mac@@ hir came down govern@@ ors , and out of Ze@@ bul@@ un they that handle the p@@ en of the writer .
she put her hand to the na@@ il , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer ; and with the ham@@ mer she smo@@ te Sis@@ era , she smo@@ te off his head , when she had pi@@ er@@ ced and stric@@ ken through his temp@@ les .
and the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel : and because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and c@@ aves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all that op@@ pressed you , and dra@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which th@@ ou s@@ halt cut down .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt hear what they say ; and after@@ ward shall th@@ ine hands be strengthened to go down un@@ to the host . then went he down with P@@ hur@@ ah his ser@@ vant un@@ to the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and by the sea side for multi@@ tude .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
thus was Mi@@ dian sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and it came to pass , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a wh@@ oring after Ba@@ al@@ im , and made Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
and the children of Israel remember@@ ed not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enem@@ ies on every side :
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem un@@ to his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely , in that ye have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , and if ye have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done un@@ to him according to the de@@ serving of his hands ;
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and th@@ ither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and g@@ at them up to the top of the to@@ wer .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came un@@ to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and went hard un@@ to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hands of the children of Am@@ mon .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain men to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to f@@ et@@ ch J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b :
then the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon .
and she said un@@ to her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my fel@@ lows .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand , and called that place Ram@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ le@@ hi .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his sou@@ l was v@@ ex@@ ed un@@ to death ;
but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he did gr@@ ind in the prison house .
and when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destro@@ yer of our country , which sle@@ w many of us .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born un@@ to Israel : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jer@@ usalem ; and there were with him two ass@@ es s@@ add@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to his master , C@@ ome , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and let us turn in into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it .
and , be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot@@ men that drew s@@ word .
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
and the liers in wait has@@ ted , and rushed upon Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smo@@ te all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
but when the fla@@ me began to arise up out of the city with a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them , and , be@@ hold , the fla@@ me of the city as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel un@@ to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle over@@ took them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the mid@@ st of them .
and they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them un@@ to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the children of Israel depar@@ ted th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return un@@ to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and she went , and came , and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and her ha@@ p was to light on a part of the field belonging un@@ to Bo@@ az , who was of the kin@@ d@@ red of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it came to pass , when the time was come about after H@@ ann@@ ah had conce@@ ived , that she b@@ are a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Bec@@ ause I have asked him of the Lord .
now E@@ li was very old , and heard all that his sons did un@@ to all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of TH@@ Y father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and it came to pass at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wa@@ x dim , that he could not see ;
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the mor@@ row , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the ear@@ th before the Ar@@ k of the Lord . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
and they of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
and these are the golden emer@@ ods which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord ; for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for As@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
and the men of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , ce@@ ase not to cry un@@ to the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the Lord said un@@ to Samuel , Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of the people in all that they say un@@ to the@@ e : for they have not rejected the@@ e , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your ol@@ i@@ ve@@ yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of B@@ ech@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of power .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant that was with him , C@@ ome , and let us return ; lest my father leave car@@ ing for the ass@@ es , and take thought for us .
( Be@@ fore@@ time in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he sp@@ ake , C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er : for he that is now called a Pro@@ phe@@ t was be@@ fore@@ time called a Se@@ er . )
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and Samuel took Sa@@ ul and his ser@@ vant , and brought them into the par@@ l@@ our , and made them sit in the chi@@ ef@@ est place among them that were bid@@ den , which were about thirty persons .
when he had caused the tri@@ be of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Mat@@ ri was taken , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
when Jac@@ o@@ b was come into Egypt , and your fa@@ thers cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , then the Lord sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , which brought forth your fa@@ thers out of Egypt , and made them d@@ well in this place .
but if ye will not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might sal@@ ute him .
and the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned un@@ to the way that le@@ ade@@ th to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , un@@ to the land of Sh@@ ual :
and that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half ac@@ re of land , which a yok@@ e of ox@@ en might plo@@ w .
and Sa@@ ul and all the people that were with him assemb@@ led themselves , and they came to the battle : and , be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ f@@ it@@ ure .
moreover the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hi@@ d themselves in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
and the people fle@@ w upon the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am , the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az : and the name of the captain of his host was Ab@@ ner , the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
and he had an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head , and he was armed with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
and the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se went and followed Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next un@@ to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Sa@@ ul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the j@@ av@@ elin ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the j@@ av@@ elin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
but also th@@ ou s@@ halt not cut off TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hat@@ h cut off the enem@@ ies of David every one from the face of the ear@@ th .
and when th@@ ou h@@ ast stayed three days , then th@@ ou s@@ halt go down quickly , and come to the place where th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st hide th@@ y@@ self when the business was in hand , and s@@ halt remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little la@@ d with him .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g , an E@@ dom@@ ite , the chi@@ ef@@ est of the her@@ d@@ men that belonged to Sa@@ ul .
then came up the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , Do@@ th not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on ?
and it came to pass , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Sa@@ ul . but Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed this day how that th@@ ou h@@ ast dealt well with me : for@@ as@@ much as when the Lord had delivered me into th@@ ine hand , th@@ ou kil@@ led@@ st me not .
swe@@ ar now therefore un@@ to me by the Lord , that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
and now I have heard that th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ hear@@ ers : now TH@@ Y she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing un@@ to them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my f@@ les@@ h that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it un@@ to men , whom I know not wh@@ ence they be ?
and when A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il saw David , she has@@ ted , and ligh@@ ted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground ,
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il has@@ ted , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
and Sa@@ ul pit@@ ched in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before J@@ es@@ him@@ on , by the way . but David abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the ear@@ th before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one do@@ th hunt a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains .
and , be@@ hold , as TH@@ Y life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tri@@ bu@@ lation .
and David d@@ wel@@ t with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . and Sa@@ ul had put away those that had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , he@@ arken th@@ ou also un@@ to the voice of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before the@@ e ; and eat , that th@@ ou may@@ est have strength , when th@@ ou go@@ est on TH@@ Y way .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now rise up early in the morning with TH@@ Y master 's servants that are come with the@@ e : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part .
so David and his men came to the city , and , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
now it came to pass after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had abo@@ de two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until even , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( also he b@@ ade them te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the use of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ her . )
and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . and they told David , saying , That the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad were they that buried Sa@@ ul .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and said un@@ to them , b@@ les@@ sed be ye of the Lord , that ye have she@@ wed this kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to your lor@@ d , even un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : where@@ fore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong for the house of Sa@@ ul .
and Ab@@ ner also sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so David would not remove the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and as the Ar@@ k of the Lord came into the city of David , Mic@@ hal Sa@@ ul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before the Lord ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I was with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies out of TH@@ Y sight , and have made the@@ e a great name , like un@@ to the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and when TH@@ Y days be fulfilled , and th@@ ou s@@ halt sle@@ ep with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , I will set up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall proceed out of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
and if so be that the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore appro@@ ached ye so n@@ igh un@@ to the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
and she had a gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs upon her : for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that were vir@@ g@@ ins appar@@ elled . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hat@@ h sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
and all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men which came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
and all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shi@@ pped God , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at rent , and ear@@ th upon his head :
and h@@ ast th@@ ou not there with the@@ e Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt hear out of the king 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them ye shall send un@@ to me every thing that ye can hear .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
and I will come upon him while he is we@@ ary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will sm@@ ite the king only :
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t : for all Israel know@@ eth that TH@@ Y father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om made A@@ masa captain of the host instead of Jo@@ a@@ b : which A@@ masa was a man 's son , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra an Isra@@ elite , that went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , be@@ hold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king .
and there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men : and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
and there was again a battle in Go@@ b with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ o@@ regi@@ m , a B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
and David sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the re@@ bu@@ king of the Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
then did I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , I did stamp them as the m@@ ire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
and that br@@ ing@@ eth me forth from mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou also h@@ ast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of J@@ es@@ se said , and the man who was raised up on high , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the swe@@ et p@@ sal@@ mist of Israel , said ,
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun ris@@ eth , even a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds ; as the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ inging out of the ear@@ th by clear sh@@ ining after rain .
and after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of len@@ ti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time un@@ to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men which belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
and they told the king , saying , be@@ hold Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t . and when he was come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
and all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th rent with the sound of them .
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est un@@ to the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
then ti@@ dings came to Jo@@ a@@ b : for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he turned not after Ab@@ sal@@ om . and Jo@@ a@@ b fled un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
for it shall be , that on the day th@@ ou go@@ est out , and pass@@ est over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , th@@ ou s@@ halt know for certain that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die : TH@@ Y blood shall be upon th@@ ine own head .
and I have also given the@@ e that which th@@ ou h@@ ast not asked , both ri@@ ches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like un@@ to the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud ; to him per@@ tained Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean , which is by Z@@ art@@ an@@ ah ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean to A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , even un@@ to the place that is beyond Jok@@ ne@@ am :
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , in the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had domin@@ ion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Az@@ z@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
bes@@ ide the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length there@@ of was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length there@@ of , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house ; and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built ch@@ ambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle : and he made ch@@ ambers round about :
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in the he@@ ight there@@ of : and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold ; and so covered the alt@@ ar which was of c@@ ed@@ ar .
and the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole alt@@ ar that was by the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
and he made a por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pil@@ lars and the th@@ ick be@@ am were before them .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set upon the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts :
and n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one chap@@ iter , and seven for the other chap@@ iter .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers upon the two pil@@ lars had po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates also above , over against the bel@@ ly which was by the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred in ro@@ ws round about upon the other chap@@ iter .
and he set up the pil@@ lars in the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called the name there@@ of J@@ ach@@ in : and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and he called the name there@@ of Bo@@ az .
and he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under the borders were four whe@@ els ; and the ax@@ let@@ re@@ es of the whe@@ els were joined to the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and a half a cu@@ bit .
and the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ let@@ re@@ es , and their nav@@ es , and their fel@@ lo@@ es , and their spok@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
and in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass of half a cu@@ bit high : and on the top of the base the led@@ ges there@@ of and the borders there@@ of were of the same .
for on the plates of the led@@ ges there@@ of , and on the borders there@@ of , he gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the pro@@ portion of every one , and addi@@ tions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard over against the south .
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons : and all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright br@@ ass .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even those did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and ox@@ en , that could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are un@@ to this day .
and I have set there a place for the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
who h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that th@@ ou promis@@ ed@@ st him : th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est also with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
yet have th@@ ou respect un@@ to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and to the pray@@ er , which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e to day :
( for they shall hear of TH@@ Y great name , and of TH@@ Y strong hand , and of TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to battle against their enemy , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and shall pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for TH@@ Y name :
and for@@ give TH@@ Y people that have sin@@ ned against the@@ e and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions where@@ in they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against the@@ e , and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before them who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y people Israel , to he@@ arken un@@ to them in all that they call for un@@ to the@@ e .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , that hat@@ h given rest un@@ to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hat@@ h not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David TH@@ Y father , saying , There shall not fail the@@ e a man upon the th@@ r@@ one of Israel .
and at this house , which is high , every one that pass@@ eth by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present un@@ to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , upon those did Solomon lev@@ y a tri@@ bute of bon@@ d@@ service un@@ to this day .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fif@@ ty , which b@@ are rule over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and king Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
bes@@ ide that he had of the mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men , and of the traffic@@ k of the sp@@ ice mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
then did Solomon build an high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , in the hill that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
for it came to pass , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , after he had s@@ mit@@ ten every male in E@@ dom ;
and when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Let me de@@ part , that I may go to mine own country .
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt ; )
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men , which they had given him , and consul@@ ted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord sp@@ ake by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite un@@ to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tri@@ bute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
the alt@@ ar also was rent , and the ashes p@@ oured out from the alt@@ ar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t that brought him back :
and it came to pass , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led for him the ass , to w@@ it , for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t d@@ wel@@ t .
and the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old pro@@ phe@@ t came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bur@@ y him .
him that di@@ eth of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and Ju@@ da@@ h did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they had committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their stead br@@ as@@ en shi@@ elds , and committed them un@@ to the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha smo@@ te him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel laid siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provoc@@ ation where@@ with he provoked the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
be@@ hold , I will take away the poster@@ ity of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and the poster@@ ity of his house ; and will make TH@@ Y house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
him that di@@ eth of Ba@@ as@@ ha in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth of his in the fields shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .

and the people that were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri hat@@ h consp@@ ired , and hat@@ h also sla@@ in the king : where@@ fore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and it came to pass , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he w@@ rought , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he she@@ wed , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , The bar@@ rel of me@@ al shall not waste , neither shall the cr@@ use of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sen@@ de@@ th rain upon the ear@@ th .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him un@@ to his mother : and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , Se@@ e , TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h .
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took an hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
and it came to pass , when mid@@ day was past , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ lock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and on the wood .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he cast himself down upon the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es ,
and when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
and he looked , and , be@@ hold , there was a c@@ ake bak@@ en on the co@@ als , and a cr@@ use of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and it shall come to pass , that him that escap@@ eth the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el shall J@@ eh@@ u s@@ lay : and him that escap@@ eth from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u shall E@@ lis@@ ha s@@ lay .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad num@@ ber@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
and they pit@@ ched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans an hundred thousand foot@@ men in one day .
and set two men , sons of Bel@@ ial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent un@@ to them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent un@@ to them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provoc@@ ation where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast provoked me to an@@ ger , and made Israel to sin .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , having put on their rob@@ es , in a vo@@ id place in the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and one was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot in the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they was@@ hed his arm@@ our ; according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he she@@ wed , and how he war@@ red , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah do@@ th rest on E@@ lis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one upon the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and smo@@ te the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them : but they went forward s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , even in their country .
and when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too sor@@ e for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even un@@ to the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
and one went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , Th@@ us and thus said the ma@@ id that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come un@@ to the@@ e , be@@ hold , I have there@@ with sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to the@@ e , that th@@ ou may@@ est rec@@ over him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his f@@ les@@ h came again like un@@ to the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the to@@ wer , he took them from their hand , and bes@@ to@@ wed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
and they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go un@@ to the camp of the Syri@@ ans : and when they were come to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
and they went after them un@@ to Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . and the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
and the woman ar@@ ose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b was his wife : and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
two and twenty years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah , the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he was the son in law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st th@@ ither , look out there J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his bre@@ th@@ ren , and carry him to an in@@ ner chamber ;
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ ha@@ b TH@@ Y master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish : and I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and sle@@ w sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent him them to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and when he came to Samar@@ ia , he sle@@ w all that remained un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , ti@@ ll he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u depar@@ ted not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall even be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the hor@@ ses came into the king 's house : and there was she sla@@ in .
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
and to mas@@ ons , and he@@ wers of stone , and to buy tim@@ ber and he@@ wed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the Lord bo@@ w@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ons , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :

and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a sa@@ vi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syri@@ ans : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their ten@@ ts , as be@@ fore@@ time .

and it came to pass , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was confirmed in his hand , that he sle@@ w his servants which had sla@@ in the king his father .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and host@@ ages , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?

but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , ye@@ a , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him : for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a went up against Dam@@ as@@ cus , and took it , and carried the people of it cap@@ tive to K@@ ir , and sle@@ w Re@@ z@@ in .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , which was before the Lord , from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between the alt@@ ar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the alt@@ ar .
and king A@@ haz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the lav@@ er from off them ; and took down the sea from off the br@@ as@@ en ox@@ en that were under it , and put it upon a pav@@ ement of stones .
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secre@@ tly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they would not hear , but har@@ dened their nec@@ ks , like to the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
and so it was at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they fear@@ ed not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent li@@ ons among them , which sle@@ w some of them .
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stret@@ ched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was A@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a did carry away Israel un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des :
at that time did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temp@@ le of the Lord , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give pledges to my lor@@ d the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will deliver the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h stood and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a :
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed ; as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in T@@ hel@@ as@@ ar ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter of the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , save th@@ ou us out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that th@@ ou art the Lord God , even th@@ ou only .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste f@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store un@@ to this day , shall be carried into Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
because they have done that which was ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even un@@ to this day .
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Am@@ on was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th , the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
and the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty and one years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h , the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Bos@@ c@@ ath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the ke@@ epers of the door have gathered of the people :
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said un@@ to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sahi@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h read :
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h which sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , As tou@@ ching the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the Lord turned not from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , where@@ with his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ations that Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him with@@ al .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h made Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king in the room of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and turned his name to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and they sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he bur@@ n@@ t the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and every great man 's house bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the re@@ mn@@ ant of the multi@@ tude , did Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
and his allow@@ ance was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .
and Can@@ a@@ an beg@@ at Z@@ id@@ on his fir@@ st@@ born , and H@@ eth ,
and Jok@@ tan beg@@ at Al@@ mo@@ dad , and She@@ le@@ p@@ h , and H@@ azar@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Jer@@ ah ,
now the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : she b@@ are Z@@ im@@ ran , and Jok@@ sh@@ an , and Med@@ an , and Mi@@ dian , and I@@ sh@@ b@@ ak , and Sh@@ u@@ ah . and the sons of Jok@@ sh@@ an ; She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
now these are the kings that re@@ ig@@ ned in the land of E@@ dom before any king re@@ ig@@ ned over the children of Israel ; Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or : and the name of his city was Din@@ ha@@ bah .
and when Hus@@ ham was dead , Had@@ ad the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , which smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
now the sons of Cal@@ e@@ b the brother of Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el were , Mes@@ ha his fir@@ st@@ born , which was the father of Z@@ ip@@ h ; and the sons of Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h the father of He@@ br@@ on .
now these were the sons of David , which were born un@@ to him in He@@ br@@ on ; the fir@@ st@@ born Am@@ non , of Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s ; the second Daniel , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s :
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Se@@ ir , having for their cap@@ tains Pe@@ la@@ ti@@ ah , and N@@ ear@@ i@@ ah , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , the sons of I@@ sh@@ i .
these are the children of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il the son of Hur@@ i , the son of Jar@@ o@@ ah , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Michael , the son of J@@ es@@ his@@ hai , the son of Jah@@ do , the son of B@@ uz ;
and un@@ to the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h , which were left of the family of that tri@@ be , were cities given out of the half tri@@ be , name@@ ly , out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , by lot , ten cities .
un@@ to the sons of Mer@@ ari were given by lot , throughout their families , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and the number of them , after their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy by their generations , heads of the house of the fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , was twenty thousand and two hundred .
all these the sons of J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , by the heads of their fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , were se@@ ven@@ teen thousand and two hundred soldiers , fit to go out for war and battle .
and Rep@@ ha@@ h was his son , also Res@@ hep@@ h , and Te@@ lah his son , and Tah@@ an his son ,
and their pos@@ sessions and habi@@ tations were , Be@@ the@@ l and the towns there@@ of , and eas@@ tw@@ ard Na@@ ar@@ an , and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard Ge@@ zer , with the towns there@@ of ; Sh@@ ec@@ hem also and the towns there@@ of , un@@ to Gaza and the towns there@@ of :
and by the borders of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , D@@ or and her towns . in these d@@ wel@@ t the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
and I@@ b@@ ne@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and E@@ lah the son of Uz@@ zi , the son of Mic@@ hri , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of S@@ hep@@ ha@@ th@@ i@@ ah , the son of Re@@ uel , the son of I@@ b@@ ni@@ j@@ ah ;
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the house of God ;
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , a thousand and seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God .
so they and their children had the over@@ sight of the gates of the house of the Lord , name@@ ly , the house of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , by wards .
some of them also were appointed to over@@ see the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the set office over the things that were made in the p@@ ans .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard after Sa@@ ul , and after his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
these also are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , he sle@@ w them , and had a name among the three .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flo@@ wn all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their bre@@ th@@ ren to be the singers with instruments of musi@@ ck , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his bre@@ th@@ ren , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their bre@@ th@@ ren , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine .
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord upon the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he comman@@ ded Israel ;
and I have been with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou h@@ ast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies from before the@@ e , and have made the@@ e a name like the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and it came to pass after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; at which time Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded G@@ ad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou prosp@@ er , if th@@ ou tak@@ est heed to fulfil the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which the Lord charged Mos@@ es with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dre@@ ad not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed .
now the L@@ evi@@ tes were num@@ ber@@ ed from the age of thirty years and up@@ ward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
so the number of them , with their bre@@ th@@ ren that were instruc@@ ted in the songs of the Lord , even all that were c@@ un@@ ning , was two hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and eight .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons ; Sim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him the chief ; )
which S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith and his bre@@ th@@ ren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fa@@ thers , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the host , had dedicated .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the sto@@ re@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the c@@ ast@@ les , was J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hat@@ h given me many sons , ) he hat@@ h chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom of the Lord over Israel .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , that spread out their w@@ ings , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
both ri@@ ches and honour come of the@@ e , and th@@ ou re@@ ign@@ est over all ; and in th@@ ine hand is power and might ; and in th@@ ine hand it is to make great , and to give strength un@@ to all .
and give un@@ to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , and TH@@ Y stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
then Solomon sp@@ ake un@@ to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fa@@ thers .
so Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but the Ar@@ k of God had David brought up from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , he put before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Con@@ gre@@ gation sought un@@ to it .
and Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing where@@ with David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found an hundred and fif@@ ty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem in mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where the Lord appeared un@@ to David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instruc@@ ted for the building of the house of God . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the posts , and the walls there@@ of , and the doors there@@ of , with gold ; and gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the walls .
and he made cha@@ ins , as in the or@@ acle , and put them on the heads of the pil@@ lars ; and made an hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
also he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under it was the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of ox@@ en , which did comp@@ ass it round about : ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about . two ro@@ ws of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of it was an hand@@ b@@ read@@ th , and the bri@@ m of it like the work of the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies ; and it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred bas@@ ons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid the doors of them with br@@ ass .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , these did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed she@@ ep and ox@@ en , which could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place : ( for all the pri@@ ests that were present were sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and did not then wait by course :
but the Lord said to David my father , For@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
T@@ ho@@ u which h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
then what pray@@ er or what supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever shall be made of any man , or of all TH@@ Y people Israel , when every one shall know his own sor@@ e and his own gri@@ ef , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and ren@@ der un@@ to every man according un@@ to all his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou only know@@ est the hear@@ ts of the children of men : )
if TH@@ Y people go out to war against their enem@@ ies by the way that th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and they pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward this city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name ;
and as for the@@ e , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and s@@ halt observe my stat@@ ues and my judg@@ ments ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and un@@ to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , where@@ in Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
as for all the people that were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of Israel ,
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel which the old men gave him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am that was over the tri@@ bute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jer@@ usalem , he gathered of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand chosen men , which were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from exec@@ ut@@ ing the pri@@ est 's office un@@ to the Lord :
and it came to pass , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had established the k@@ ing@@ dom , and had strengthened himself , he for@@ so@@ ok the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hat@@ h rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
and when Ju@@ da@@ h looked back , be@@ hold , the battle was before and behind : and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and the pri@@ ests so@@ unded with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it came to pass , that God smo@@ te Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great v@@ ex@@ ations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
then A@@ SA was wro@@ th with the se@@ er , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . and A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people the same time .
and they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught the people .
for it came to pass , that , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and the battle increased that day : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the king of Israel stayed himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
then upon Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , a Lev@@ ite of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , came the Spiri@@ t of the Lord in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
to mor@@ row go ye down against them : be@@ hold , they come up by the c@@ lif@@ f of Z@@ iz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Bro@@ ok , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and of the children of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a l@@ oud voice on high .
and on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , un@@ to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of them , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
and the fear of God was on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enem@@ ies of Israel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up to the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , he strengthened himself , and sle@@ w all his bre@@ th@@ ren with the s@@ word , and di@@ vers also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b to wife : and he w@@ rought that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment upon the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the bre@@ th@@ ren of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , that minist@@ ered to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , he sle@@ w them .
and they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the doors ;
moreover Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the hor@@ se gate by the king 's house , they sle@@ w her there .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down , and br@@ ake his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bes@@ to@@ w upon Ba@@ al@@ im .
now it came to pass , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , to w@@ it , the army that was come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : where@@ fore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in great an@@ ger .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away cap@@ tive , and brought them un@@ to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
so Jo@@ ash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and he sought God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosp@@ er .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it un@@ to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but he helped him not .
and A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem : but they brought him not into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he re@@ ig@@ ned nine and twenty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the alt@@ ar . and when the bur@@ n@@ t offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with the instruments or@@ da@@ ined by David king of Israel .
and they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought in the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of the Lord .
for there were many in the Con@@ gre@@ gation that were not sanc@@ ti@@ fied : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes had the charge of the killing of the pass@@ overs for every one that was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them un@@ to the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jer@@ usalem kept the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days with great gla@@ d@@ ness : and the L@@ evi@@ tes and the pri@@ ests praised the Lord day by day , singing with l@@ oud instruments un@@ to the Lord .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation that came out of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ gers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations that my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' speech un@@ to the people of Jer@@ usalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and honour : and he made himself treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all manner of pleas@@ ant je@@ wel@@ s ;
but did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , like un@@ to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
but he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father : for Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to all the car@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them ;
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the work@@ men that w@@ rought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found a book of the law of the Lord given by Mos@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h :
and as for the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , so shall ye say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves by the houses of your fa@@ thers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the families of the fa@@ thers of your bre@@ th@@ ren the people , and after the division of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
and they ro@@ asted the pass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other hol@@ y offer@@ ings so@@ d they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ edil@@ y among all the people .
and when the year was expired , king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and the Lord God of their fa@@ thers sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up be@@ times , and sending ; because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces ; all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with be@@ asts , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , bes@@ ide all that was will@@ ingly offered .
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i ; which took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name :
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jer@@ usalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
now when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went up in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
but the eye of their God was upon the el@@ ders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to ce@@ ase , ti@@ ll the matter came to Dar@@ i@@ us : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the cop@@ y of the letter that Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , which were on this side the river , sent un@@ to Dar@@ i@@ us the king :
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en un@@ to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then came the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now hat@@ h it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
and there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of the Me@@ des , a rol@@ l , and there@@ in was a record thus written :
and they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even a s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel .
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , a s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , which are min@@ ded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jer@@ usalem , go with the@@ e .
and all the silver and gold that th@@ ou can@@ st find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem :
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall seem good to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be dil@@ ig@@ ently done for the house of the God of heav@@ en : for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of P@@ har@@ os@@ h ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah : and with him were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of the mal@@ es an hundred and fif@@ ty .
so took the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the house of our God .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down ast@@ on@@ ied .
and at the evening sacrifice I ar@@ ose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , I fell upon my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands un@@ to the Lord my God .
and among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found that had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves : name@@ ly , of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his bre@@ th@@ ren ; Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
that Han@@ ani , one of my bre@@ th@@ ren , came , he and certain men of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days , and fas@@ ted , and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
moreover the old gate rep@@ aired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , and the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , un@@ to the th@@ r@@ one of the governor on this side the river .
the val@@ ley gate rep@@ aired Han@@ un , and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah ; they built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of , and a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts on the wall un@@ to the D@@ ung gate .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we buil@@ ded the wall , he was wro@@ th , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
and it came to pass , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known un@@ to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one un@@ to his work .
they which buil@@ ded on the wall , and they that b@@ are bur@@ den@@ s , with those that la@@ ded , every one with one of his hands w@@ rought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the buil@@ ders , every one had his s@@ word gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fif@@ ty of the Jews and rul@@ ers , bes@@ ide those that came un@@ to us from among the he@@ a@@ then that are about us .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
and of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , which took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te to wife , and was called after their name .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fa@@ thers of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to understand the words of the law .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord their God .
and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and their persec@@ ut@@ ors th@@ ou thre@@ west into the deep@@ s , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover th@@ ou led@@ dest them in the day by a cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar ; and in the night by a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
their children also multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou as the stars of heav@@ en , and b@@ rough@@ test them into the land , concerning which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st promised to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept TH@@ Y law , nor hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments and TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , where@@ with th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st testify against them .
for they have not served the@@ e in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them , and in the large and f@@ at land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est before them , neither turned they from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
and it yi@@ el@@ de@@ th much increase un@@ to the kings whom th@@ ou h@@ ast set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have domin@@ ion over our bodies , and over our c@@ attle , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Co@@ l @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sh@@ il@@ oni .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ai@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , was the ru@@ ler of the house of God .
and his bre@@ th@@ ren , chief of the fa@@ thers , two hundred for@@ ty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , an hundred twenty and eight : and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of one of the great men .
the sons of L@@ evi , the chief of the fa@@ thers , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , where@@ of one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the D@@ ung gate :
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets ; name@@ ly , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h :
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ abi@@ te should not come into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God for ever ;
and I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them : for the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
there d@@ wel@@ t men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , which brought fish , and all manner of w@@ are , and sold on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath un@@ to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I testified against them , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y lo@@ dge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
now it came to pass in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us which re@@ ig@@ ned , from India even un@@ to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his emp@@ ire , ( for it is great , ) all the wi@@ ves shall give to their hus@@ bands honour , both to great and small .
then thus came every ma@@ iden un@@ to the king ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the house of the women un@@ to the king 's house .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , of those which kept the door , were wro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and when In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bo@@ wed , and rever@@ enced Ham@@ an : for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence .
and he thought scor@@ n to lay hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone ; for they had she@@ wed him the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai : where@@ fore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud and a bitter cry ;
so Es@@ ther 's ma@@ ids and her ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins came and told it her . then was the qu@@ een exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ im@@ ent to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th from him : but he received it not .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a comman@@ d@@ ment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
then went Ham@@ an forth that day jo@@ y@@ ful and with a glad heart : but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of in@@ dign@@ ation against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sle@@ ep , and he comman@@ ded to bring the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les ; and they were read before the king .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered and said , If I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on hor@@ se@@ back , and ri@@ ders on mu@@ les , ca@@ me@@ ls , and young dro@@ med@@ aries :
and Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , and Dal@@ ph@@ on , and A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
for the Jews that were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and sle@@ w three hundred men at Sh@@ us@@ han ; but on the pre@@ y they laid not their hand .
but when Es@@ ther came before the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
and his sons went and fe@@ asted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
as for that night , let d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize upon it ; let it not be joined un@@ to the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the tw@@ il@@ ight there@@ of be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the da@@ w@@ ning of the day :
for the thing which I greatly fear@@ ed is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come un@@ to me .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt be in league with the stones of the field : and the be@@ asts of the field shall be at peace with the@@ e .
and why dost th@@ ou not par@@ don my trans@@ gres@@ sion , and take away mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
if I be w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e un@@ to me ; and if I be righ@@ te@@ ous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of conf@@ usion ; therefore see th@@ ou mine aff@@ li@@ ction ;
he that is ready to sli@@ p with his feet is as a lam@@ p desp@@ ised in the thought of him that is at ease .
T@@ ho@@ u p@@ ut@@ test my feet also in the sto@@ cks , and lo@@ ok@@ est narro@@ w@@ ly un@@ to all my p@@ aths ; th@@ ou set@@ test a print upon the he@@ els of my feet .
that which he la@@ b@@ oured for shall he restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down : according to his sub@@ stance shall the restitution be , and he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice there@@ in .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God shall cast the fur@@ y of his wr@@ ath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is e@@ ating .
on the left hand , where he do@@ th work , but I can@@ not be@@ hold him : he hi@@ de@@ th himself on the right hand , that I can@@ not see him :
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terr@@ ors of the shadow of death .
if my step hat@@ h turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blo@@ t hat@@ h cle@@ av@@ ed to mine hands ;
then was kin@@ d@@ led the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite , of the kin@@ d@@ red of R@@ am : against Jo@@ b was his wr@@ ath kin@@ d@@ led , because he justified himself rather than God .
let me not , I pra@@ y you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give f@@ lat@@ tering titles un@@ to man .
he withdra@@ w@@ eth not his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous : but with kings are they on the th@@ r@@ one ; ye@@ a , he do@@ th establish them for ever , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
even so would he have removed the@@ e out of the stra@@ it into a broad place , where there is no stra@@ it@@ ness ; and that which should be set on TH@@ Y table should be full of fat@@ ness .
and he shall be like a tree plan@@ ted by the rivers of water , that br@@ ing@@ eth forth his fruit in his season ; his le@@ af also shall not wi@@ ther ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he do@@ eth shall prosp@@ er .
but as for me , I will come into TH@@ Y house in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : and in TH@@ Y fear will I worship toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
but let all those that put their trust in the@@ e re@@ jo@@ ice : let them ever sh@@ out for joy , because th@@ ou defen@@ dest them : let them also that love TH@@ Y name be jo@@ y@@ ful in the@@ e .
if I have re@@ warded ev@@ il un@@ to him that was at peace with me ; ( ye@@ a , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
he li@@ eth in wait secre@@ tly as a lion in his den : he li@@ eth in wait to catch the poor : he do@@ th catch the poor , when he dra@@ w@@ eth him into his net .
She@@ w TH@@ Y mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O th@@ ou that sav@@ est by TH@@ Y right hand them which put their trust in the@@ e from those that rise up against them .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my bu@@ ck@@ ler , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , and my high to@@ wer .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed un@@ to my God : he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry came before him , even into his e@@ ars .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of the people ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast made me the head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enem@@ ies : ye@@ a , th@@ ou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
his going forth is from the end of the heav@@ en , and his cir@@ cu@@ it un@@ to the ends of it : and there is nothing hi@@ d from the heat there@@ of .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou make them turn their back , when th@@ ou s@@ halt make ready th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws upon TH@@ Y str@@ ings against the face of them .
I am p@@ oured out like water , and all my b@@ ones are out of joint : my heart is like wa@@ x ; it is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of my bo@@ wel@@ s .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in a time when th@@ ou may@@ est be found : su@@ rely in the floods of great waters they shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to him .
rest in the Lord , and wait pati@@ ently for him : fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of him who prosp@@ er@@ eth in his way , because of the man who br@@ ing@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt dil@@ ig@@ ently consider his place , and it shall not be .
I have not hi@@ d TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness within my heart ; I have declared TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : I have not conce@@ aled TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and TH@@ Y truth from the great Con@@ gre@@ gation .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be b@@ les@@ sed upon the ear@@ th : and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not deliver him un@@ to the will of his enem@@ ies .
Ye@@ a , mine own familiar friend , in whom I tr@@ usted , which did eat of my bread , hat@@ h lifted up his he@@ el against me .
yet the Lord will command his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the day@@ time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my pray@@ er un@@ to the God of my life .
he mak@@ eth wars to ce@@ ase un@@ to the end of the ear@@ th ; he break@@ eth the bo@@ w , and cut@@ te@@ th the spe@@ ar in s@@ under ; he bur@@ net@@ h the char@@ i@@ ot in the fire .
God shall likewise destroy the@@ e for ever , he shall take the@@ e away , and p@@ lu@@ ck the@@ e out of TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and root the@@ e out of the land of the living . Se@@ lah .
be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , O God , be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me : for my sou@@ l tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e : ye@@ a , in the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings will I make my ref@@ uge , until these cal@@ am@@ ities be over@@ past .
my sou@@ l is among li@@ ons : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose te@@ eth are spe@@ ars and ar@@ ro@@ ws , and their ton@@ gue a sharp s@@ word .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my sou@@ l is bo@@ wed down : they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it before me , into the mid@@ st where@@ of they are fallen themselves . Se@@ lah .
by ter@@ ri@@ ble things in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou answer us , O God of our sal@@ vation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the ear@@ th , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
the char@@ i@@ ots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of an@@ gel@@ s : the Lord is among them , as in S@@ ina@@ i , in the hol@@ y place .
to him that ri@@ de@@ th upon the heav@@ ens of heav@@ ens , which were of old ; lo , he do@@ th send out his voice , and that a m@@ igh@@ ty voice .
they that h@@ ate me without a cause are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully , are m@@ igh@@ ty : then I restored that which I took not away .
but as for me , my pray@@ er is un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy hear me , in the truth of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
re@@ pro@@ ach hat@@ h broken my heart ; and I am full of heav@@ iness : and I looked for some to take p@@ ity , but there was none ; and for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
by the@@ e have I been hol@@ den up from the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou art he that took me out of my mother 's bo@@ wel@@ s : my praise shall be continu@@ ally of the@@ e .
now also when I am old and gr@@ ay@@ headed , O God , for@@ sake me not ; until I have she@@ wed TH@@ Y strength un@@ to this generation , and TH@@ Y power to every one that is to come .
there shall be an hand@@ ful of cor@@ n in the ear@@ th upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit there@@ of shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
we will not hide them from their children , she@@ wing to the generation to come the pra@@ ises of the Lord , and his strength , and his won@@ der@@ ful works that he hat@@ h done .
and might not be as their fa@@ thers , a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ar@@ ight , and whose spirit was not ste@@ d@@ fast with God .
but he , being full of comp@@ as@@ sion , for@@ gave their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and destroyed them not : ye@@ a , many a time turned he his an@@ ger away , and did not stir up all his wr@@ ath .
the dead bodies of TH@@ Y servants have they given to be meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sa@@ ints un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put away mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance far from me ; th@@ ou h@@ ast made me an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to them : I am shut up , and I can@@ not come forth .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish th@@ ou the work of our hands upon us ; ye@@ a , the work of our hands establish th@@ ou it .
the Lord re@@ ig@@ net@@ h , he is clo@@ th@@ ed with maj@@ es@@ ty ; the Lord is clo@@ th@@ ed with strength , where@@ with he hat@@ h gir@@ ded himself : the world also is st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed , that it can@@ not be moved .
the Lord hat@@ h been min@@ d@@ ful of us : he will b@@ less us ; he will b@@ less the house of Israel ; he will b@@ less the house of Aaron .
though I walk in the mid@@ st of trouble , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t revive me : th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth th@@ ine hand against the wr@@ ath of mine enem@@ ies , and TH@@ Y right hand shall save me .
Th@@ ine eyes did see my sub@@ stance , yet being un@@ perfect ; and in TH@@ Y book all my members were written , which in continu@@ ance were fas@@ hi@@ oned , when as yet there was none of them .
when my spirit was overwhel@@ med within me , then th@@ ou k@@ newest my path . in the way where@@ in I walked have they priv@@ ily laid a sn@@ are for me .
for the enemy hat@@ h persec@@ uted my sou@@ l ; he hat@@ h s@@ mit@@ ten my life down to the ground ; he hat@@ h made me to d@@ well in d@@ ark@@ ness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the morning ; for in the@@ e do I trust : cause me to know the way where@@ in I should walk ; for I lift up my sou@@ l un@@ to the@@ e .
when th@@ ou li@@ est down , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be afraid : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt lie down , and TH@@ Y sle@@ ep shall be swe@@ et .
the fear of the Lord ten@@ de@@ th to life : and he that hat@@ h it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with ev@@ il .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as he that li@@ eth down in the mid@@ st of the sea , or as he that li@@ eth upon the top of a m@@ ast .
and , lo , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns , and net@@ t@@ les had covered the face there@@ of , and the stone wall there@@ of was broken down .
if th@@ ine enemy be hun@@ gry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
Th@@ ine own friend , and TH@@ Y father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into TH@@ Y brother 's house in the day of TH@@ Y cal@@ am@@ ity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
there is a generation , whose te@@ eth are as s@@ words , and their j@@ a@@ w te@@ eth as k@@ ni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from off the ear@@ th , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ id .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wis@@ dom concerning all things that are done under heav@@ en : this sor@@ e trav@@ ail hat@@ h God given to the sons of man to be exerc@@ ised there@@ with .
and who know@@ eth whether he shall be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour where@@ in I have la@@ b@@ oured , and where@@ in I have she@@ wed myself wise under the sun . this is also van@@ ity .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but wo@@ e to him that is alone when he fal@@ le@@ th ; for he hat@@ h not another to help him up .
be not ras@@ h with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and let not th@@ ine heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter any thing before God : for God is in heav@@ en , and th@@ ou upon ear@@ th : therefore let TH@@ Y words be few .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners there@@ of , saving the be@@ holding of them with their eyes ?
as he came forth of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
all things have I seen in the days of my van@@ ity : there is a just man that per@@ is@@ het@@ h in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man that prol@@ on@@ get@@ h his life in his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
it is good that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take hold of this ; ye@@ a , also from this withdraw not th@@ ine hand : for he that fear@@ eth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wis@@ dom , and the reason of things , and to know the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Fol@@ ly , even of fo@@ ol@@ ishness and mad@@ ness :
which yet my sou@@ l seek@@ eth , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
and so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the hol@@ y , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also van@@ ity .
when I applied mine heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done upon the ear@@ th : ( for also there is that neither day nor night se@@ eth sle@@ ep with his eyes : )
also their love , and their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y , is now per@@ ished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
Ye@@ a also , when he that is a fo@@ ol walk@@ eth by the way , his wis@@ dom fail@@ eth him , and he sa@@ ith to every one that he is a fo@@ ol .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the ear@@ th : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fal@@ le@@ th , there it shall be .
as th@@ ou know@@ est not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the b@@ ones do grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her that is with child : even so th@@ ou know@@ est not the works of God who mak@@ eth all .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of musi@@ ck shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cor@@ d be lo@@ os@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l be broken , or the pit@@ cher be broken at the fo@@ un@@ tain , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n .
if th@@ ou know not , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women , go TH@@ Y way forth by the foot@@ steps of the flock , and fe@@ ed TH@@ Y kids bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , and his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the tur@@ tle is heard in our land ;
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
he made the pil@@ lars there@@ of of silver , the bottom there@@ of of gold , the covering of it of pur@@ ple , the mid@@ st there@@ of being paved with love , for the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
go forth , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and be@@ hold king Solomon with the cro@@ wn where@@ with his mother crow@@ ned him in the day of his es@@ po@@ us@@ als , and in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will get me to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
TH@@ Y nec@@ k is as a to@@ wer of Iv@@ ory ; th@@ ine eyes like the fis@@ h@@ po@@ ols in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , by the gate of B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ rab@@ bi@@ m : TH@@ Y n@@ ose is as the to@@ wer of Lebanon which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward Dam@@ as@@ cus .
O that th@@ ou w@@ ert as my brother , that suc@@ ked the bre@@ asts of my mother ! when I should find the@@ e without , I would k@@ is@@ s the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I should not be desp@@ ised .
I would lead the@@ e , and bring the@@ e into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me : I would cause the@@ e to drink of sp@@ ic@@ ed wine of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even un@@ to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it ; but wounds , and bru@@ ises , and p@@ ut@@ rif@@ ying so@@ res : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither m@@ ol@@ lified with o@@ in@@ tment .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots :
the lo@@ f@@ ty looks of man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be bo@@ wed down , and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lo@@ f@@ ty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
and they shall go into the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and into the c@@ aves of the ear@@ th , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty , when he ar@@ is@@ eth to shake ter@@ ri@@ bly the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Z@@ ion , and he that remain@@ eth in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even every one that is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem :
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from the mid@@ st there@@ of by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? where@@ fore , when I looked that it should bring forth grap@@ es , brought it forth wild grap@@ es ?
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pip@@ e , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the eyes of the lo@@ f@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led :
that say , Let him make speed , and has@@ ten his work , that we may see it : and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw n@@ igh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will his@@ s un@@ to them from the end of the ear@@ th : and , be@@ hold , they shall come with speed swi@@ f@@ tly :
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the gir@@ dle of their lo@@ ins be lo@@ os@@ ed , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
their ro@@ aring shall be like a lion , they shall ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons : ye@@ a , they shall ro@@ ar , and lay hold of the pre@@ y , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and say un@@ to him , T@@ ake heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted for the two ta@@ ils of these smoking fire@@ brands , for the fierce an@@ ger of Re@@ z@@ in with Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall his@@ s for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , and in the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and upon all thor@@ ns , and upon all bus@@ hes .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
for the Lord sp@@ ake thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and he shall be for a sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of off@@ ence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a sn@@ are to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bes@@ te@@ ad and hun@@ gry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hun@@ gry , they shall fre@@ t themselves , and cur@@ se their king and their God , and look up@@ ward .
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your gl@@ ory ?
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me : and it shall bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting .
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither re@@ prove after the hearing of his e@@ ars :
and in that day there shall be a root of J@@ es@@ se , which shall stand for an en@@ sign of the people ; to it shall the Gen@@ ti@@ les seek : and his rest shall be g@@ lor@@ ious .
but they shall fly upon the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall sp@@ oil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obe@@ y them .
for the stars of heav@@ en and the con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations there@@ of shall not give their light : the sun shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to sh@@ ine .
and it shall be as the ch@@ ased ro@@ e , and as a she@@ ep that no man tak@@ eth up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
their bo@@ ws also shall d@@ ash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b ; their eye shall not spar@@ e children .
and the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall cry in their de@@ so@@ late houses , and dra@@ g@@ ons in their pleas@@ ant pal@@ aces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prol@@ on@@ ged .
for the Lord will have mer@@ cy on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the st@@ ran@@ gers shall be joined with them , and they shall cle@@ ave to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
re@@ jo@@ ice not th@@ ou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the ro@@ d of him that smo@@ te the@@ e is broken : for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root shall come forth a co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce , and his fruit shall be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
and H@@ es@@ h@@ bon shall cry , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : their voice shall be heard even un@@ to Ja@@ haz : therefore the armed soldiers of Mo@@ a@@ b shall cry out ; his life shall be gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to him .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ a@@ b is we@@ ary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y ; but he shall not prev@@ ail .
and he shall not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fin@@ gers have made , either the gro@@ ves , or the images .
Wo@@ e to the multi@@ tude of many people , which make a no@@ ise like the no@@ ise of the seas ; and to the rus@@ hing of nations , that make a rus@@ hing like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
for a@@ fore the har@@ v@@ est , when the bu@@ d is perfect , and the s@@ our gra@@ pe is ri@@ pen@@ ing in the f@@ lower , he shall both cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and take away and cut down the branches .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the bro@@ oks of defence shall be emp@@ tied and dri@@ ed up : the re@@ eds and flags shall wi@@ ther .
in that day shall Egypt be like un@@ to women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shak@@ eth over it .
and the land of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be a terror un@@ to Egypt , every one that mak@@ eth mention there@@ of shall be afraid in himself , because of the coun@@ sel of the Lord of hosts , which he hat@@ h determined against it .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and perform it .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with p@@ ain : pan@@ gs have taken hold upon me , as the pan@@ gs of a woman that trav@@ ail@@ eth : I was bo@@ wed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
and it shall come to pass , that TH@@ Y cho@@ ic@@ est val@@ ley@@ s shall be full of char@@ i@@ ots , and the hor@@ se@@ men shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his sho@@ ul@@ der ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and they shall han@@ g upon him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , all vessels of small quanti@@ ty , from the vessels of c@@ ups , even to all the vessels of fla@@ g@@ ons .
he stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , he sho@@ ok the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms : the Lord hat@@ h given a comman@@ d@@ ment against the mer@@ chan@@ t city , to destroy the strong holds there@@ of .
when thus it shall be in the mid@@ st of the land among the people , there shall be as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , and as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ing grap@@ es when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th upon the ear@@ th .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers , as the heat in a d@@ ry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cl@@ oud : the branch of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make un@@ to all people a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of win@@ es on the le@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of win@@ es on the le@@ es well refin@@ ed .
he will sw@@ allow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces ; and the re@@ bu@@ ke of his people shall he take away from off all the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and the fortress of the high For@@ t of TH@@ Y walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red the@@ e in the night ; ye@@ a , with my spirit within me will I seek the@@ e early : for when TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world will learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let favour be she@@ wed to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet will he not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness will he deal un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , and will not be@@ hold the maj@@ es@@ ty of the Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in p@@ ain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not w@@ rought any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter th@@ ou into TH@@ Y ch@@ ambers , and shut TH@@ Y doors about the@@ e : hide th@@ y@@ self as it were for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation be over@@ past .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the f@@ it@@ ches are not th@@ res@@ hed with a th@@ res@@ hing instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned about upon the cum@@ min ; but the f@@ it@@ ches are beaten out with a staff , and the cum@@ min with a ro@@ d .
moreover the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers shall be like small d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be as c@@ haf@@ f that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an in@@ stan@@ t su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field shall be es@@ te@@ emed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the de@@ af hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity , and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and shall fear the God of Israel .
for the people shall d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem : th@@ ou s@@ halt we@@ ep no more : he will be very gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the@@ e at the voice of TH@@ Y cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer the@@ e .
and th@@ ine e@@ ars shall hear a word behind the@@ e , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Y@@ e shall def@@ ile also the covering of TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of TH@@ Y m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold : th@@ ou s@@ halt cast them away as a men@@ stru@@ ous clo@@ th ; th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to it , G@@ et the@@ e hence .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and stre@@ ams of waters in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
yet he also is wise , and will bring ev@@ il , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of them that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for in that day every man shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver , and his id@@ ols of gold , which your own hands have made un@@ to you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a d@@ ry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a we@@ ary land .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than th@@ ou can@@ st perce@@ ive ; of a st@@ ammer@@ ing ton@@ gue , that th@@ ou can@@ st not understand .
their sla@@ in also shall be cast out , and their st@@ ink shall come up out of their car@@ cases , and the mountains shall be mel@@ ted with their blood .
it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day ; the smoke there@@ of shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cor@@ mor@@ ant and the bit@@ tern shall poss@@ ess it ; the ow@@ l also and the ra@@ ven shall d@@ well in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of conf@@ usion , and the stones of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall also meet with the wild be@@ asts of the island , and the sat@@ y@@ r shall cry to his fellow ; the scre@@ ech ow@@ l also shall rest there , and find for her@@ self a place of rest .
I say , say@@ est th@@ ou , ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for war : now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
now therefore give pledges , I pra@@ y the@@ e , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God , in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test , dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up un@@ to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord went forth , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans a hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great bit@@ ter@@ ness : but th@@ ou h@@ ast in love to my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption : for th@@ ou h@@ ast cast all my sin@@ s behind TH@@ Y back .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he shall fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : he shall gather the lam@@ bs with his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om , and shall g@@ ently lead those that are with young .
be@@ hold , the nations are as a drop of a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are counted as the small d@@ ust of the balance : be@@ hold , he tak@@ eth up the is@@ les as a very little thing .
it is he that sit@@ te@@ th upon the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and the inhabitants there@@ of are as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; that stret@@ ch@@ eth out the heav@@ ens as a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th them out as a tent to d@@ well in :
T@@ ho@@ u whom I have taken from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called the@@ e from the chief men there@@ of , and said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u art my ser@@ vant ; I have chosen the@@ e , and not cast the@@ e away .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt seek them , and s@@ halt not find them , even them that conten@@ ded with the@@ e : they that war against the@@ e shall be as nothing , and as a thing of n@@ ought .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ at@@ ter them : and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord , and s@@ halt gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fo@@ un@@ tains in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s : I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon pr@@ inces as upon mor@@ ter , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter tre@@ ade@@ th cla@@ y .
for I be@@ held , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no coun@@ seller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the cities there@@ of lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar do@@ th in@@ ha@@ bit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a m@@ igh@@ ty man , he shall stir up je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like a man of war : he shall cry , ye@@ a , ro@@ ar ; he shall prev@@ ail against his enem@@ ies .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , neither h@@ ast th@@ ou filled me with the f@@ at of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es : but th@@ ou h@@ ast made me to serve with TH@@ Y sin@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast we@@ ar@@ ied me with th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I will go before the@@ e , and make the cro@@ oked places stra@@ ight : I will break in pieces the gates of br@@ ass , and cut in s@@ under the bars of iron :
and I will give the@@ e the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that th@@ ou may@@ est know that I , the Lord , which call the@@ e by TH@@ Y name , am the God of Israel .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none bes@@ ide me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
and th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I shall be a la@@ dy for ever : so that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not lay these things to TH@@ Y heart , neither di@@ d@@ st remember the latter end of it .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I she@@ wed them ; I did them su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and they came to pass .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou hear@@ dest not ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou k@@ newest not ; ye@@ a , from that time that th@@ ine e@@ ar was not opened : for I knew that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest deal very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and w@@ ast called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the w@@ om@@ b .
and they thir@@ s@@ ted not when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he cla@@ ve the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
listen , O is@@ les , un@@ to me ; and he@@ arken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hat@@ h called me from the w@@ om@@ b ; from the bo@@ wel@@ s of my mother hat@@ h he made mention of my name .
the children which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , after th@@ ou h@@ ast lost the other , shall say again in th@@ ine e@@ ars , The place is too stra@@ it for me : give place to me that I may d@@ well .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be con@@ founded : therefore have I set my face like a F@@ lin@@ t , and I know that I shall not be as@@ ha@@ med .
who is among you that fear@@ eth the Lord , that obe@@ yet@@ h the voice of his ser@@ vant , that walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
art th@@ ou not it which hat@@ h dri@@ ed the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hat@@ h made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the ran@@ so@@ med to pass over ?
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hat@@ h brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hat@@ h brought up .
the Lord hat@@ h made b@@ are his hol@@ y arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the ear@@ th shall see the sal@@ vation of our God .
for ye shall not go out with has@@ te , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; the kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
he was op@@ pressed , and he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , yet he opened not his m@@ outh : he is brought as a lam@@ b to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep before her s@@ hear@@ ers is dum@@ b , so he open@@ eth not his m@@ outh .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall inher@@ it the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and make the de@@ so@@ late cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains shall de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from the@@ e , neither shall the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the Lord that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the@@ e .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt call a nation that th@@ ou know@@ est not , and nations that knew not the@@ e shall run un@@ to the@@ e because of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hat@@ h gl@@ ori@@ fied the@@ e .
so shall my word be that go@@ eth forth out of my m@@ outh : it shall not return un@@ to me vo@@ id , but it shall accomp@@ lish that which I ple@@ ase , and it shall prosp@@ er in the thing where@@ to I sent it .
Ye@@ a , they are gre@@ edy do@@ gs which can never have enough , and they are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds that can@@ not understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have we fas@@ ted , say they , and th@@ ou se@@ est not ? where@@ fore have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and th@@ ou tak@@ est no knowledge ? be@@ hold , in the day of your fast ye find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ bour@@ s .
be@@ hold , ye fast for stri@@ fe and debate , and to sm@@ ite with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
then shall TH@@ Y light break forth as the morning , and th@@ ine health shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y : and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before the@@ e ; the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall be TH@@ Y r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an hel@@ met of sal@@ vation upon his head ; and he put on the gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a clo@@ ke .
the sun shall be no more TH@@ Y light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light un@@ to the@@ e : but the Lord shall be un@@ to the@@ e an ever@@ lasting light , and TH@@ Y God TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
TH@@ Y sun shall no more go down ; neither shall TH@@ Y moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be th@@ ine ever@@ lasting light , and the days of TH@@ Y mourning shall be ended .
but ye shall be named the pri@@ ests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and in their gl@@ ory shall ye bo@@ ast yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness there@@ of go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and the sal@@ vation there@@ of as a lam@@ p that bur@@ net@@ h .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I won@@ dered that there was none to up@@ hold : therefore mine own arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to me ; and my fur@@ y , it up@@ held me .
but we are all as an un@@ clean thing , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses are as fil@@ thy ra@@ gs ; and we all do fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , have taken us away .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , be@@ hold me , be@@ hold me , un@@ to a nation that was not called by my name .
and I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of we@@ eping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of cr@@ ying .
and I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , who have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the works of their own hands .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not proc@@ ured this un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , in that th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ sak@@ en the Lord TH@@ Y God , when he led the@@ e by the way ?
a wild ass used to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleas@@ ure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not we@@ ary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
but where are TH@@ Y go@@ ds that th@@ ou h@@ ast made the@@ e ? let them arise , if they can save the@@ e in the time of TH@@ Y trouble : for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities are TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the Lord , and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answ@@ ered not ;
for I sp@@ ake not un@@ to your fa@@ thers , nor comman@@ ded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt speak all these words un@@ to them ; but they will not he@@ arken to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt also call un@@ to them ; but they will not answer the@@ e .
Ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heav@@ en know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the cr@@ ane and the sw@@ allow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our pal@@ aces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the people are v@@ ain : for one cut@@ te@@ th a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man , with the ax@@ e .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and pur@@ ple is their clo@@ thing : they are all the work of c@@ un@@ ning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting king : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his in@@ dign@@ ation .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is sp@@ o@@ iled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities were TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have ye set up al@@ tar@@ s to that sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
the Lord called TH@@ Y name , A green olive tree , fair , and of good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for even TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and the house of TH@@ Y father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with the@@ e ; ye@@ a , they have called a multi@@ tude after the@@ e : believe them not , though they speak fair words un@@ to the@@ e .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers are come upon all high places through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for the s@@ word of the Lord shall dev@@ our from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h shall have peace .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them out I will return , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and dig@@ ged , and took the gir@@ dle from the place where I had hi@@ d it : and , be@@ hold , the gir@@ dle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Ju@@ da@@ h shall be carried away cap@@ tive all of it , it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
and their no@@ bles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the p@@ its , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded , and covered their heads .
and I will cause them to be removed into all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that b@@ are them , and concerning their fa@@ thers that beg@@ at them in this land ;
and ye have done worse than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , ye walk every one after the imag@@ ination of his ev@@ il heart , that they may not he@@ arken un@@ to me :
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is Gra@@ ven upon the table of their heart , and upon the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good co@@ me@@ th ; but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ te@@ th on eg@@ gs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ te@@ th ri@@ ches , and not by right , shall leave them in the mid@@ st of his days , and at his end shall be a fo@@ ol .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that for@@ sake the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and they that de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters .
and the ves@@ sel that he made of cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter : so he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do un@@ to them .
and go forth un@@ to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the east gate , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell the@@ e ,
then came Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Top@@ he@@ t , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord had sent him to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
then P@@ ash@@ ur smo@@ te Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , sa@@ ith the Lord : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in the forest there@@ of , and it shall dev@@ our all things round about it .
and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , O king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sit@@ test upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y servants , and TH@@ Y people that enter in by these gates :
and I will give the@@ e into the hand of them that seek TH@@ Y life , and into the hand of them whose face th@@ ou fear@@ est , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken i@@ dol ? is he a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure ? where@@ fore are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all countries w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and increase .
for the land is full of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of swe@@ aring the land mour@@ net@@ h ; the pleas@@ ant places of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness are dri@@ ed up , and their course is ev@@ il , and their force is not right .
the an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and ti@@ ll he have performed the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
and the Lord hat@@ h sent un@@ to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the cand@@ le .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Az@@ z@@ ah , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are upon the face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and an ho@@ w@@ ling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled their pas@@ ture .
if so be they will he@@ arken , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way , that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il , which I purpose to do un@@ to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to he@@ arken to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I sent un@@ to you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed ;
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house un@@ to the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
I have made the ear@@ th , the man and the be@@ ast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and have given it un@@ to whom it seemed meet un@@ to me .
and now have I given all these lands un@@ to the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the be@@ asts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
Ye@@ a , thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and of Jer@@ usalem ;
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried them to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the yok@@ e from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , un@@ to all that are carried away cap@@ tives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
and out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of them that make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
be@@ hold , the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of the Lord go@@ eth forth with fur@@ y , a continuing wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it shall fall with p@@ ain upon the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
again I will build the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : th@@ ou s@@ halt again be ad@@ or@@ ned with TH@@ Y tab@@ re@@ ts , and s@@ halt go forth in the dan@@ ces of them that make mer@@ ry .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I smo@@ te upon my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , ye@@ a , even con@@ founded , because I did bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of be@@ ast .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; If heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , I will also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and h@@ ast brought forth TH@@ Y people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with great terror ;
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have only done ev@@ il before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
and I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned , and where@@ by they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
this is the word that came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people which were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty un@@ to them ;
but after@@ ward they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus have we obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b our father in all that he hat@@ h charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , nor our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do un@@ to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah : and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken un@@ to him , upon a rol@@ l of a book .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the rol@@ l in the chamber of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
then the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the rol@@ l , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
for though ye had s@@ mit@@ ten the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver the@@ e . obe@@ y , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the voice of the Lord , which I speak un@@ to the@@ e : so it shall be well un@@ to the@@ e , and TH@@ Y sou@@ l shall live .
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and br@@ ake down the walls of Jer@@ usalem .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
even they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
but I will deliver the@@ e in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not be given into the hand of the men of whom th@@ ou art afraid .
for I will su@@ rely deliver the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not fall by the s@@ word , but TH@@ Y life shall be for a pre@@ y un@@ to the@@ e : because th@@ ou h@@ ast put TH@@ Y trust in me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also sle@@ w all the Jews that were with him , even with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah set@@ te@@ th the@@ e on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , that were returned from all nations , w@@ hi@@ ther they had been driven , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in th@@ ine hand , and hide them in the cla@@ y in the bri@@ ck@@ kil@@ n , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and when he co@@ me@@ th , he shall sm@@ ite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity ; and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even un@@ to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish them that d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
as for the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken un@@ to us in the name of the Lord , we will not he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
against Egypt , against the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
come up , ye hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , ye char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men come forth ; the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians and the Lib@@ y@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ di@@ ans , that handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong hor@@ ses , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , and at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers shall not look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is sp@@ o@@ iled , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread his w@@ ings over Boz@@ ra@@ h : and at that day shall the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
I have laid a sn@@ are for the@@ e , and th@@ ou art also taken , O Bab@@ yl@@ on , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not aware : th@@ ou art found , and also caught , because th@@ ou h@@ ast stri@@ ven against the Lord .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
against him that ben@@ de@@ th let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him that lif@@ te@@ th himself up in his bri@@ g@@ and@@ ine : and spar@@ e ye not her young men ; destroy ye ut@@ ter@@ ly all her host .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and deliver every man his sou@@ l : be not cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der un@@ to her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the char@@ i@@ ot and his Ri@@ der ;
with the@@ e also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces old and young ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the young man and the ma@@ id ;
and the land shall tre@@ m@@ ble and sor@@ row : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation without an inhabi@@ tant .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Gra@@ ven images of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and her whole land shall be con@@ founded , and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , ti@@ ll he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was sor@@ e in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and put them to death in R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . thus Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his own land .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his di@@ et , there was a contin@@ ual di@@ et given him of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ eth sor@@ e in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks : among all her lov@@ ers she hat@@ h none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her , they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ad@@ versary hat@@ h spread out his hand upon all her pleas@@ ant things : for she hat@@ h seen that the he@@ a@@ then entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st command that they should not enter into TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation .
how hat@@ h the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger , and cast down from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , and remember@@ ed not his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger !
the Lord was as an enemy : he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up Israel , he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces : he hat@@ h destroyed his strong holds , and hat@@ h increased in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
mine eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my bo@@ wel@@ s are troubled , my li@@ ver is p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the su@@ ck@@ lings s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
their heart cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night : give th@@ y@@ self no rest ; let not the app@@ le of th@@ ine eye ce@@ ase .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in them in the day of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; th@@ ou h@@ ast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
the ton@@ gue of the suc@@ king child cle@@ av@@ eth to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man break@@ eth it un@@ to them .
they that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word are better than they that be sla@@ in with hunger : for these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the kings of the ear@@ th , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the ad@@ versary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
the an@@ ger of the Lord hat@@ h divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the pri@@ ests , they favoured not the el@@ ders .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , O daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ wel@@ lest in the land of U@@ z ; the c@@ up also shall pass through un@@ to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt be dr@@ un@@ ken , and s@@ halt make th@@ y@@ self nak@@ ed .
also out of the mid@@ st there@@ of came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . and this was their appearance ; they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
and their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot : and they spar@@ k@@ led like the col@@ our of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like un@@ to the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l : and they four had one lik@@ eness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el in the middle of a whe@@ el .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went , th@@ ither was their spirit to go ; and the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , ) yet shall know that there hat@@ h been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
not to many people of a st@@ range speech and of an hard language , whose words th@@ ou can@@ st not understand . su@@ rely , had I sent the@@ e to them , they would have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e .
I heard also the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures that touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els over against them , and a no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
but th@@ ou , O son of man , be@@ hold , they shall put bands upon the@@ e , and shall bin@@ d the@@ e with them , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go out among them :
and I will make TH@@ Y ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , that th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and s@@ halt not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build a For@@ t against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it round about .
for I have laid upon the@@ e the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days : so s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
and , be@@ hold , I will lay bands upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not turn the@@ e from one side to another , ti@@ ll th@@ ou h@@ ast ended the days of TH@@ Y siege .
and she hat@@ h changed my judg@@ ments into w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judg@@ ments and my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
and I will do in the@@ e that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the@@ e , and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of the@@ e will I sc@@ at@@ ter into all the winds .
and I will lay the dead car@@ cases of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones round about your al@@ tar@@ s .
he that is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he that is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he that remain@@ eth and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my fur@@ y upon them .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mourning , every one for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty : but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and of their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall poll@@ ute it .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I will bring the worst of the he@@ a@@ then , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pom@@ p of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be def@@ iled .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber .
then I looked , and , be@@ hold , in the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was above the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there appeared over them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
and when I looked , be@@ hold the four whe@@ els by the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , one whe@@ el by one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el by another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : and the appearance of the whe@@ els was as the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes round about , even the whe@@ els that they four had .
and the lik@@ eness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves : they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ our sla@@ in whom ye have laid in the mid@@ st of it , they are the f@@ les@@ h , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the mid@@ st of it .
and I will bring you out of the mid@@ st there@@ of , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
son of man , th@@ ou d@@ wel@@ lest in the mid@@ st of a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have e@@ ars to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
Y@@ e have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither made up the h@@ edge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
say un@@ to them which da@@ u@@ b it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and they shall comfor@@ t you , when ye see their ways and their do@@ ings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th both the ends of it , and the mid@@ st of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
and as for TH@@ Y nati@@ vity , in the day th@@ ou w@@ ast born TH@@ Y nav@@ el was not cut , neither w@@ ast th@@ ou was@@ hed in water to supp@@ le the@@ e ; th@@ ou w@@ ast not sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed the@@ e , to do any of these un@@ to the@@ e , to have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e ; but th@@ ou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of TH@@ Y person , in the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast born .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also taken TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given the@@ e , and ma@@ dest to th@@ y@@ self images of men , and di@@ d@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
moreover th@@ ou h@@ ast taken TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast bor@@ ne un@@ to me , and these h@@ ast th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to them to be dev@@ oured . is this of TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms a small matter ,
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast built TH@@ Y high place at every head of the way , and h@@ ast made TH@@ Y beauty to be ab@@ hor@@ red , and h@@ ast opened TH@@ Y feet to every one that passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms .
so will I make my fur@@ y toward the@@ e to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
T@@ ho@@ u art TH@@ Y mother 's daughter , that lo@@ th@@ eth her husband and her children ; and th@@ ou art the sister of TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , which lo@@ th@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was an H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
when TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate , and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate , then th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
that th@@ ou may@@ est remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open TH@@ Y m@@ outh any more because of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , when I am p@@ ac@@ ified toward the@@ e for all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
he cro@@ pped off the top of his young tw@@ ig@@ s , and carried it into a land of traffic@@ k ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will p@@ lead with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed against me .
neither hat@@ h op@@ pressed any , hat@@ h not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , but hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ,
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , sp@@ o@@ iled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked will turn from all his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hat@@ h committed , they shall not be mentioned un@@ to him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he hat@@ h done he shall live .
and they put him in ward in cha@@ ins , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
but I said un@@ to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Wal@@ k ye not in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their judg@@ ments , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them also in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would sc@@ at@@ ter them among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak un@@ to the house of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ et in this your fa@@ thers have b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out , will I rule over you :
and I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been def@@ iled ; and ye shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that ye have committed .
then said I , A@@ h Lord God ! they say of me , Do@@ th he not speak par@@ ables ?
and he hat@@ h give it to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : this s@@ word is shar@@ pen@@ ed , and it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the S@@ lay@@ er .
and it shall be un@@ to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , to them that have sworn o@@ aths : but he will call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that they may be taken .
shall I cause it to return into his she@@ ath ? I will judge the@@ e in the place where th@@ ou w@@ ast created , in the land of TH@@ Y nati@@ vity .
in the@@ e have they set light by father and mother : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e have they dealt by op@@ pression with the st@@ ran@@ ger : in the@@ e have they v@@ ex@@ ed the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dro@@ ss : all they are br@@ ass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are even the dro@@ ss of silver .
and they committed who@@ red@@ oms in Egypt ; they committed who@@ red@@ oms in their youth : there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there they bru@@ ised the te@@ ats of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
thus she committed her who@@ red@@ oms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and with all on whom she do@@ ted : with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither left she her who@@ red@@ oms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bru@@ ised the bre@@ asts of her vir@@ gin@@ ity , and p@@ oured their wh@@ ore@@ dom upon her .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her who@@ red@@ oms , in calling to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the days of her youth , where@@ in she had played the har@@ lot in the land of Egypt .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will deliver the@@ e into the hand of them whom th@@ ou ha@@ test , into the hand of them from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and th@@ ou s@@ halt break the sh@@ er@@ ds there@@ of , and p@@ lu@@ ck off th@@ ine own bre@@ asts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
yet they went in un@@ to her , as they go in un@@ to a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in un@@ to A@@ ho@@ lah and un@@ to Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall s@@ lay their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all TH@@ Y streets : he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y people by the s@@ word , and TH@@ Y strong gar@@ ris@@ ons shall go down to the ground .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made th@@ ine o@@ ars ; the company of the As@@ hur@@ ites have made TH@@ Y ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory , brought out of the is@@ les of Ch@@ it@@ tim .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon TH@@ Y walls round about , and the G@@ am@@ ma@@ di@@ ms were in TH@@ Y tow@@ ers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon TH@@ Y walls round about ; they have made TH@@ Y beauty perfect .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish did sing of the@@ e in TH@@ Y market : and th@@ ou w@@ ast rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the mid@@ st of the seas .
and all that handle the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , and all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against the@@ e , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust upon their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
when TH@@ Y war@@ es went forth out of the seas , th@@ ou fil@@ led@@ st many people ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st en@@ rich the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches and of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
be@@ hold , therefore I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers upon the@@ e , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
T@@ ho@@ u art the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set the@@ e so : th@@ ou w@@ ast upon the hol@@ y mountain of God ; th@@ ou h@@ ast walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their habi@@ tation ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
in that day will I cause the Hor@@ n of the house of Israel to bu@@ d forth , and I will give the@@ e the opening of the m@@ outh in the mid@@ st of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and the s@@ word shall come upon Egypt , and great p@@ ain shall be in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , when the sla@@ in shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multi@@ tude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
therefore his he@@ ight was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and his branches became long because of the multi@@ tude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en made their nes@@ ts in his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and under his branches did all the be@@ asts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
I have made him fair by the multi@@ tude of his branches : so that all the trees of E@@ den , that were in the gar@@ den of God , en@@ vi@@ ed him .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the he@@ a@@ then ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him : I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
they also went down into hell with him un@@ to them that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the he@@ a@@ then .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause TH@@ Y multi@@ tude to fall , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , all of them : and they shall sp@@ oil the pom@@ p of Egypt , and all the multi@@ tude there@@ of shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late , and the country shall be de@@ stitute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
it came to pass also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , un@@ to the ne@@ ther parts of the ear@@ th , with them that go down into the p@@ it .
whose graves are set in the sides of the p@@ it , and her company is round about her grave : all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all her multi@@ tude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings , and all her pr@@ inces , which with their might are laid by them that were sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with them that go down to the p@@ it .
nevertheless , if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
and they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there is no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : and they became meat to all the be@@ asts of the field , when they were sc@@ at@@ tered .
I will fe@@ ed them in a good pas@@ ture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed upon the mountains of Israel .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have tro@@ dden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
and I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause the ev@@ il be@@ asts to ce@@ ase out of the land : and they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in his season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
and they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the he@@ a@@ then , neither shall the be@@ ast of the land dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with hunger in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more .
and I will fill his mountains with his sla@@ in men : in TH@@ Y hil@@ ls , and in TH@@ Y val@@ ley@@ s , and in all TH@@ Y rivers , shall they fall that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all TH@@ Y b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid de@@ so@@ late , they are given us to consum@@ e .
then will I sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you an heart of f@@ les@@ h .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and ye shall keep my judg@@ ments , and do them .
then shall ye remember your own ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley which was full of b@@ ones ,
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come from TH@@ Y place out of the north parts , th@@ ou , and many people with the@@ e , all of them ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses , a great company , and a m@@ igh@@ ty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that my fur@@ y shall come up in my face .
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them un@@ to their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them : and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts there@@ of .
and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were toward the ou@@ tw@@ ard court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and at the side without , as one go@@ eth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
after@@ ward he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the doors of the side ch@@ ambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick round about , and the length there@@ of n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
so that the face of a man was toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
and the doors had two leaves ap@@ i@@ ece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side ch@@ ambers of the house , and th@@ ick plan@@ ks .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts which were for the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which was for the ut@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a no@@ ise of many waters : and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
now let them put away their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the car@@ cases of their kings , far from me , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of them for ever .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes that be of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , which approach un@@ to me , to minister un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord God , a young bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of cleansing it , th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer them before the Lord , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
concerning the ordin@@ ance of oil , the b@@ ath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , which is an Ho@@ mer of ten ba@@ ths ; for ten ba@@ ths are an Ho@@ mer :
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to the Lord , seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a k@@ id of the go@@ ats daily for a sin offering .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram : they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way there@@ of .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me about the way without un@@ to the ut@@ ter gate by the way that lo@@ ok@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and , be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and the subur@@ bs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred and fif@@ ty .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he d@@ rank : so no@@ ur@@ ishing them three years , that at the end there@@ of they might stand before the king .
un@@ to whom the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names : for he gave un@@ to Daniel the name of Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , of Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
then let our coun@@ ten@@ ances be looked upon before the@@ e , and the coun@@ tenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as th@@ ou se@@ est , deal with TH@@ Y servants .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the astr@@ olog@@ ers , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for to she@@ w the king his dre@@ ams . so they came and stood before the king .
and it is a rare thing that the king require@@ th , and there is none other that can she@@ w it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
Daniel answ@@ ered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hat@@ h demanded can@@ not the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , she@@ w un@@ to the king ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts , and mak@@ eth known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . TH@@ Y dream , and the visions of TH@@ Y head upon TH@@ Y bed , are these ;
and the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron : for@@ as@@ much as iron break@@ eth in pieces and sub@@ du@@ eth all things : and as iron that break@@ eth all these , shall it break in pieces and bru@@ ise .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and be@@ hold a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th , and the he@@ ight there@@ of was great .
the king sp@@ ake , and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , that I have built for the house of the k@@ ing@@ dom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from heav@@ en , saying , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to the@@ e it is spoken ; The k@@ ing@@ dom is depar@@ ted from the@@ e .
in the same hour came forth fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the cand@@ le@@ stick upon the pla@@ ister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with scar@@ let , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made a proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he la@@ b@@ oured ti@@ ll the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting : neither were instruments of musi@@ ck brought before him : and his sle@@ ep went from him .
I saw in the night visions , and , be@@ hold , one like the Son of man came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en , and came to the An@@ cient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and as I was considering , be@@ hold , an he go@@ at came from the west on the face of the whole ear@@ th , and touched not the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two hor@@ ns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran un@@ to him in the fur@@ y of his power .
Ye@@ a , he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself even to the pr@@ ince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
neither have we hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , which sp@@ ake in TH@@ Y name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
therefore hat@@ h the Lord watched upon the ev@@ il , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he do@@ eth : for we obe@@ yed not his voice .
Ye@@ a , wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking in pray@@ er , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening ob@@ lation .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there bre@@ ath left in me .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
and in his estate shall stand up a v@@ ile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in peac@@ e@@ ably , and obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many countries shall be over@@ thrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt : and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
and they that be wise shall sh@@ ine as the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the fir@@ mam@@ ent ; and they that turn many to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the stars for ever and ever .
then I Daniel looked , and , be@@ hold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days .
but I will have mer@@ cy upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bo@@ w , nor by s@@ word , nor by battle , by hor@@ ses , nor by hor@@ se@@ men .
then shall the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and s@@ lay her with thir@@ st .
therefore will I return , and take away my cor@@ n in the time there@@ of , and my wine in the season there@@ of , and will rec@@ over my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x given to cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ al@@ im , where@@ in she burned incen@@ se to them , and she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and she went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a pr@@ ince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ep@@ ho@@ d , and without ter@@ ap@@ him :
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mer@@ cy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mour@@ n , and every one that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in shall langu@@ ish , with the be@@ asts of the field , and with the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ; ye@@ a , the fis@@ hes of the sea also shall be taken away .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask coun@@ sel at their sto@@ cks , and their staff declar@@ eth un@@ to them : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms hat@@ h caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , nor your sp@@ ous@@ es when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery : for themselves are separated with who@@ res , and they sacrifice with har@@ lots : therefore the people that do@@ th not understand shall fall .
they will not frame their do@@ ings to turn un@@ to their God : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms is in the mid@@ st of them , and they have not known the Lord .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come un@@ to us as the rain , as the latter and former rain un@@ to the ear@@ th .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yok@@ e on their j@@ a@@ ws , and I laid meat un@@ to them .
they shall tre@@ m@@ ble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will place them in their houses , sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore they shall be as the morning cl@@ oud , and as the early dew that pass@@ eth away , as the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman shall come upon him : he is an un@@ wise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? pru@@ dent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall fall there@@ in .
O Lord , to the@@ e will I cry : for the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me hat@@ h burned all the trees of the field .
they shall run to and f@@ ro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall clim@@ b up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a th@@ i@@ ef .
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your gar@@ ments , and turn un@@ to the Lord your God : for he is gr@@ ac@@ ious and mer@@ ci@@ ful , slow to an@@ ger , and of great kin@@ d@@ ness , and re@@ pen@@ te@@ th him of the ev@@ il .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hat@@ h dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hand of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall sell them to the Sab@@ e@@ ans , to a people far off : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a temp@@ est in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
that p@@ ant after the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the me@@ ek : and a man and his father will go in un@@ to the same ma@@ id , to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name :
neither shall he stand that hand@@ le@@ th the bo@@ w ; and he that is swift of fo@@ ot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that ri@@ de@@ th the hor@@ se deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hat@@ h spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
can a bird fall in a sn@@ are upon the ear@@ th , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a sn@@ are from the ear@@ th , and have taken nothing at all ?
that in the day that I shall visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel upon him I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l : and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus hat@@ h the Lord God she@@ wed un@@ to me ; and , be@@ hold , he formed gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mo@@ w@@ ings .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as cor@@ n is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least gra@@ in fall upon the ear@@ th .
in that day will I raise up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches there@@ of ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
for th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st cast me into the deep , in the mid@@ st of the seas ; and the floods comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : all TH@@ Y bil@@ lows and TH@@ Y waves passed over me .
for word came un@@ to the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and he laid his ro@@ be from him , and covered him with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the shadow , ti@@ ll he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a go@@ ur@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his gri@@ ef . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the go@@ ur@@ d .
and they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
the bre@@ aker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them ; and they break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry un@@ to the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have beha@@ ved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
and he shall stand and fe@@ ed in the strength of the Lord , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into our land : and when he shall tre@@ ad in our pal@@ aces , then shall we raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight principal men .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt so@@ w , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap ; th@@ ou s@@ halt tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not ano@@ int the@@ e with oil ; and swe@@ et wine , but s@@ halt not drink wine .
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th the father , the daughter ris@@ eth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ lead my cause , and exec@@ ute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall be@@ hold his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
he will turn again , he will have comp@@ as@@ sion upon us ; he will sub@@ due our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities ; and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
the Lord is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will not at all acqu@@ it the w@@ ic@@ ked : the Lord hat@@ h his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red , the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let : the char@@ i@@ ots shall be with f@@ laming tor@@ ches in the day of his preparation , and the f@@ ir trees shall be ter@@ ri@@ bly shaken .
the Hor@@ sem@@ an lif@@ te@@ th up both the bright s@@ word and the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar : and there is a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great number of car@@ cases ; and there is none end of their cor@@ p@@ ses ; they st@@ um@@ ble upon their cor@@ p@@ ses :
TH@@ Y crow@@ ned are as the loc@@ ust@@ s , and TH@@ Y cap@@ tains as the great gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , which camp in the h@@ ed@@ ges in the cold day , but when the sun ar@@ is@@ eth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
for , lo , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , which shall march through the b@@ read@@ th of the land , to poss@@ ess the d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than the le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves : and their hor@@ se@@ men shall spread themselves , and their hor@@ se@@ men shall come from far ; they shall fly as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to eat .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the to@@ wer , and will watch to see what he will say un@@ to me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
Wo@@ e to him that c@@ ov@@ ete@@ th an ev@@ il c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness to his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the power of ev@@ il !
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ en@@ test forth for the sal@@ vation of TH@@ Y people , even for sal@@ vation with th@@ ine ano@@ in@@ ted ; th@@ ou wo@@ un@@ de@@ d@@ st the head out of the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked , by dis@@ covering the foundation un@@ to the nec@@ k . Se@@ lah .
hold TH@@ Y peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hat@@ h prepared a sacrifice , he hat@@ h bid his guests .
therefore their goods shall become a bo@@ o@@ ty , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall also build houses , but not in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but not drink the wine there@@ of .
the Lord will be ter@@ ri@@ ble un@@ to them : for he will fam@@ ish all the go@@ ds of the ear@@ th ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the is@@ les of the he@@ a@@ then .
I will also leave in the mid@@ st of the@@ e an aff@@ lic@@ ted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel shall not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh : for they shall fe@@ ed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
in the seventh month , in the one and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t Hag@@ ga@@ i , saying ,
consider now from this day and up@@ ward , from the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temp@@ le was laid , consider it .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
and they answ@@ ered the an@@ gel of the Lord that stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , We have walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th , and , be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th sit@@ te@@ th still , and is at rest .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sent me un@@ to the@@ e .
and , be@@ hold , there was lifted up a tal@@ ent of lead : and this is a woman that sit@@ te@@ th in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came four char@@ i@@ ots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of br@@ ass .
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , which are come from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and come th@@ ou the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Dar@@ i@@ us , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u ;
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and drink for yo@@ ur@@ selves ?
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and E@@ kr@@ on ; for her expec@@ tation shall be as@@ ha@@ med ; and the king shall per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a cro@@ wn , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright cl@@ ou@@ ds , and give them sho@@ wers of rain , to every one gr@@ ass in the field .
and they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , which tre@@ ad down their enem@@ ies in the m@@ ire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses shall be con@@ founded .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and L@@ aban@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall be as@@ ha@@ med every one of his vision , when he hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied ; neither shall they wear a roug@@ h gar@@ ment to dec@@ e@@ ive :
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hin@@ der sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and so shall be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the ass , and of all the be@@ asts that shall be in these ten@@ ts , as this pla@@ gue .
but ye have prof@@ an@@ ed it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is pollu@@ ted ; and the fruit there@@ of , even his meat , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble .
and I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast her fruit before the time in the field , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
then they that fear@@ ed the Lord sp@@ ake often one to another : and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed , and heard it , and a book of re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance was written before him for them that fear@@ ed the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
when they had heard the king , they depar@@ ted ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , ti@@ ll it came and stood over where the young child was .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus did reign in Ju@@ da@@ ea in the room of his father Her@@ od , he was afraid to go th@@ ither : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Gal@@ il@@ ee :
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
Y@@ e have heard that it was said by them of old time , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not kill ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
agree with th@@ ine ad@@ versary quickly , wh@@ il@@ es th@@ ou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the ad@@ versary deliver the@@ e to the judge , and the judge deliver the@@ e to the officer , and th@@ ou be cast into prison .
and if TH@@ Y right hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut if off , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say un@@ to you , Lo@@ ve your enem@@ ies , b@@ less them that cur@@ se you , do good to them that h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for them which desp@@ ite@@ fully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
but th@@ ou , when th@@ ou pray@@ est , enter into TH@@ Y clos@@ et , and when th@@ ou h@@ ast shut TH@@ Y door , pra@@ y to TH@@ Y F@@ ather which is in secret ; and TH@@ Y F@@ ather which se@@ eth in secret shall reward the@@ e openly .
and every one that he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened un@@ to a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , which built his house upon the s@@ and :
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they fa@@ in@@ ted , and were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad , as she@@ ep having no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , ti@@ ll the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be as his master , and the ser@@ vant as his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
for I am come to set a man at vari@@ ance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give to drink un@@ to one of these little ones a c@@ up of cold water only in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , and the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , and the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached to them .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth against the Holy gh@@ ost , it shall not be for@@ given him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one he@@ aret@@ h the word of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and under@@ stan@@ de@@ th it not , then co@@ me@@ th the w@@ ic@@ ked one , and cat@@ ch@@ eth away that which was so@@ wn in his heart . this is he which received se@@ ed by the way side .
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
but for@@ as@@ much as he had not to pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
and again I say un@@ to you , It is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
now there were with us seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first , when he had married a wife , dec@@ eased , and , having no issue , left his wife un@@ to his brother :
for as in the days that were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k ,
then assemb@@ led together the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people , un@@ to the palace of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has ,
and after that they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off from him , and put his own ra@@ im@@ ent on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , They par@@ ted my gar@@ ments among them , and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
now when they were going , be@@ hold , some of the watch came into the city , and she@@ wed un@@ to the chief pri@@ ests all the things that were done .
and when he had gone a little further th@@ ence , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , who also were in the ship men@@ ding their n@@ ets .
and when they could not come n@@ igh un@@ to him for the press , they uncovered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy lay .
and it came to pass , that he went through the cor@@ n fields on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n .
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high pri@@ est , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he will first bin@@ d the strong man ; and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
and it came to pass , as he so@@ wed , some fell by the way side , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
because that he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been p@@ lu@@ cked as@@ under by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces : neither could any man t@@ ame him .
and they that f@@ ed the sw@@ ine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to J@@ es@@ us , and see him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and had the Legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they la@@ ug@@ hed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
for lay@@ ing aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the w@@ ashing of po@@ ts and c@@ ups : and many other such like things ye do .
and from th@@ ence he ar@@ ose , and went into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hi@@ d .
and he began to te@@ ach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders , and of the chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and when he had called the people un@@ to him with his dis@@ cip@@ les also , he said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , ti@@ ll the Son of man were risen from the dead .
for he ta@@ ught his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said un@@ to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Ch@@ r@@ ist , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall not lose his reward .
and if TH@@ Y hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life ma@@ imed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and he ar@@ ose from th@@ ence , and co@@ me@@ th into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea by the far@@ ther side of Jordan : and the people resort un@@ to him again ; and , as he was won@@ t , he ta@@ ught them again .
and J@@ es@@ us entered into Jer@@ usalem , and into the temp@@ le : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out un@@ to B@@ eth@@ any with the twelve .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the an@@ gel@@ s which are in heav@@ en .
after two days was the feast of the pass@@ over , and of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ da@@ ea , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the course of A@@ bia : and his wife was of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of his father .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ da@@ ea , un@@ to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ; ( because he was of the house and lin@@ e@@ age of David : )
and , be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel : and the Holy gh@@ ost was upon him .
and it was revealed un@@ to him by the Holy gh@@ ost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Ad@@ di , which was the son of Cos@@ am , which was the son of El@@ mo@@ dam , which was the son of E@@ R ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eli@@ ez@@ er , which was the son of Jor@@ im , which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of J@@ uda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jon@@ an , which was the son of Eli@@ ak@@ im ,
which was the son of M@@ ele@@ a , which was the son of Men@@ an , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ a , which was the son of Na@@ than , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of J@@ es@@ se , which was the son of Ob@@ ed , which was the son of Bo@@ oz , which was the son of sal@@ mon , which was the son of Na@@ as@@ son ,
which was the son of A@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , which was the son of Ara@@ m , which was the son of Es@@ rom , which was the son of P@@ har@@ es , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an , which was the son of Ar@@ p@@ ha@@ x@@ ad , which was the son of Se@@ m , which was the son of No@@ e , which was the son of La@@ me@@ ch ,
which was the son of M@@ ath@@ us@@ ala , which was the son of E@@ no@@ ch , which was the son of Jar@@ ed , which was the son of Mal@@ ele@@ el , which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an ,
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
and rose up , and th@@ rust him out of the city , and led him un@@ to the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was built , that they might cast him down head@@ long .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any si@@ ck with di@@ vers diseases brought them un@@ to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
and un@@ to him that sm@@ ite@@ th the@@ e on the one che@@ ek offer also the other ; and him that tak@@ eth away TH@@ Y clo@@ ke for@@ bid not to take TH@@ Y co@@ at also .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are ch@@ oked with car@@ es and ri@@ ches and pleas@@ ures of this life , and bring no fruit to perf@@ ection .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his dis@@ cip@@ les : and he said un@@ to them , Let us go over un@@ to the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had dev@@ ils long time , and w@@ are no clo@@ th@@ es , neither abo@@ de in any house , but in the tom@@ bs .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue : and he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and bes@@ ought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hi@@ d , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him , she declared un@@ to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but he turned , and re@@ bu@@ ked them , and said , Y@@ e know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
and he said un@@ to them , When ye pra@@ y , say , Our F@@ ather which art in heav@@ en , H@@ allowed be TH@@ Y name . TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom come . TH@@ Y will be done , as in heav@@ en , so in ear@@ th .
and he was casting out a dev@@ il , and it was dum@@ b . and it came to pass , when the dev@@ il was gone out , the dum@@ b sp@@ ake ; and the people won@@ dered .
and it came to pass , as he sp@@ ake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ are the@@ e , and the pap@@ s which th@@ ou h@@ ast suc@@ ked .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when th@@ ine eye is single , TH@@ Y whole body also is full of light ; but when th@@ ine eye is ev@@ il , TH@@ Y body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
if then God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
and ye yo@@ ur@@ selves like un@@ to men that wait for their lor@@ d , when he will return from the w@@ edding ; that when he co@@ me@@ th and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open un@@ to him immediately .
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d when he co@@ me@@ th shall find watching : veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , that he shall gir@@ d himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and this know , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known what hour the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , that ligh@@ ten@@ eth out of the one part under heav@@ en , sh@@ in@@ eth un@@ to the other part under heav@@ en ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
they did eat , they d@@ rank , they married wi@@ ves , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
then let them which are in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the mid@@ st of it de@@ part out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
men 's hear@@ ts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the ear@@ th : for the powers of heav@@ en shall be shaken .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temp@@ le ; and at night he went out , and abo@@ de in the mount that is called the mount of ol@@ ives .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cy@@ ren@@ ian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after J@@ es@@ us .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Cal@@ v@@ ary , there they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and the mal@@ ef@@ actors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , this IS the King of the Jews .
( the same had not consen@@ ted to the coun@@ sel and de@@ ed of them ; ) he was of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews : who also himself w@@ aited for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed it , and br@@ ake , and gave to them .
and the Wor@@ d was made f@@ les@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t among us , ( and we be@@ held his gl@@ ory , the gl@@ ory as of the only be@@ gotten of the F@@ ather , ) full of grace and truth .
and when he had made a s@@ cour@@ ge of small cor@@ ds , he dro@@ ve them all out of the temp@@ le , and the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
the wind b@@ low@@ eth where it liste@@ th , and th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound there@@ of , but can@@ st not tell wh@@ ence it co@@ me@@ th , and w@@ hi@@ ther it go@@ eth : so is every one that is born of the Spiri@@ t .
and no man hat@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en , but he that came down from heav@@ en , even the Son of man which is in heav@@ en .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that he@@ aret@@ h my word , and believ@@ eth on him that sent me , hat@@ h ever@@ lasting life , and shall not come into condem@@ nation ; but is passed from death un@@ to life .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
so when they had ro@@ wed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ lon@@ gs , they see J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing n@@ igh un@@ to the ship : and they were afraid .
and this is the F@@ ather 's will which hat@@ h sent me , that of all which he hat@@ h given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , except ye eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
if a man on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day receive circum@@ c@@ ision , that the law of Mos@@ es should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every w@@ hit whole on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning at the el@@ dest , even un@@ to the last : and J@@ es@@ us was left alone , and the woman standing in the mid@@ st .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but J@@ es@@ us hi@@ d himself , and went out of the temp@@ le , going through the mid@@ st of them , and so passed by .
when he had thus spoken , he sp@@ at on the ground , and made cla@@ y of the sp@@ it@@ tle , and he ano@@ in@@ ted the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d man with the cla@@ y ,
these words sp@@ ake his parents , because they fear@@ ed the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did conf@@ ess that he was Ch@@ r@@ ist , he should be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that enter@@ eth not by the door into the she@@ ep@@ fold , but clim@@ bet@@ h up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comfor@@ ted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up has@@ ti@@ ly and went out , followed her , saying , S@@ he go@@ eth un@@ to the grave to we@@ ep there .
now both the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had given a comman@@ d@@ ment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should she@@ w it , that they might take him .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , He it is , to whom I shall give a So@@ p , when I have di@@ pped it . and when he had di@@ pped the So@@ p , he gave it to Ju@@ das Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , the son of Simon .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that believ@@ eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go un@@ to my F@@ ather .
but the Com@@ for@@ ter , which is the Holy gh@@ ost , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he shall te@@ ach you all things , and bring all things to your re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have said un@@ to you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give un@@ to you : not as the world gi@@ vet@@ h , give I un@@ to you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
remember the word that I said un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . if they have persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but when the Com@@ for@@ ter is come , whom I will send un@@ to you from the F@@ ather , even the Spiri@@ t of truth , which proce@@ ede@@ th from the F@@ ather , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not un@@ to you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedi@@ ent for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come un@@ to you ; but if I de@@ part , I will send him un@@ to you .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , That ye shall we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world shall re@@ jo@@ ice : and ye shall be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row shall be turned into joy .
be@@ hold , the hour co@@ me@@ th , ye@@ a , is now come , that ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
for I have given un@@ to them the words which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me ; and they have received them , and have known su@@ rely that I came out from the@@ e , and they have believed that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st send me .
then led they J@@ es@@ us from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has un@@ to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be def@@ iled ; but that they might eat the pass@@ over .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard that saying , he brought J@@ es@@ us forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pav@@ ement , but in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a .
and there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , the which , if they should be written every one , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
and , being assemb@@ led together with them , comman@@ ded them that they should not de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
and it was known un@@ to all the d@@ wel@@ lers at Jer@@ usalem ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch as that field is called in their proper ton@@ gue , A@@ cel@@ d@@ ama , that is to say , The field of blood .
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
for Mos@@ es truly said un@@ to the fa@@ thers , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear in all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he shall say un@@ to you .
and Ann@@ as the high pri@@ est , and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kin@@ d@@ red of the high pri@@ est , were gathered together at Jer@@ usalem .
and when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were assemb@@ led together ; and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and they sp@@ ake the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the A@@ post@@ les , and beaten them , they comman@@ ded that they should not speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
I have seen , I have seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send the@@ e into Egypt .
this is that Mos@@ es , which said un@@ to the children of Israel , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its , cr@@ ying with l@@ oud voice , came out of many that were poss@@ essed with them : and many taken with pal@@ sies , and that were la@@ me , were he@@ aled .
and when Sa@@ ul was come to Jer@@ usalem , he as@@ say@@ ed to join himself to the dis@@ cip@@ les : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a dis@@ cip@@ le .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was si@@ ck , and died : whom when they had was@@ hed , they laid her in an up@@ per chamber .
and saw heav@@ en opened , and a certain ves@@ sel des@@ cen@@ ding un@@ to him , as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ ners , and let down to the ear@@ th :
now while Peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , be@@ hold , the men which were sent from Cor@@ neli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then ti@@ dings of these things came un@@ to the e@@ ars of the church which was in Jer@@ usalem : and they sent forth Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , that he should go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch .
For@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , sub@@ ver@@ ting your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such comman@@ d@@ ment :
then came he to Der@@ be and Ly@@ str@@ a : and , be@@ hold , a certain dis@@ cip@@ le was there , named Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , the son of a certain woman , which was a Je@@ w@@ ess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
for as I passed by , and be@@ held your dev@@ o@@ tions , I found an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignor@@ antly worship , him declare I un@@ to you .
and hat@@ h made of one blood all nations of men for to d@@ well on all the face of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h determined the times before appointed , and the bo@@ unds of their habi@@ tation ;
because he hat@@ h appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by that man whom he hat@@ h or@@ da@@ ined ; where@@ of he hat@@ h given assur@@ ance un@@ to all men , in that he hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
but b@@ ade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that co@@ me@@ th in Jer@@ usalem : but I will return again un@@ to you , if God will . and he sa@@ iled from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
and we sa@@ iled th@@ ence , and came the next day over against Chi@@ os ; and the next day we arrived at Sam@@ os , and tar@@ ried at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um ; and the next day we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he has@@ ted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jer@@ usalem the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a stra@@ ight course un@@ to Co@@ os , and the day following un@@ to R@@ ho@@ des , and from th@@ ence un@@ to Pat@@ ara :
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the st@@ airs , and bec@@ kon@@ ed with the hand un@@ to the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ ence , he sp@@ ake un@@ to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come n@@ igh un@@ to Dam@@ as@@ cus about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from heav@@ en a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that sp@@ ake to me .
and when I could not see for the gl@@ ory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to him to speak , answ@@ ered , For@@ as@@ much as I know that th@@ ou h@@ ast been of many years a judge un@@ to this nation , I do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
which thing I also did in Jer@@ usalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
but she@@ wed first un@@ to them of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and at Jer@@ usalem , and throughout all the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and then to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that they should rep@@ ent and turn to God , and do works meet for rep@@ ent@@ ance .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the ship@@ men deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ ors , they committed themselves un@@ to the sea , and lo@@ os@@ ed the ru@@ d@@ der bands , and ho@@ ised up the main@@ sa@@ il to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship ag@@ round ; and the fore@@ part st@@ uck fast , and remained un@@ mov@@ eable , but the hin@@ der part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay si@@ ck of a f@@ ever and of a blo@@ ody f@@ lu@@ x : to whom Paul entered in , and pray@@ ed , and laid his hands on him , and he@@ aled him .
and when we came to Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to d@@ well by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist : for it is the power of God un@@ to sal@@ vation to every one that believ@@ eth ; to the J@@ ew first , and also to the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eter@@ nal power and God@@ head ; so that they are without exc@@ use :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not conven@@ i@@ ent ;
for when the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law un@@ to themselves :
now we know that what things so@@ ever the law sa@@ ith , it sa@@ ith to them who are under the law : that every m@@ outh may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ a 's w@@ om@@ b :
therefore we are buried with him by b@@ ap@@ tism into death : that like as Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised up from the dead by the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
for the woman which hat@@ h an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he li@@ vet@@ h ; but if the husband be dead , she is lo@@ os@@ ed from the law of her husband .
but ye are not in the f@@ les@@ h , but in the Spiri@@ t , if so be that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ well in you . now if any man have not the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is none of his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him that raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ well in you , he that raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist from the dead shall also quic@@ ken your mort@@ al bodies by his Spiri@@ t that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in you .
for if ye live after the f@@ les@@ h , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spiri@@ t do mor@@ ti@@ fy the de@@ eds of the body , ye shall live .
moreover whom he did pre@@ dest@@ in@@ ate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
who is he that condem@@ net@@ h ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist that died , ye@@ a rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a pre@@ acher ?
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
for whether we live , we live un@@ to the Lord ; and whether we die , we die un@@ to the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
nevertheless , bre@@ th@@ ren , I have written the more bol@@ dly un@@ to you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
and I am sure that , when I come un@@ to you , I shall come in the ful@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , for the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake , and for the love of the Spiri@@ t , that ye strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ;
for your obe@@ di@@ ence is come abroad un@@ to all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise un@@ to that which is good , and simple concerning ev@@ il .
for it hat@@ h been declared un@@ to me of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , by them which are of the house of Ch@@ lo@@ e , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
and base things of the world , and things which are desp@@ ised , hat@@ h God chosen , ye@@ a , and things which are not , to bring to n@@ ought things that are :
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
every man 's work shall be made manif@@ est : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
for who mak@@ eth the@@ e to differ from another ? and what h@@ ast th@@ ou that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not receive ? now if th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st receive it , why dost th@@ ou gl@@ ory , as if th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st not received it ?
and such were some of you : but ye are was@@ hed , but ye are sanc@@ ti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and by the Spiri@@ t of our God .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temp@@ le of the Holy gh@@ ost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but if any man think that he beha@@ vet@@ h himself un@@ co@@ mely toward his vir@@ gin , if she pass the f@@ lower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sin@@ net@@ h not : let them mar@@ ry .
nevertheless he that stan@@ de@@ th ste@@ d@@ fast in his heart , having no necess@@ ity , but hat@@ h power over his own will , and hat@@ h so decre@@ ed in his heart that he will keep his vir@@ gin , do@@ eth well .
but meat commen@@ de@@ th us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done un@@ to me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my g@@ lor@@ ying vo@@ id .
what is my reward then ? Ver@@ ily that , when I pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , I may make the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , that I abuse not my power in the g@@ os@@ p@@ el .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subj@@ ection : lest that by any means , when I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be a cas@@ ta@@ way .
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is it not the commun@@ ion of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is it not the commun@@ ion of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
but if any man say un@@ to you , This is offered in sacrifice un@@ to id@@ ols , eat not for his sake that she@@ wed it , and for con@@ science sake : for the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of :
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , for@@ as@@ much as he is the image and gl@@ ory of God : but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
when I was a child , I sp@@ ake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
let your women keep sil@@ ence in the churches : for it is not per@@ mitted un@@ to them to speak ; but they are comman@@ ded to be under obe@@ di@@ ence , as also sa@@ ith the law .
as tou@@ ching our brother A@@ pol@@ los , I greatly desi@@ red him to come un@@ to you with the bre@@ th@@ ren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have conven@@ i@@ ent time .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist by the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , un@@ to the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints which are in all A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ te@@ th us in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation , that we may be able to comfor@@ t them which are in any trouble , by the comfor@@ t where@@ with we ourselves are comfor@@ ted of God .
and whether we be aff@@ lic@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation , which is effec@@ tual in the en@@ during of the same suffer@@ ings which we also suffer : or whether we be comfor@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation .
and I wrote this same un@@ to you , lest , when I came , I should have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
For@@ as@@ much as ye are manif@@ est@@ ly declared to be the ep@@ ist@@ le of Ch@@ r@@ ist minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fle@@ sh@@ y tables of the heart .
in whom the go@@ d of this world hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of them which believe not , lest the light of the g@@ lor@@ ious g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should sh@@ ine un@@ to them .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al ; but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hat@@ h done , whether it be good or bad .
( for he sa@@ ith , I have heard the@@ e in a time accepted , and in the day of sal@@ vation have I succ@@ oured the@@ e : be@@ hold , now is the accepted time ; be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation . )
for if I have bo@@ asted any thing to him of you , I am not as@@ ha@@ med ; but as we sp@@ ake all things to you in truth , even so our bo@@ asting , which I made before Tit@@ us , is found a truth .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such will we be also in de@@ ed when we are present .
not bo@@ asting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's la@@ bour@@ s ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be en@@ lar@@ ged by you according to our rule ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that where@@ in they gl@@ ory , they may be found even as we .
and lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure through the ab@@ und@@ ance of the reve@@ lations , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , the mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to bu@@ ff@@ et me , lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure .
in whom ye also tr@@ usted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of your sal@@ vation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that hol@@ y Spiri@@ t of promise ,
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconc@@ ile all things un@@ to himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in ear@@ th , or things in heav@@ en .
for our g@@ os@@ p@@ el came not un@@ to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy gh@@ ost , and in much assur@@ ance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you so@@ unded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith to God @@@ -@@ @ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
nor of men sought we gl@@ ory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been bur@@ den@@ some , as the A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now we command you , bre@@ th@@ ren , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother that walk@@ eth dis@@ or@@ derly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to I am or@@ da@@ ined a pre@@ acher , and an A@@ pos@@ tle , ( I speak the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and ver@@ ity .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
if th@@ ou put the bre@@ th@@ ren in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of these things , th@@ ou s@@ halt be a good minister of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , no@@ ur@@ ished up in the words of faith and of good doc@@ tr@@ ine , where@@ un@@ to th@@ ou h@@ ast at@@ tained .
for this cause left I the@@ e in Cre@@ te , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest set in order the things that are wan@@ ting , and or@@ da@@ in el@@ ders in every city , as I had appointed the@@ e :
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
and they shall not te@@ ach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , K@@ now the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as per@@ taining to the con@@ science ;
through faith we understand that the wor@@ l@@ ds were fra@@ med by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance , obe@@ yed ; and he went out , not kno@@ wing w@@ hi@@ ther he went .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persu@@ aded of them , and embrac@@ ed them , and conf@@ essed that they were st@@ ran@@ gers and pil@@ gri@@ ms on the ear@@ th .
and truly , if they had been min@@ d@@ ful of that country from wh@@ ence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hi@@ d three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of B@@ arak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ a@@ e ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the pro@@ ph@@ ets :
looking un@@ to J@@ es@@ us the author and fin@@ is@@ her of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising the sh@@ ame , and is set down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
( for they could not en@@ dur@@ e that which was comman@@ ded , An@@ d if so much as a be@@ ast touch the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned , or th@@ rust through with a d@@ art :
be not carried about with di@@ vers and st@@ range doc@@ tr@@ ines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with me@@ ats , which have not pro@@ fi@@ ted them that have been occupied there@@ in .
be patient therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , un@@ to the coming of the Lord . be@@ hold , the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fruit of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble , even the or@@ nament of a me@@ ek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask@@ eth you a reason of the hope that is in you with me@@ ek@@ ness and fear :
for for this cause was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached also to them that are dead , that they might be jud@@ ged according to men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live according to God in the spirit .
for when they speak great s@@ wel@@ ling words of van@@ ity , they al@@ l@@ ure through the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , through much wan@@ ton@@ ness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in er@@ ror .
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led there@@ in , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
but the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved un@@ to fire against the day of judgment and per@@ di@@ tion of un@@ go@@ dly men .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Wor@@ d of life ;
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the F@@ ather is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , and the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the F@@ ather , but is of the world .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
if a man say , I love God , and ha@@ te@@ th his brother , he is a li@@ ar : for he that lov@@ eth not his brother whom he hat@@ h seen , how can he love God whom he hat@@ h not seen ?
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which th@@ ou sa@@ west in my right hand , and the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven churches : and the seven cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks which th@@ ou sa@@ west are the seven churches .
he that hat@@ h an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t sa@@ ith un@@ to the churches ; To him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the mid@@ st of the par@@ ad@@ ise of God .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write ; These things sa@@ ith the Son of God , who hat@@ h his eyes like un@@ to a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like fine br@@ ass ;
he that over@@ co@@ me@@ th , the same shall be clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and I will not blo@@ t out his name out of the book of life , but I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
and when he had opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of them that were sla@@ in for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and for@@ ty and four thousand of all the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
and the smoke of the incen@@ se , which came with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , as@@ cen@@ ded up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
and the third part of the cre@@ atures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and it was comman@@ ded them that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the se@@ al of God in their fore@@ heads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ mented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ p@@ ion , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and the shap@@ es of the loc@@ ust@@ s were like un@@ to hor@@ ses prepared un@@ to battle ; and on their heads were as it were crow@@ ns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had a king over them , which is the an@@ gel of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it , whose name in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue is Ab@@ add@@ on , but in the Greek ton@@ gue hat@@ h his name A@@ poll@@ yon .
for their power is in their m@@ outh , and in their ta@@ ils : for their ta@@ ils were like un@@ to Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and the voice which I heard from heav@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to me again , and said , G@@ o and take the little book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel which stan@@ de@@ th upon the sea and upon the ear@@ th .
and I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my m@@ outh swe@@ et as hon@@ ey : and as soon as I had e@@ aten it , my bel@@ ly was bitter .
but the court which is without the temp@@ le leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given un@@ to the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and the hol@@ y city shall they tre@@ ad under fo@@ ot for@@ ty and two months .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that as@@ cen@@ de@@ th out of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded ; and there were great voices in heav@@ en , saying , The k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of this world are become the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the great dra@@ g@@ on was cast out , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , called the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , which dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h the whole world : he was cast out into the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were cast out with him .
and I stood upon the s@@ and of the sea , and saw a be@@ ast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten hor@@ ns , and upon his hor@@ ns ten crow@@ ns , and upon his heads the name of b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y .
he that le@@ ade@@ th into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kil@@ le@@ th with the s@@ word must be killed with the s@@ word . here is the patience and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
and the smoke of their tor@@ ment as@@ cen@@ de@@ th up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever recei@@ vet@@ h the mark of his name .
and the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temp@@ le , ti@@ ll the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s were fulfilled .
and the first went , and p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the ear@@ th ; and there fell a no@@ is@@ ome and gri@@ ev@@ ous sor@@ e upon the men which had the mark of the be@@ ast , and upon them which wor@@ shi@@ pped his image .
and the sixth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the great river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates ; and the water there@@ of was dri@@ ed up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three un@@ clean spir@@ its like fro@@ gs come out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t .
for they are the spir@@ its of dev@@ ils , working mir@@ ac@@ les , which go forth un@@ to the kings of the ear@@ th and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he co@@ me@@ th , he must continue a short space .
for all nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her for@@ nic@@ ation , and the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th are wa@@ xed rich through the ab@@ und@@ ance of her de@@ lic@@ acies .
and the kings of the ear@@ th , who have committed for@@ nic@@ ation and lived deli@@ ci@@ ously with her , shall be@@ wa@@ il her , and la@@ ment for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments : for he hat@@ h jud@@ ged the great wh@@ ore , which did corrupt the ear@@ th with her for@@ nic@@ ation , and hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and shall go out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four quarters of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
and he meas@@ ured the wall there@@ of , an hundred and for@@ ty and four cu@@ bi@@ ts , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the an@@ gel .
and the nations of them which are sav@@ ed shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the ear@@ th do bring their gl@@ ory and honour into it .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel which she@@ wed me these things .
