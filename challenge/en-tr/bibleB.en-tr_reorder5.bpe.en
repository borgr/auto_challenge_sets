and God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the d@@ ark@@ ness .
and God said , Let there be a fir@@ mam@@ ent in the mid@@ st of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God made the fir@@ mam@@ ent , and divided the waters which were under the fir@@ mam@@ ent from the waters which were above the fir@@ mam@@ ent : and it was so .
and God said , Let the waters under the heav@@ en be gathered together un@@ to one place , and let the d@@ ry land appear : and it was so .
and the ear@@ th brought forth gr@@ ass , and her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after his kind , and the tree yi@@ el@@ ding fruit , whose se@@ ed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the les@@ ser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
and God set them in the fir@@ mam@@ ent of the heav@@ en to give light upon the ear@@ th ,
and God said , Let the waters bring forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly the moving cre@@ ature that hat@@ h life , and fo@@ w@@ l that may fly above the ear@@ th in the open fir@@ mam@@ ent of heav@@ en .
and God b@@ les@@ sed them , saying , Be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fo@@ w@@ l multi@@ ply in the ear@@ th .
and God said , Let the ear@@ th bring forth the living cre@@ ature after his kind , c@@ attle , and cre@@ eping thing , and be@@ ast of the ear@@ th after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the be@@ ast of the ear@@ th after his kind , and c@@ attle after their kind , and every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God saw every thing that he had made , and , be@@ hold , it was very good . and the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
thus the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th were finished , and all the host of them .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
these are the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens ,
but there went up a mist from the ear@@ th , and wat@@ ered the whole face of the ground .
and the Lord God formed man of the d@@ ust of the ground , and bre@@ ath@@ ed into his nos@@ tr@@ ils the bre@@ ath of life ; and man became a living sou@@ l .
and the Lord God plan@@ ted a gar@@ den eas@@ tw@@ ard in E@@ den ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
and a river went out of E@@ den to water the gar@@ den ; and from th@@ ence it was par@@ ted , and became into four heads .
the name of the first is P@@ ison : that is it which comp@@ ass@@ eth the whole land of Hav@@ il@@ ah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is b@@ del@@ li@@ um and the ony@@ x stone .
and the name of the second river is G@@ ih@@ on : the same is it that comp@@ ass@@ eth the whole land of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
and the name of the third river is H@@ idde@@ kel : that is it which go@@ eth toward the east of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . and the fourth river is E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
and the Lord God took the man , and put him into the gar@@ den of E@@ den to d@@ ress it and to keep it .
and the Lord God comman@@ ded the man , saying , O@@ f every tree of the gar@@ den th@@ ou may@@ est freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat of it : for in the day that th@@ ou e@@ atest there@@ of th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die .
and the Lord God caused a deep sle@@ ep to fall upon A@@ dam and he sle@@ pt : and he took one of his ri@@ bs , and closed up the f@@ les@@ h instead there@@ of ;
and the ri@@ b , which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her un@@ to the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cle@@ ave un@@ to his wife : and they shall be one f@@ les@@ h .
and they were both nak@@ ed , the man and his wife , and were not as@@ ha@@ med .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the mid@@ st of the gar@@ den , God hat@@ h said , Y@@ e shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
for God do@@ th know that in the day ye eat there@@ of , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as go@@ ds , kno@@ wing good and ev@@ il .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were nak@@ ed ; and they se@@ wed fi@@ g leaves together , and made themselves ap@@ r@@ ons .
and he said , I heard TH@@ Y voice in the gar@@ den , and I was afraid , because I was nak@@ ed ; and I hi@@ d myself .
and the man said , The woman whom th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
and I will put en@@ mity between the@@ e and the woman , and between TH@@ Y se@@ ed and her se@@ ed ; it shall bru@@ ise TH@@ Y head , and th@@ ou s@@ halt bru@@ ise his he@@ el .
thor@@ ns also and th@@ ist@@ les shall it bring forth to the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the her@@ b of the field ;
in the swe@@ at of TH@@ Y face s@@ halt th@@ ou eat bread , ti@@ ll th@@ ou return un@@ to the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast th@@ ou taken : for d@@ ust th@@ ou art , and un@@ to d@@ ust s@@ halt th@@ ou return .
un@@ to A@@ dam also and to his wife did the Lord God make co@@ ats of sk@@ ins , and clo@@ th@@ ed them .
therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the gar@@ den of E@@ den , to ti@@ ll the ground from wh@@ ence he was taken .
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den Cher@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and a f@@ laming s@@ word which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and she again b@@ are his brother A@@ bel . and A@@ bel was a keep@@ er of she@@ ep , but C@@ ain was a til@@ ler of the ground .
and in process of time it came to pass , that C@@ ain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering un@@ to the Lord .
and A@@ bel , he also brought of the fir@@ st@@ lings of his flock and of the f@@ at there@@ of . and the Lord had respect un@@ to A@@ bel and to his offering :
but un@@ to C@@ ain and to his offering he had not respect . and C@@ ain was very wro@@ th , and his coun@@ tenance fell .
and now art th@@ ou Cur@@ sed from the ear@@ th , which hat@@ h opened her m@@ outh to receive TH@@ Y brother 's blood from TH@@ Y hand ;
when th@@ ou til@@ lest the ground , it shall not hen@@ ce@@ forth yield un@@ to the@@ e her strength ; a fugitive and a v@@ ag@@ ab@@ ond s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the ear@@ th .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , T@@ her@@ e@@ fore wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever s@@ lay@@ eth C@@ ain , ven@@ ge@@ ance shall be taken on him se@@ ven@@ fold . and the Lord set a mark upon C@@ ain , lest any finding him should kill him .
and C@@ ain went out from the presence of the Lord , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of no@@ d , on the east of E@@ den .
and un@@ to E@@ no@@ ch was born Ira@@ d : and Ira@@ d beg@@ at Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el : and Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el beg@@ at Meth@@ us@@ a@@ el : and Meth@@ us@@ a@@ el beg@@ at La@@ me@@ ch .
and La@@ me@@ ch took un@@ to him two wi@@ ves : the name of the one was A@@ da@@ h , and the name of the other Zil@@ lah .
and A@@ da@@ h b@@ are J@@ ab@@ al : he was the father of such as d@@ well in ten@@ ts , and of such as have c@@ attle .
and his brother 's name was J@@ ub@@ al : he was the father of all such as handle the har@@ p and organ .
and Zil@@ lah , she also b@@ are T@@ ub@@ al @@@ -@@ @ c@@ ain , an instruc@@ ter of every arti@@ fic@@ er in br@@ ass and iron : and the sister of T@@ ub@@ al @@@ -@@ @ c@@ ain was Na@@ am@@ ah .
and La@@ me@@ ch said un@@ to his wi@@ ves , A@@ da@@ h and Zil@@ lah , He@@ ar my voice ; ye wi@@ ves of La@@ me@@ ch , he@@ arken un@@ to my speech : for I have sla@@ in a man to my wo@@ unding , and a young man to my hurt .
and to S@@ eth , to him also there was born a son ; and he called his name E@@ no@@ s : then began men to call upon the name of the Lord .
this is the book of the generations of A@@ dam . in the day that God created man , in the lik@@ eness of God made he him ;
and A@@ dam lived an hundred and thirty years , and beg@@ at a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image ; and called his name S@@ eth :
and the days of A@@ dam after he had be@@ gotten S@@ eth were eight hundred years : and he beg@@ at sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters :
and all the days that A@@ dam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
and all the days of S@@ eth were nine hundred and twelve years : and he died .
and all the days of E@@ no@@ s were nine hundred and five years : and he died .
and all the days of C@@ ain@@ an were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
and all the days of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ e@@ el were eight hundred n@@ in@@ ety and five years : and he died .
and Jar@@ ed lived an hundred six@@ ty and two years , and he beg@@ at E@@ no@@ ch :
and all the days of Jar@@ ed were nine hundred six@@ ty and two years : and he died .
and all the days of E@@ no@@ ch were three hundred six@@ ty and five years :
and Meth@@ us@@ e@@ lah lived an hundred eigh@@ ty and seven years , and beg@@ at La@@ me@@ ch :
and all the days of Meth@@ us@@ e@@ lah were nine hundred six@@ ty and nine years : and he died .
and La@@ me@@ ch lived an hundred eigh@@ ty and two years , and beg@@ at a son :
and he called his name No@@ ah , saying , This same shall comfor@@ t us concerning our work and to@@ il of our hands , because of the ground which the Lord hat@@ h Cur@@ sed .
and all the days of La@@ me@@ ch were seven hundred sev@@ enty and seven years : and he died .
and it came to pass , when men began to multi@@ ply on the face of the ear@@ th , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born un@@ to them ,
that the sons of God saw the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wi@@ ves of all which they chose .
and God saw that the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of man was great in the ear@@ th , and that every imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart was only ev@@ il continu@@ ally .
and it re@@ pen@@ ted the Lord that he had made man on the ear@@ th , and it gri@@ ev@@ ed him at his heart .
these are the generations of No@@ ah : No@@ ah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and No@@ ah walked with God .
the ear@@ th also was corrupt before God , and the ear@@ th was filled with violence .
and God looked upon the ear@@ th , and , be@@ hold , it was corrupt ; for all f@@ les@@ h had cor@@ rupted his way upon the ear@@ th .
and God said un@@ to No@@ ah , The end of all f@@ les@@ h is come before me ; for the ear@@ th is filled with violence through them ; and , be@@ hold , I will destroy them with the ear@@ th .
make the@@ e an Ar@@ k of g@@ opher wood ; rooms s@@ halt th@@ ou make in the Ar@@ k , and s@@ halt pit@@ ch it within and without with pit@@ ch .
and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
but with the@@ e will I establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt come into the Ar@@ k , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y wife , and TH@@ Y sons ' wi@@ ves with the@@ e .
and of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , two of every sort s@@ halt th@@ ou bring into the Ar@@ k , to keep them alive with the@@ e ; they shall be male and female .
of fo@@ w@@ ls after their kind , and of c@@ attle after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ear@@ th after his kind , two of every sort shall come un@@ to the@@ e , to keep them alive .
and take th@@ ou un@@ to the@@ e of all food that is e@@ aten , and th@@ ou s@@ halt gather it to the@@ e ; and it shall be for food for the@@ e , and for them .
of every clean be@@ ast th@@ ou s@@ halt take to the@@ e by se@@ ven@@ s , the male and his female : and of be@@ asts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the ear@@ th for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; and every living sub@@ stance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and No@@ ah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the ear@@ th .
and No@@ ah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves with him , into the Ar@@ k , because of the waters of the flood .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the ear@@ th .
in the sel@@ f@@ same day entered No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , into the Ar@@ k ;
they , and every be@@ ast after his kind , and all the c@@ attle after their kind , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind , and every fo@@ w@@ l after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and they went in un@@ to No@@ ah into the Ar@@ k , two and two of all f@@ les@@ h , where@@ in is the bre@@ ath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all f@@ les@@ h , as God had comman@@ ded him : and the Lord shut him in .
and the flood was for@@ ty days upon the ear@@ th ; and the waters increased , and b@@ are up the Ar@@ k , and it was lift up above the ear@@ th .
and the waters prev@@ ailed , and were increased greatly upon the ear@@ th ; and the Ar@@ k went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prev@@ ailed exce@@ ed@@ ingly upon the ear@@ th ; and all the high hil@@ ls , that were under the whole heav@@ en , were covered .
fif@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts up@@ ward did the waters prev@@ ail ; and the mountains were covered .
and all f@@ les@@ h died that moved upon the ear@@ th , both of fo@@ w@@ l , and of c@@ attle , and of be@@ ast , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , and every man :
and God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , and every living thing , and all the c@@ attle that was with him in the Ar@@ k : and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th , and the waters ass@@ w@@ aged ;
the fo@@ un@@ tains also of the deep and the windows of heav@@ en were stopped , and the rain from heav@@ en was re@@ strained ;
and the waters returned from off the ear@@ th continu@@ ally : and after the end of the hundred and fif@@ ty days the waters were ab@@ ated .
and the Ar@@ k rested in the seventh month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , upon the mountains of Ar@@ ar@@ at .
and the waters decreased continu@@ ally until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days , that No@@ ah opened the window of the Ar@@ k which he had made :
and he sent forth a ra@@ ven , which went forth to and f@@ ro , until the waters were dri@@ ed up from off the ear@@ th .
also he sent forth a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were ab@@ ated from off the face of the ground ;
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the do@@ ve out of the Ar@@ k ;
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the do@@ ve ; which returned not again un@@ to him any more .
and in the second month , on the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , was the ear@@ th dri@@ ed .
and God sp@@ ake un@@ to No@@ ah , saying ,
and No@@ ah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves with him :
every be@@ ast , every cre@@ eping thing , and every fo@@ w@@ l , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , after their kinds , went forth out of the Ar@@ k .
and No@@ ah buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord ; and took of every clean be@@ ast , and of every clean fo@@ w@@ l , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar .
every moving thing that li@@ vet@@ h shall be meat for you ; even as the green her@@ b have I given you all things .
and you , be ye fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply ; bring forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and multi@@ ply there@@ in .
and God sp@@ ake un@@ to No@@ ah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
and God said , This is the to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I make between me and you and every living cre@@ ature that is with you , for perpet@@ ual generations :
I do set my bo@@ w in the cl@@ oud , and it shall be for a to@@ ken of a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , when I bring a cl@@ oud over the ear@@ th , that the bo@@ w shall be seen in the cl@@ oud :
and the sons of No@@ ah , that went forth of the Ar@@ k , were S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h : and ham is the father of Can@@ a@@ an .
and No@@ ah began to be an hus@@ b@@ and@@ man , and he plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard :
and he d@@ rank of the wine , and was dr@@ un@@ ken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and ham , the father of Can@@ a@@ an , saw the nak@@ edn@@ ess of his father , and told his two bre@@ th@@ ren without .
and S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it upon both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , and went back@@ ward , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father ; and their faces were back@@ ward , and they saw not their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and No@@ ah aw@@ oke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done un@@ to him .
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of S@@ hem ; and Can@@ a@@ an shall be his ser@@ vant .
God shall en@@ large Jap@@ het@@ h , and he shall d@@ well in the ten@@ ts of S@@ hem ; and Can@@ a@@ an shall be his ser@@ vant .
and all the days of No@@ ah were nine hundred and fif@@ ty years : and he died .
now these are the generations of the sons of No@@ ah , S@@ hem , ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h : and un@@ to them were sons born after the flood .
the sons of Jap@@ het@@ h ; Go@@ mer , and Mag@@ o@@ g , and Mad@@ ai , and Jav@@ an , and T@@ ub@@ al , and Mes@@ h@@ ech , and Ti@@ ras .
by these were the is@@ les of the Gen@@ ti@@ les divided in their lands ; every one after his ton@@ gue , after their families , in their nations .
and the sons of ham ; C@@ ush , and M@@ iz@@ ra@@ im , and Ph@@ ut , and Can@@ a@@ an .
and the beginning of his k@@ ing@@ dom was Bab@@ el , and E@@ rec@@ h , and Acc@@ ad , and Cal@@ ne@@ h , in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar .
and the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Ger@@ ar , un@@ to Gaza ; as th@@ ou go@@ est , un@@ to So@@ dom , and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ im , even un@@ to L@@ as@@ ha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their ton@@ gues , in their countries , and in their nations .
un@@ to S@@ hem also , the father of all the children of E@@ ber , the brother of Jap@@ het@@ h the el@@ der , even to him were children born .
and un@@ to E@@ ber were born two sons : the name of one was P@@ ele@@ g ; for in his days was the ear@@ th divided ; and his brother 's name was Jok@@ tan .
and their d@@ wel@@ ling was from Mes@@ ha , as th@@ ou go@@ est un@@ to Sep@@ har a mount of the east .
these are the sons of S@@ hem , after their families , after their ton@@ gues , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of No@@ ah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the ear@@ th after the flood .
and it came to pass , as they jour@@ ne@@ yed from the east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar ; and they d@@ wel@@ t there .
and they said one to another , G@@ o to , let us make bri@@ ck , and bur@@ n them throug@@ h@@ ly . and they had bri@@ ck for stone , and sli@@ me had they for mor@@ ter .
and the Lord came down to see the city and the to@@ wer , which the children of men buil@@ ded .
and the Lord said , be@@ hold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be re@@ strained from them , which they have imag@@ ined to do .
go to , let us go down , and there con@@ found their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
so the Lord sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad from th@@ ence upon the face of all the ear@@ th : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Bab@@ el ; because the Lord did there con@@ found the language of all the ear@@ th : and from th@@ ence did the Lord sc@@ at@@ ter them abroad upon the face of all the ear@@ th .
these are the generations of S@@ hem : S@@ hem was an hundred years old , and beg@@ at Ar@@ p@@ ha@@ x@@ ad two years after the flood :
and Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took them wi@@ ves : the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai ; and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an , the father of Mil@@ ca@@ h , and the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
and the days of Ter@@ ah were two hundred and five years : and Ter@@ ah died in Har@@ an .
now the Lord had said un@@ to Ab@@ ram , G@@ et the@@ e out of TH@@ Y country , and from TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ red , and from TH@@ Y father 's house , un@@ to a land that I will she@@ w the@@ e :
and I will make of the@@ e a great nation , and I will b@@ less the@@ e , and make TH@@ Y name great ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be a b@@ les@@ sing :
and I will b@@ less them that b@@ less the@@ e , and cur@@ se him that cur@@ set@@ h the@@ e : and in the@@ e shall all families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
so Ab@@ ram depar@@ ted , as the Lord had spoken un@@ to him ; and lot went with him : and Ab@@ ram was sev@@ enty and five years old when he depar@@ ted out of Har@@ an .
and Ab@@ ram passed through the land un@@ to the place of Sic@@ hem , un@@ to the pla@@ in of Mo@@ re@@ h . and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite was then in the land .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land : and Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; for the fam@@ ine was gri@@ ev@@ ous in the land .
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall see the@@ e , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save the@@ e alive .
say , I pra@@ y the@@ e , th@@ ou art my sister : that it may be well with me for TH@@ Y sake ; and my sou@@ l shall live because of the@@ e .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ram was come into Egypt , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans be@@ held the woman that she was very fair .
the pr@@ inces also of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw her , and commen@@ ded her before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : and the woman was taken into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and he ent@@ re@@ ated Ab@@ ram well for her sake : and he had she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and he ass@@ es , and men@@ servants , and ma@@ id@@ servants , and she ass@@ es , and ca@@ me@@ ls .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h called Ab@@ ram , and said , What is this that th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to me ? why di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou not tell me that she was TH@@ Y wife ?
why sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou , S@@ he is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore be@@ hold TH@@ Y wife , take her , and go TH@@ Y way .
and Ab@@ ram went up out of Egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and lot with him , into the south .
and he went on his jour@@ neys from the south even to Be@@ the@@ l , un@@ to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Be@@ the@@ l and H@@ ai ;
un@@ to the place of the alt@@ ar , which he had made there at the first : and there Ab@@ ram called on the name of the Lord .
and lot also , which went with Ab@@ ram , had f@@ loc@@ ks , and her@@ ds , and ten@@ ts .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might d@@ well together : for their sub@@ stance was great , so that they could not d@@ well together .
and there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's c@@ attle and the her@@ d@@ men of lot 's c@@ attle : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite d@@ wel@@ led then in the land .
and Ab@@ ram said un@@ to lot , Let there be no stri@@ fe , I pra@@ y the@@ e , between me and the@@ e , and between my her@@ d@@ men and TH@@ Y her@@ d@@ men ; for we be bre@@ th@@ ren .
then lot chose him all the pla@@ in of Jordan ; and lot jour@@ ne@@ yed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Ab@@ ram d@@ wel@@ led in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and lot d@@ wel@@ led in the cities of the pla@@ in , and pit@@ ched his tent toward So@@ dom .
and the Lord said un@@ to Ab@@ ram , after that lot was separated from him , L@@ if@@ t up now th@@ ine eyes , and look from the place where th@@ ou art nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard :
for all the land which th@@ ou se@@ est , to the@@ e will I give it , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed for ever .
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th : so that if a man can number the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , then shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed also be num@@ ber@@ ed .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the b@@ read@@ th of it ; for I will give it un@@ to the@@ e .
then Ab@@ ram removed his tent , and came and d@@ wel@@ t in the pla@@ in of Mam@@ re , which is in He@@ br@@ on , and built there an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord .
and it came to pass in the days of Am@@ ra@@ ph@@ el king of Sh@@ in@@ ar , Ari@@ o@@ ch king of El@@ las@@ ar , Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer king of E@@ lam , and ti@@ dal king of nations ;
and they returned , and came to En @@@ -@@ @ mis@@ h@@ p@@ at , which is K@@ ade@@ sh , and smo@@ te all the country of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and also the Am@@ ori@@ tes that d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ ez@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Tam@@ ar .
and the val@@ e of S@@ iddi@@ m was full of sli@@ me@@ p@@ its ; and the kings of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h fled , and fell there ; and they that remained fled to the mountain .
and they took all the goods of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and all their vic@@ tuals , and went their way .
and they took lot , Ab@@ ram 's brother 's son , who d@@ wel@@ t in So@@ dom , and his goods , and depar@@ ted .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the pla@@ in of Mam@@ re the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were conf@@ eder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and when Ab@@ ram heard that his brother was taken cap@@ tive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to Dan .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smo@@ te them , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and Mel@@ chi@@ zede@@ k king of Sal@@ em brought forth bread and wine : and he was the pri@@ est of the most high God .
and he b@@ les@@ sed him , and said , b@@ les@@ sed be Ab@@ ram of the most high God , poss@@ essor of heav@@ en and ear@@ th :
and b@@ les@@ sed be the most high God , which hat@@ h delivered th@@ ine enem@@ ies into TH@@ Y hand . and he gave him ti@@ th@@ es of all .
save only that which the young men have e@@ aten , and the portion of the men which went with me , An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re ; let them take their portion .
and Ab@@ ram said , be@@ hold , to me th@@ ou h@@ ast given no se@@ ed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine he@@ ir .
and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine he@@ ir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bo@@ wel@@ s shall be th@@ ine he@@ ir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Lo@@ ok now toward heav@@ en , and tell the stars , if th@@ ou be able to number them : and he said un@@ to him , S@@ o shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed be .
and he took un@@ to him all these , and divided them in the mid@@ st , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the fo@@ w@@ ls came down upon the car@@ cases , Ab@@ ram dro@@ ve them away .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sle@@ ep fell upon Ab@@ ram ; and , lo , an hor@@ ror of great d@@ ark@@ ness fell upon him .
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge : and after@@ ward shall they come out with great sub@@ stance .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt go to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers in peace ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be buried in a good old age .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , be@@ hold a smoking fur@@ n@@ ace , and a burning lam@@ p that passed between those pieces .
now Sar@@ ai Ab@@ ram 's wife b@@ are him no children : and she had an hand@@ ma@@ id , an Egyptian , whose name was Hag@@ ar .
and Sar@@ ai Ab@@ ram 's wife took Hag@@ ar her ma@@ id the Egyptian , after Ab@@ ram had d@@ wel@@ t ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to her husband Ab@@ ram to be his wife .
and he went in un@@ to Hag@@ ar , and she conce@@ ived : and when she saw that she had conce@@ ived , her mist@@ ress was desp@@ ised in her eyes .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord found her by a fo@@ un@@ tain of water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , by the fo@@ un@@ tain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to her , Ret@@ ur@@ n to TH@@ Y mist@@ ress , and submit th@@ y@@ self under her hands .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to her , I will multi@@ ply TH@@ Y se@@ ed exce@@ ed@@ ingly , that it shall not be num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and she called the name of the Lord that sp@@ ake un@@ to her , T@@ ho@@ u God se@@ est me : for she said , H@@ ave I also here looked after him that se@@ eth me ?
and Hag@@ ar b@@ are Ab@@ ram a son : and Ab@@ ram called his son 's name , which Hag@@ ar b@@ are , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el .
and when Ab@@ ram was n@@ in@@ ety years old and nine , the Lord appeared to Ab@@ ram , and said un@@ to him , I am the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty God ; walk before me , and be th@@ ou perfect .
and I will make my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the@@ e , and will multi@@ ply the@@ e exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
and Ab@@ ram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
neither shall TH@@ Y name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but TH@@ Y name shall be Ab@@ ra@@ ham ; for a father of many nations have I made the@@ e .
and I will make the@@ e exceeding fruit@@ ful , and I will make nations of the@@ e , and kings shall come out of the@@ e .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the@@ e and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e in their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God un@@ to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e .
and God said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant therefore , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e in their generations .
this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e ; Every man child among you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised .
and ye shall circum@@ c@@ ise the f@@ les@@ h of your fo@@ res@@ kin ; and it shall be a to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant bet@@ wi@@ xt me and you .
he that is born in TH@@ Y house , and he that is bought with TH@@ Y money , must needs be circum@@ c@@ ised : and my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall be in your f@@ les@@ h for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised man child whose f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin is not circum@@ c@@ ised , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people ; he hat@@ h broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
then Ab@@ ra@@ ham fell upon his face , and la@@ ug@@ hed , and said in his heart , shall a child be born un@@ to him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sar@@ ah , that is n@@ in@@ ety years old , bear ?
and as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard the@@ e : be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly ; twelve pr@@ inces shall he be@@ get , and I will make him a great nation .
but my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant will I establish with I@@ sa@@ ac , which Sar@@ ah shall bear un@@ to the@@ e at this set time in the next year .
and he left off talking with him , and God went up from Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the st@@ ran@@ ger , were circum@@ c@@ ised with him .
and the Lord appeared un@@ to him in the pla@@ ins of Mam@@ re : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight , pass not away , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from TH@@ Y ser@@ vant :
let a little water , I pra@@ y you , be f@@ et@@ ched , and was@@ h your feet , and rest yo@@ ur@@ selves under the tree :
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham ran un@@ to the her@@ d , and f@@ et@@ cht a cal@@ f tender and good , and gave it un@@ to a young man ; and he has@@ ted to d@@ ress it .
and he took but@@ ter , and milk , and the cal@@ f which he had d@@ ressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
now Ab@@ ra@@ ham and Sar@@ ah were old and well stric@@ ken in age ; and it ce@@ ased to be with Sar@@ ah after the manner of women .
is any thing too hard for the Lord ? at the time appointed I will return un@@ to the@@ e , according to the time of life , and Sar@@ ah shall have a son .
and the men rose up from th@@ ence , and looked toward So@@ dom : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham went with them to bring them on the way .
seeing that Ab@@ ra@@ ham shall su@@ rely become a great and m@@ igh@@ ty nation , and all the nations of the ear@@ th shall be b@@ les@@ sed in him ?
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come un@@ to me ; and if not , I will know .
and the men turned their faces from th@@ ence , and went toward So@@ dom : but Ab@@ ra@@ ham stood yet before the Lord .
and the Lord went his way , as soon as he had left commun@@ ing with Ab@@ ra@@ ham : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham returned un@@ to his place .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of So@@ dom , comp@@ ass@@ ed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they called un@@ to lot , and said un@@ to him , W@@ here are the men which came in to the@@ e this night ? bring them out un@@ to us , that we may know them .
and lot went out at the door un@@ to them , and shut the door after him ,
but the men put forth their hand , and pulled lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
and they smo@@ te the men that were at the door of the house with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , both small and great : so that they we@@ ar@@ ied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is wa@@ x@@ en great before the face of the Lord ; and the Lord hat@@ h sent us to destroy it .
be@@ hold now , this city is near to flee un@@ to , and it is a little one : O@@ h , let me escape th@@ ither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my sou@@ l shall live .
the sun was risen upon the ear@@ th when lot entered into Zo@@ ar .
then the Lord ra@@ ined upon So@@ dom and upon G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h bri@@ m@@ stone and fire from the Lord out of heav@@ en ;
and he over@@ threw those cities , and all the pla@@ in , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pil@@ lar of salt .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham g@@ at up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord :
and he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the mid@@ st of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which lot d@@ wel@@ t .
and lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he fear@@ ed to d@@ well in Zo@@ ar : and he d@@ wel@@ t in a cave , he and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve se@@ ed of our father .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger ar@@ ose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and the fir@@ st@@ born b@@ are a son , and called his name Mo@@ a@@ b : the same is the father of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes un@@ to this day .
and the younger , she also b@@ are a son , and called his name Ben@@ am@@ mi : the same is the father of the children of Am@@ mon un@@ to this day .
but God came to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch in a dream by night , and said to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art but a dead man , for the woman which th@@ ou h@@ ast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
therefore A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their e@@ ars : and the men were sor@@ e afraid .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham said , Bec@@ ause I thought , su@@ rely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will s@@ lay me for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch took she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and men@@ servants , and w@@ om@@ en@@ servants , and gave them un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and restored him Sar@@ ah his wife .
so Ab@@ ra@@ ham pray@@ ed un@@ to God : and God he@@ aled A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and his wife , and his ma@@ id@@ servants ; and they b@@ are children .
and the Lord visited Sar@@ ah as he had said , and the Lord did un@@ to Sar@@ ah as he had spoken .
for Sar@@ ah conce@@ ived , and b@@ are Ab@@ ra@@ ham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham called the name of his son that was born un@@ to him , whom Sar@@ ah b@@ are to him , I@@ sa@@ ac .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham circum@@ c@@ ised his son I@@ sa@@ ac being eight days old , as God had comman@@ ded him .
and she said , Wh@@ o would have said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that Sar@@ ah should have given children su@@ ck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was we@@ an@@ ed : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham made a great feast the same day that I@@ sa@@ ac was we@@ an@@ ed .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , cast out this bon@@ d@@ woman and her son : for the son of this bon@@ d@@ woman shall not be he@@ ir with my son , even with I@@ sa@@ ac .
and the water was spent in the bot@@ tle , and she cast the child under one of the sh@@ ru@@ bs .
arise , lift up the la@@ d , and hold him in th@@ ine hand ; for I will make him a great nation .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bot@@ tle with water , and gave the la@@ d drink .
and God was with the la@@ d ; and he grew , and d@@ wel@@ t in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and became an ar@@ cher .
and he d@@ wel@@ t in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham re@@ proved A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch because of a well of water , which A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's servants had viol@@ ently taken away .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham took she@@ ep and ox@@ en , and gave them un@@ to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; and both of them made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and he said , For these seven e@@ we lam@@ bs s@@ halt th@@ ou take of my hand , that they may be a witness un@@ to me , that I have dig@@ ged this well .
and it came to pass after these things , that God did temp@@ t Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and said un@@ to him , Ab@@ ra@@ ham : and he said , be@@ hold , here I am .
then on the third day Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place af@@ ar off .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham said un@@ to his young men , abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the la@@ d will go yon@@ der and worship , and come again to you ,
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham stret@@ ched forth his hand , and took the k@@ ni@@ fe to s@@ lay his son .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham called the name of that place J@@ eh@@ ov@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ j@@ i@@ re@@ h : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord called un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham out of heav@@ en the second time ,
and said , By myself have I sworn , sa@@ ith the Lord , for because th@@ ou h@@ ast done this thing , and h@@ ast not with@@ held TH@@ Y son , th@@ ine only son :
and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ; because th@@ ou h@@ ast obe@@ yed my voice .
so Ab@@ ra@@ ham returned un@@ to his young men , and they rose up and went together to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham d@@ wel@@ t at Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and it came to pass after these things , that it was told Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , be@@ hold , Mil@@ ca@@ h , she hat@@ h also born children un@@ to TH@@ Y brother N@@ ah@@ or ;
and Sar@@ ah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of Sar@@ ah .
and Sar@@ ah died in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba ; the same is He@@ br@@ on in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham came to mour@@ n for Sar@@ ah , and to we@@ ep for her .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham stood up from before his dead , and sp@@ ake un@@ to the sons of H@@ eth , saying ,
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham stood up , and bo@@ wed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of H@@ eth .
and he commun@@ ed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and in@@ treat for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
N@@ ay , my lor@@ d , hear me : the field give I the@@ e , and the cave that is there@@ in , I give it the@@ e ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it the@@ e : bur@@ y TH@@ Y dead .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , current money with the mer@@ chan@@ t .
and after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re : the same is He@@ br@@ on in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the field , and the cave that is there@@ in , were made sure un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place by the sons of H@@ eth .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham was old , and well stric@@ ken in age : and the Lord had b@@ les@@ sed Ab@@ ra@@ ham in all things .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham said un@@ to his el@@ dest ser@@ vant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , P@@ ut , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y hand under my th@@ igh :
and I will make the@@ e swe@@ ar by the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , and the God of the ear@@ th , that th@@ ou s@@ halt not take a wife un@@ to my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I d@@ well :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt go un@@ to my country , and to my kin@@ d@@ red , and take a wife un@@ to my son I@@ sa@@ ac .
and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to him , Per@@ ad@@ venture the woman will not be willing to follow me un@@ to this land : must I needs bring TH@@ Y son again un@@ to the land from wh@@ ence th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st ?
and if the woman will not be willing to follow the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son th@@ ither again .
and the ser@@ vant put his hand under the th@@ igh of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his master , and sw@@ are to him concerning that matter .
and the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls of the ca@@ me@@ ls of his master , and depar@@ ted ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , un@@ to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and he made his ca@@ me@@ ls to k@@ ne@@ el down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
be@@ hold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and the dam@@ sel was very fair to look upon , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
and the ser@@ vant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , drink a little water of TH@@ Y pit@@ cher .
and she has@@ ted , and emp@@ tied her pit@@ cher into the t@@ roug@@ h , and ran again un@@ to the well to draw water , and drew for all his ca@@ me@@ ls .
and the man won@@ dering at her held his peace , to w@@ it whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
and she said un@@ to him , I am the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , which she b@@ are un@@ to N@@ ah@@ or .
and the man bo@@ wed down his head , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord .
and the dam@@ sel ran , and told them of her mother 's house these things .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah had a brother , and his name was Lab@@ an : and Lab@@ an ran out un@@ to the man , un@@ to the well .
and the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hat@@ h given him f@@ loc@@ ks , and her@@ ds , and silver , and gold , and men@@ servants , and ma@@ id@@ servants , and ca@@ me@@ ls , and ass@@ es .
and Sar@@ ah my master 's wife b@@ are a son to my master when she was old : and un@@ to him hat@@ h he given all that he hat@@ h .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou be clear from this my oath , when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to my kin@@ d@@ red ; and if they give not the@@ e one , th@@ ou s@@ halt be clear from my oath .
and I came this day un@@ to the well , and said , O Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , if now th@@ ou do prosp@@ er my way which I go ;
and she say to me , Bo@@ th drink th@@ ou , and I will also draw for TH@@ Y ca@@ me@@ ls : let the same be the woman whom the Lord hat@@ h appointed out for my master 's son .
and she made has@@ te , and let down her pit@@ cher from her sho@@ ul@@ der , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give TH@@ Y ca@@ me@@ ls drink also : so I d@@ rank , and she made the ca@@ me@@ ls drink also .
and now if ye will deal kin@@ dly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah is before the@@ e , take her , and go , and let her be TH@@ Y master 's son 's wife , as the Lord hat@@ h spoken .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's ser@@ vant heard their words , he wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , bo@@ wing himself to the ear@@ th .
and the ser@@ vant brought forth je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother pre@@ ci@@ ous things .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the dam@@ sel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and they sent away Re@@ bek@@ ah their sister , and her nur@@ se , and Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's ser@@ vant , and his men .
and they b@@ les@@ sed Re@@ bek@@ ah , and said un@@ to her , T@@ ho@@ u art our sister , be th@@ ou the mother of thousands of millions , and let TH@@ Y se@@ ed poss@@ ess the gate of those which h@@ ate them .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah ar@@ ose , and her dam@@ sels , and they ro@@ de upon the ca@@ me@@ ls , and followed the man : and the ser@@ vant took Re@@ bek@@ ah , and went his way .
and I@@ sa@@ ac came from the way of the well La@@ hai @@@ -@@ @ roi ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the south country .
and I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the ev@@ enti@@ de : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , the ca@@ me@@ ls were coming .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw I@@ sa@@ ac , she ligh@@ ted off the C@@ ame@@ l .
for she had said un@@ to the ser@@ vant , What man is this that walk@@ eth in the field to meet us ? and the ser@@ vant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a v@@ ail , and covered her@@ self .
and Jok@@ sh@@ an beg@@ at She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an . and the sons of D@@ ed@@ an were Ass@@ hur@@ im , and Let@@ us@@ him , and Le@@ um@@ m@@ im .
and the sons of Mi@@ dian ; Ep@@ ha@@ h , and Ep@@ her , and Han@@ o@@ ch , and A@@ bi@@ da , and El@@ da@@ ah . all these were the children of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah .
and these are the days of the years of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's life which he lived , an hundred thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen years .
then Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave up the gh@@ ost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and his sons I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ;
the field which Ab@@ ra@@ ham purchased of the sons of H@@ eth : there was Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried , and Sar@@ ah his wife .
and it came to pass after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that God b@@ les@@ sed his son I@@ sa@@ ac ; and I@@ sa@@ ac d@@ wel@@ t by the well La@@ hai @@@ -@@ @ roi .
now these are the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ ed@@ ar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their c@@ ast@@ les ; twelve pr@@ inces according to their nations .
and these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the gh@@ ost and died ; and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and they d@@ wel@@ t from Hav@@ il@@ ah un@@ to Sh@@ ur , that is before Egypt , as th@@ ou go@@ est toward As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and he died in the presence of all his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah to wife , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , the sister to Lab@@ an the Syrian .
and I@@ sa@@ ac in@@ treated the Lord for his wife , because she was bar@@ ren : and the Lord was in@@ treated of him , and Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife conce@@ ived .
and the children strugg@@ led together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and she went to inqu@@ ire of the Lord .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , be@@ hold , there were tw@@ ins in her w@@ om@@ b .
and the boys grew : and E@@ sa@@ u was a c@@ un@@ ning hun@@ ter , a man of the field ; and Jac@@ o@@ b was a pla@@ in man , d@@ wel@@ ling in ten@@ ts .
and Jac@@ o@@ b said , Sel@@ l me this day TH@@ Y birth@@ right .
then Jac@@ o@@ b gave E@@ sa@@ u bread and po@@ tt@@ age of len@@ ti@@ les ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus E@@ sa@@ u desp@@ ised his birth@@ right .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land , bes@@ ide the first fam@@ ine that was in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . and I@@ sa@@ ac went un@@ to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines un@@ to Ger@@ ar .
and the Lord appeared un@@ to him , and said , G@@ o not down into Egypt ; d@@ well in the land which I shall tell the@@ e of :
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to multi@@ ply as the stars of heav@@ en , and will give un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed all these countries ; and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was spor@@ ting with Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch said , What is this th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to us ? one of the people might lightly have li@@ en with TH@@ Y wife , and th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest have brought guil@@ tin@@ ess upon us .
for he had possession of f@@ loc@@ ks , and pos@@ sessions of her@@ ds , and great store of servants : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ vi@@ ed him .
for all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them , and filled them with ear@@ th .
and I@@ sa@@ ac depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and pit@@ ched his tent in the val@@ ley of Ger@@ ar , and d@@ wel@@ t there .
and I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants dig@@ ged in the val@@ ley , and found there a well of spr@@ inging water .
and he buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar there , and called upon the name of the Lord and pit@@ ched his tent there : and there I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants dig@@ ged a well .
then A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch went to him from Ger@@ ar , and Ah@@ uz@@ z@@ ath one of his friends , and P@@ hic@@ hol the chief captain of his army .
and they rose up be@@ times in the morning , and sw@@ are one to another : and I@@ sa@@ ac sent them away , and they depar@@ ted from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dig@@ ged , and said un@@ to him , We have found water .
and E@@ sa@@ u was for@@ ty years old when he took to wife Judi@@ th the daughter of Be@@ eri the H@@ itti@@ te , and B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te :
now therefore take , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y weapons , TH@@ Y qu@@ i@@ ver and TH@@ Y bo@@ w , and go out to the field , and take me some ven@@ ison ;
and make me sav@@ our@@ y meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my sou@@ l may b@@ less the@@ e before I die .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah heard when I@@ sa@@ ac sp@@ ake to E@@ sa@@ u his son . and E@@ sa@@ u went to the field to hunt for ven@@ ison , and to bring it .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah sp@@ ake un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b her son , saying , be@@ hold , I heard TH@@ Y father speak un@@ to E@@ sa@@ u TH@@ Y brother , saying ,
now therefore , my son , obe@@ y my voice according to that which I command the@@ e .
go now to the flock , and f@@ et@@ ch me from th@@ ence two good kids of the go@@ ats ; and I will make them sav@@ our@@ y meat for TH@@ Y father , such as he lov@@ eth :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring it to TH@@ Y father , that he may eat , and that he may b@@ less the@@ e before his death .
and Jac@@ o@@ b said to Re@@ bek@@ ah his mother , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u my brother is a ha@@ iry man , and I am a smooth man :
my father per@@ ad@@ venture will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver ; and I shall bring a cur@@ se upon me , and not a b@@ les@@ sing .
and he went , and f@@ et@@ ched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made sav@@ our@@ y meat , such as his father lov@@ ed .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah took good@@ ly ra@@ im@@ ent of her el@@ dest son E@@ sa@@ u , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jac@@ o@@ b her younger son :
and she put the sk@@ ins of the kids of the go@@ ats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his nec@@ k :
and she gave the sav@@ our@@ y meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jac@@ o@@ b .
and I@@ sa@@ ac said un@@ to his son , Ho@@ w is it that th@@ ou h@@ ast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Bec@@ ause the Lord TH@@ Y God brought it to me .
and Jac@@ o@@ b went near un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jac@@ o@@ b 's voice , but the hands are the hands of E@@ sa@@ u .
and he dis@@ cer@@ ned him not , because his hands were ha@@ iry , as his brother E@@ sa@@ u 's hands : so he b@@ les@@ sed him .
and he said , Art th@@ ou my very son E@@ sa@@ u ? and he said , I am .
and his father I@@ sa@@ ac said un@@ to him , C@@ ome near now , and k@@ is@@ s me , my son .
therefore God give the@@ e of the dew of heav@@ en , and the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th , and plenty of cor@@ n and wine :
and he also had made sav@@ our@@ y meat , and brought it un@@ to his father , and said un@@ to his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's ven@@ ison , that TH@@ Y sou@@ l may b@@ less me .
and when E@@ sa@@ u heard the words of his father , he cri@@ ed with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said un@@ to his father , b@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and he said , Th@@ y brother came with sub@@ til@@ ty , and hat@@ h taken away TH@@ Y b@@ les@@ sing .
and I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling shall be the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th , and of the dew of heav@@ en from above ;
and by TH@@ Y s@@ word s@@ halt th@@ ou live , and s@@ halt serve TH@@ Y brother ; and it shall come to pass when th@@ ou s@@ halt have the domin@@ ion , that th@@ ou s@@ halt break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
now therefore , my son , obe@@ y my voice ; and arise , flee th@@ ou to Lab@@ an my brother to Har@@ an ;
and I@@ sa@@ ac called Jac@@ o@@ b , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and charged him , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not take a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an .
and God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty b@@ less the@@ e , and make the@@ e fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply the@@ e , that th@@ ou may@@ est be a multi@@ tude of people ;
and give the@@ e the b@@ les@@ sing of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed with the@@ e ; that th@@ ou may@@ est inher@@ it the land where@@ in th@@ ou art a st@@ ran@@ ger , which God gave un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and I@@ sa@@ ac sent away Jac@@ o@@ b : and he went to P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am un@@ to Lab@@ an , son of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian , the brother of Re@@ bek@@ ah , Jac@@ o@@ b 's and E@@ sa@@ u 's mother .
and E@@ sa@@ u seeing that the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an pleased not I@@ sa@@ ac his father ;
then went E@@ sa@@ u un@@ to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took un@@ to the wi@@ ves which he had Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , the sister of N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th , to be his wife .
and he dre@@ amed , and be@@ hold a la@@ d@@ der set up on the ear@@ th , and the top of it reached to heav@@ en : and be@@ hold the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
and Jac@@ o@@ b aw@@ aked out of his sle@@ ep , and he said , su@@ rely the Lord is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Be@@ the@@ l : but the name of that city was called L@@ uz at the first .
so that I come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the Lord be my God :
and this stone , which I have set for a pil@@ lar , shall be God 's house : and of all that th@@ ou s@@ halt give me I will su@@ rely give the tenth un@@ to the@@ e .
then Jac@@ o@@ b went on his journey , and came into the land of the people of the east .
and th@@ ither were all the f@@ loc@@ ks gathered : and they rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the she@@ ep , and put the stone again upon the well 's m@@ outh in his place .
and he said , L@@ o , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the c@@ attle should be gathered together : water ye the she@@ ep , and go and fe@@ ed them .
and they said , We can@@ not , until all the f@@ loc@@ ks be gathered together , and ti@@ ll they rol@@ l the stone from the well 's m@@ outh ; then we water the she@@ ep .
and while he yet sp@@ ake with them , R@@ ach@@ el came with her father 's she@@ ep : for she kept them .
and Jac@@ o@@ b k@@ is@@ sed R@@ ach@@ el , and lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and Jac@@ o@@ b told R@@ ach@@ el that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Re@@ bek@@ ah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and Lab@@ an said , It is better that I give her to the@@ e , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and Jac@@ o@@ b served seven years for R@@ ach@@ el ; and they seemed un@@ to him but a few days , for the love he had to her .
and Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to Lab@@ an , Gi@@ ve me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in un@@ to her .
and Lab@@ an gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in un@@ to her .
and Lab@@ an gave un@@ to his daughter Le@@ ah Zil@@ p@@ ah his ma@@ id for an hand@@ ma@@ id .
and Lab@@ an gave to R@@ ach@@ el his daughter Bil@@ ha@@ h his hand@@ ma@@ id to be her ma@@ id .
and he went in also un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el , and he lov@@ ed also R@@ ach@@ el more than Le@@ ah , and served with him yet seven other years .
and when the Lord saw that Le@@ ah was ha@@ ted , he opened her w@@ om@@ b : but R@@ ach@@ el was bar@@ ren .
and she conce@@ ived again , and b@@ are a son ; and said , Bec@@ ause the Lord hat@@ h heard that I was ha@@ ted , he hat@@ h therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and when R@@ ach@@ el saw that she b@@ are Jac@@ o@@ b no children , R@@ ach@@ el en@@ vi@@ ed her sister ; and said un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , Gi@@ ve me children , or else I die .
and Jac@@ o@@ b 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against R@@ ach@@ el : and he said , A@@ m I in God 's stead , who hat@@ h with@@ held from the@@ e the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b ?
and R@@ ach@@ el said , With great wrest@@ lings have I wrest@@ led with my sister , and I have prev@@ ailed : and she called his name Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
when Le@@ ah saw that she had left bearing , she took Zil@@ p@@ ah her ma@@ id , and gave her Jac@@ o@@ b to wife .
and Le@@ ah said , God hat@@ h given me my h@@ ire , because I have given my ma@@ iden to my husband : and she called his name Is@@ sac@@ har .
and she conce@@ ived , and b@@ are a son ; and said , God hat@@ h taken away my re@@ pro@@ ach :
and it came to pass , when R@@ ach@@ el had born Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to Lab@@ an , S@@ end me away , that I may go un@@ to mine own place , and to my country .
give me my wi@@ ves and my children , for whom I have served the@@ e , and let me go : for th@@ ou know@@ est my service which I have done the@@ e .
and Lab@@ an said un@@ to him , I pra@@ y the@@ e , if I have found favour in th@@ ine eyes , tar@@ ry : for I have learned by experience that the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed me for TH@@ Y sake .
and he said , appoint me TH@@ Y wages , and I will give it .
and he set three days ' journey bet@@ wi@@ xt himself and Jac@@ o@@ b : and Jac@@ o@@ b f@@ ed the rest of Lab@@ an 's f@@ loc@@ ks .
and he set the ro@@ ds which he had pil@@ led before the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering t@@ rough@@ s when the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink , that they should conce@@ ive when they came to drink .
and the f@@ loc@@ ks conce@@ ived before the ro@@ ds , and brought forth c@@ attle r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and spot@@ ted .
and it came to pass , wh@@ en@@ so@@ ever the stronger c@@ attle did conce@@ ive , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the c@@ attle in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds .
but when the c@@ attle were fe@@ e@@ ble , he put them not in : so the fe@@ eb@@ ler were Lab@@ an 's , and the stronger Jac@@ o@@ b 's .
and Jac@@ o@@ b be@@ held the coun@@ tenance of Lab@@ an , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
and said un@@ to them , I see your father 's coun@@ tenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hat@@ h been with me .
and ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
if he said thus , The spec@@ k@@ led shall be TH@@ Y wages ; then all the c@@ attle b@@ are spec@@ k@@ led : and if he said thus , The r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked shall be TH@@ Y h@@ ire ; then b@@ are all the c@@ attle r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked .
thus God hat@@ h taken away the c@@ attle of your father , and given them to me .
and the an@@ gel of God sp@@ ake un@@ to me in a dream , saying , Jac@@ o@@ b : and I said , H@@ ere am I@@ .
and he said , L@@ if@@ t up now th@@ ine eyes , and see , all the r@@ ams which le@@ ap upon the c@@ attle are r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led : for I have seen all that Lab@@ an do@@ eth un@@ to the@@ e .
for all the ri@@ ches which God hat@@ h taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever God hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , do .
then Jac@@ o@@ b rose up , and set his sons and his wi@@ ves upon ca@@ me@@ ls ;
and Lab@@ an went to s@@ hear his she@@ ep : and R@@ ach@@ el had stolen the images that were her father 's .
and Jac@@ o@@ b st@@ ole away un@@ awar@@ es to Lab@@ an the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and he took his bre@@ th@@ ren with him , and pursu@@ ed after him seven days ' journey ; and they over@@ took him in the mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
then Lab@@ an over@@ took Jac@@ o@@ b . now Jac@@ o@@ b had pit@@ ched his tent in the mount : and Lab@@ an with his bre@@ th@@ ren pit@@ ched in the mount of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and Lab@@ an said to Jac@@ o@@ b , What h@@ ast th@@ ou done , that th@@ ou h@@ ast stolen away un@@ awar@@ es to me , and carried away my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , as cap@@ tives taken with the s@@ word ?
and h@@ ast not suffered me to k@@ is@@ s my sons and my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ? th@@ ou h@@ ast now done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly in so doing .
and now , though th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest needs be gone , because th@@ ou sor@@ e long@@ ed@@ st after TH@@ Y father 's house , yet where@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou stolen my go@@ ds ?
and Jac@@ o@@ b answ@@ ered and said to Lab@@ an , Bec@@ ause I was afraid : for I said , Per@@ ad@@ venture th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest take by force TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters from me .
and Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two ma@@ id@@ servants ' ten@@ ts ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now R@@ ach@@ el had taken the images , and put them in the C@@ ame@@ l 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Lab@@ an searched all the tent , but found them not .
and Jac@@ o@@ b was wro@@ th , and cho@@ de with Lab@@ an : and Jac@@ o@@ b answ@@ ered and said to Lab@@ an , What is my t@@ res@@ pass ? what is my sin , that th@@ ou h@@ ast so ho@@ tly pursu@@ ed after me ?
whereas th@@ ou h@@ ast searched all my stu@@ ff , what h@@ ast th@@ ou found of all TH@@ Y household stu@@ ff ? set it here before my bre@@ th@@ ren and TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , that they may judge bet@@ wi@@ xt us both .
this twenty years have I been with the@@ e ; TH@@ Y e@@ w@@ es and TH@@ Y she go@@ ats have not cast their young , and the r@@ ams of TH@@ Y flock have I not e@@ aten .
that which was torn of be@@ asts I brought not un@@ to the@@ e ; I b@@ are the loss of it ; of my hand di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consu@@ med me , and the F@@ ro@@ st by night ; and my sle@@ ep depar@@ ted from mine eyes .
thus have I been twenty years in TH@@ Y house ; I served the@@ e fo@@ ur@@ teen years for TH@@ Y two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and six years for TH@@ Y c@@ attle : and th@@ ou h@@ ast changed my wages ten times .
now therefore come th@@ ou , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , I and th@@ ou ; and let it be for a witness between me and the@@ e .
and Lab@@ an called it J@@ eg@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ sah@@ ad@@ u@@ th@@ a : but Jac@@ o@@ b called it Gal@@ e@@ ed .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt aff@@ lic@@ t my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , or if th@@ ou s@@ halt take other wi@@ ves bes@@ ide my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness bet@@ wi@@ xt me and the@@ e .
and Lab@@ an said to Jac@@ o@@ b , be@@ hold this he@@ ap , and be@@ hold this pil@@ lar , which I have cast bet@@ wi@@ xt me and the@@ e ;
this he@@ ap be witness , and this pil@@ lar be witness , that I will not pass over this he@@ ap to the@@ e , and that th@@ ou s@@ halt not pass over this he@@ ap and this pil@@ lar un@@ to me , for harm .
the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of N@@ ah@@ or , the God of their father , judge bet@@ wi@@ xt us . and Jac@@ o@@ b sw@@ are by the fear of his father I@@ sa@@ ac .
then Jac@@ o@@ b offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his bre@@ th@@ ren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tar@@ ried all night in the mount .
and when Jac@@ o@@ b saw them , he said , This is God 's host : and he called the name of that place Mah@@ an@@ aim .
and Jac@@ o@@ b sent mes@@ sen@@ gers before him to E@@ sa@@ u his brother un@@ to the land of Se@@ ir , the country of E@@ dom .
and I have ox@@ en , and ass@@ es , f@@ loc@@ ks , and men@@ servants , and w@@ om@@ en@@ servants : and I have sent to tell my lor@@ d , that I may find grace in TH@@ Y sight .
then Jac@@ o@@ b was greatly afraid and dist@@ ressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the f@@ loc@@ ks , and her@@ ds , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , into two bands ;
and said , If E@@ sa@@ u come to the one company , and sm@@ ite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
and Jac@@ o@@ b said , O God of my father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and God of my father I@@ sa@@ ac , the Lord which sa@@ id@@ st un@@ to me , Ret@@ ur@@ n un@@ to TH@@ Y country , and to TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ red , and I will deal well with the@@ e :
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the mer@@ cies , and of all the truth , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I will su@@ rely do the@@ e good , and make TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the s@@ and of the sea , which can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every dro@@ ve by themselves ; and said un@@ to his servants , Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ xt dro@@ ve and dro@@ ve .
and he comman@@ ded the fore@@ most , saying , When E@@ sa@@ u my brother me@@ ete@@ th the@@ e , and ask@@ eth the@@ e , saying , whose art th@@ ou ? and w@@ hi@@ ther go@@ est th@@ ou ? and whose are these before the@@ e ?
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say , They be TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b 's ; it is a present sent un@@ to my lor@@ d E@@ sa@@ u : and , be@@ hold , also he is behind us .
and so comman@@ ded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the dro@@ ves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak un@@ to E@@ sa@@ u , when ye find him .
so went the present over before him : and himself lo@@ d@@ ged that night in the company .
and he took them , and sent them over the Bro@@ ok , and sent over that he had .
and Jac@@ o@@ b was left alone ; and there wrest@@ led a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prev@@ ailed not against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh ; and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
and he said , Th@@ y name shall be called no more Jac@@ o@@ b , but Israel : for as a pr@@ ince h@@ ast th@@ ou power with God and with men , and h@@ ast prev@@ ailed .
and Jac@@ o@@ b asked him , and said , T@@ ell me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y name . and he said , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore is it that th@@ ou dost ask after my name ? and he b@@ les@@ sed him there .
and Jac@@ o@@ b called the name of the place Pen@@ i@@ el : for I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved .
and as he passed over Pen@@ uel the sun rose upon him , and he halted upon his th@@ igh .
and he put the hand@@ ma@@ ids and their children fore@@ most , and Le@@ ah and her children after , and R@@ ach@@ el and Joseph hin@@ der@@ most .
and he passed over before them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and E@@ sa@@ u ran to meet him , and embrac@@ ed him , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him : and they we@@ pt .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , Wh@@ o are those with the@@ e ? and he said , The children which God hat@@ h gr@@ ac@@ iously given TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
then the hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s came near , they and their children , and they bo@@ wed themselves .
and Le@@ ah also with her children came near , and bo@@ wed themselves : and after came Joseph near and R@@ ach@@ el , and they bo@@ wed themselves .
and Jac@@ o@@ b jour@@ ne@@ yed to Suc@@ co@@ th , and built him an house , and made bo@@ o@@ ths for his c@@ attle : therefore the name of the place is called Suc@@ co@@ th .
and Jac@@ o@@ b came to S@@ hal@@ em , a city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am ; and pit@@ ched his tent before the city .
and Din@@ ah the daughter of Le@@ ah , which she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , went out to see the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the land .
and when Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , pr@@ ince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and def@@ iled her .
and Jac@@ o@@ b heard that he had def@@ iled Din@@ ah his daughter : now his sons were with his c@@ attle in the field : and Jac@@ o@@ b held his peace until they were come .
and Ham@@ or commun@@ ed with them , saying , The sou@@ l of my son Sh@@ ec@@ hem lon@@ get@@ h for your daughter : I pra@@ y you give her him to wife .
and make ye marri@@ ages with us , and give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to us , and take our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to you .
and ye shall d@@ well with us : and the land shall be before you ; d@@ well and trade ye there@@ in , and get you pos@@ sessions there@@ in .
and Sh@@ ec@@ hem said un@@ to her father and un@@ to her bre@@ th@@ ren , Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say un@@ to me I will give .
and the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b answ@@ ered Sh@@ ec@@ hem and Ham@@ or his father dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully , and said , because he had def@@ iled Din@@ ah their sister :
and they said un@@ to them , We can@@ not do this thing , to give our sister to one that is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ; for that were a re@@ pro@@ ach un@@ to us :
but in this will we consent un@@ to you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circum@@ c@@ ised ;
but if ye will not he@@ arken un@@ to us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man def@@ er@@ red not to do the thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter : and he was more honour@@ able than all the house of his father .
and Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son came un@@ to the gate of their city , and commun@@ ed with the men of their city , saying ,
only her@@ e@@ in will the men consent un@@ to us for to d@@ well with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
and they sle@@ w Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went out .
the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b came upon the sla@@ in , and sp@@ o@@ iled the city , because they had def@@ iled their sister .
they took their she@@ ep , and their ox@@ en , and their ass@@ es , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wi@@ ves took they cap@@ tive , and sp@@ o@@ iled even all that was in the house .
then Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to his household , and to all that were with him , P@@ ut away the st@@ range go@@ ds that are among you , and be clean , and change your gar@@ ments :
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an alt@@ ar un@@ to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b all the st@@ range go@@ ds which were in their hand , and all their ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that is , Be@@ the@@ l , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an alt@@ ar , and called the place El @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ el : because there God appeared un@@ to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
but De@@ bor@@ ah Re@@ bek@@ ah 's nur@@ se died , and she was buried ben@@ e@@ ath Be@@ the@@ l under an o@@ ak : and the name of it was called Al@@ lon @@@ -@@ @ bac@@ h@@ ut@@ h .
and God appeared un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b again , when he came out of P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , and b@@ les@@ sed him .
and God said un@@ to him , Th@@ y name is Jac@@ o@@ b : TH@@ Y name shall not be called any more Jac@@ o@@ b , but Israel shall be TH@@ Y name : and he called his name Israel .
and God said un@@ to him , I am God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty : be fruit@@ ful and multi@@ ply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of the@@ e , and kings shall come out of TH@@ Y lo@@ ins ;
and the land which I gave Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac , to the@@ e I will give it , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e will I give the land .
and Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he talked with him , even a pil@@ lar of stone : and he p@@ oured a drink offering there@@ on , and he p@@ oured oil there@@ on .
and Jac@@ o@@ b called the name of the place where God sp@@ ake with him , Be@@ the@@ l .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from Be@@ the@@ l ; and there was but a little way to come to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath : and R@@ ach@@ el trav@@ ailed , and she had hard labour .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the mid@@ wife said un@@ to her , Fe@@ ar not ; th@@ ou s@@ halt have this son also .
and it came to pass , as her sou@@ l was in depar@@ ting , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben @@@ -@@ @ oni : but his father called him Benjamin .
and Jac@@ o@@ b set a pil@@ lar upon her grave : that is the pil@@ lar of R@@ ach@@ el 's grave un@@ to this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel d@@ wel@@ t in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b were twelve :
and the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , Le@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id ; G@@ ad , and As@@ her : these are the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , which were born to him in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am .
and the days of I@@ sa@@ ac were an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score years .
and I@@ sa@@ ac gave up the gh@@ ost , and died , and was gathered un@@ to his people , being old and full of days : and his sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jac@@ o@@ b buried him .
now these are the generations of E@@ sa@@ u , who is E@@ dom .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an ; A@@ da@@ h the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te , and Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on the H@@ iv@@ ite ;
and Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah b@@ are Je@@ ush , and Ja@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah : these are the sons of E@@ sa@@ u , which were born un@@ to him in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
for their ri@@ ches were more than that they might d@@ well together ; and the land where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers could not bear them because of their c@@ attle .
and these are the generations of E@@ sa@@ u the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites in mount Se@@ ir :
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons ; Eli@@ p@@ haz the son of A@@ da@@ h the wife of E@@ sa@@ u , Re@@ uel the son of B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .

and these are the kings that re@@ ig@@ ned in the land of E@@ dom , before there re@@ ig@@ ned any king over the children of Israel .
and Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or re@@ ig@@ ned in E@@ dom : and the name of his city was Din@@ ha@@ bah .

Duk@@ e Mag@@ di@@ el , Duk@@ e Ira@@ m : these be the duk@@ es of E@@ dom , according to their habi@@ tations in the land of their possession : he is E@@ sa@@ u the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites .
and Jac@@ o@@ b d@@ wel@@ t in the land where@@ in his father was a st@@ ran@@ ger , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
now Israel lov@@ ed Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs .
and when his bre@@ th@@ ren saw that their father lov@@ ed him more than all his bre@@ th@@ ren , they ha@@ ted him , and could not speak peac@@ e@@ ably un@@ to him .
and Joseph dre@@ amed a dream , and he told it his bre@@ th@@ ren : and they ha@@ ted him yet the more .
and he dre@@ amed yet another dream , and told it his bre@@ th@@ ren , and said , be@@ hold , I have dre@@ amed a dream more ; and , be@@ hold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obe@@ is@@ ance to me .
and a certain man found him , and , be@@ hold , he was w@@ and@@ ering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seek@@ est th@@ ou ?
and when they saw him af@@ ar off , even before he came near un@@ to them , they consp@@ ired against him to s@@ lay him .
come now therefore , and let us s@@ lay him , and cast him into some p@@ it , and we will say , Some ev@@ il be@@ ast hat@@ h dev@@ oured him : and we shall see what will become of his dre@@ ams .
and Re@@ ub@@ en heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his co@@ at , his co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a p@@ it : and the p@@ it was empty , there was no water in it .
come , and let us sell him to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our f@@ les@@ h . and his bre@@ th@@ ren were content .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Re@@ ub@@ en returned un@@ to the p@@ it ; and , be@@ hold , Joseph was not in the p@@ it ; and he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and they took Joseph 's co@@ at , and killed a k@@ id of the go@@ ats , and di@@ pped the co@@ at in the blood ;
and they sent the co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be TH@@ Y son 's co@@ at or no .
and Ju@@ da@@ h saw there a daughter of a certain Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , whose name was Sh@@ u@@ ah ; and he took her , and went in un@@ to her .
and she yet again conce@@ ived , and b@@ are a son ; and called his name She@@ lah : and he was at C@@ he@@ zi@@ b , when she b@@ are him .
and E@@ R , Ju@@ da@@ h 's fir@@ st@@ born , was w@@ ic@@ ked in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord sle@@ w him .
and it was told Tam@@ ar , saying , be@@ hold TH@@ Y father in law go@@ eth up to Tim@@ n@@ ath to s@@ hear his she@@ ep .
when Ju@@ da@@ h saw her , he thought her to be an har@@ lot ; because she had covered her face .
and she ar@@ ose , and went away , and laid by her v@@ ail from her , and put on the gar@@ ments of her wi@@ do@@ who@@ od .
and Ju@@ da@@ h sent the k@@ id by the hand of his friend the Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , to receive his pledge from the woman 's hand : but he found her not .
and it came to pass in the time of her trav@@ ail , that , be@@ hold , tw@@ ins were in her w@@ om@@ b .
and it came to pass , when she trav@@ ailed , that the one put out his hand : and the mid@@ wife took and bound upon his hand a scar@@ let thre@@ ad , saying , This came out first ,
and after@@ ward came out his brother , that had the scar@@ let thre@@ ad upon his hand : and his name was called Zar@@ ah .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , which had brought him down th@@ ither .
and the Lord was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and his master saw that the Lord was with him , and that the Lord made all that he did to prosp@@ er in his hand .
and Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him over@@ se@@ er over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Li@@ e with me .
and it came to pass , as she sp@@ ake to Joseph day by day , that he hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and she caught him by his gar@@ ment , saying , Li@@ e with me : and he left his gar@@ ment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his gar@@ ment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she laid up his gar@@ ment by her , until his lor@@ d came home .
and she sp@@ ake un@@ to him according to these words , saying , The H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ser@@ vant , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought un@@ to us , came in un@@ to me to mo@@ ck me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , After this manner did TH@@ Y ser@@ vant to me ; that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
but the Lord was with Joseph , and she@@ wed him mer@@ cy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keep@@ er of the prison .
and the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they did there , he was the do@@ er of it .
the keep@@ er of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the Lord was with him , and that which he did , the Lord made it to prosp@@ er .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er had off@@ ended their lor@@ d the king of Egypt .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was wro@@ th against two of his officers , against the chief of the but@@ lers , and against the chief of the Bak@@ ers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and Joseph came in un@@ to them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , be@@ hold , they were sad .
and he asked P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's officers that were with him in the ward of his lor@@ d 's house , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore look ye so sad@@ ly to day ?
and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , be@@ hold , a v@@ ine was before me ;
and in the v@@ ine were three branches : and it was as though it bud@@ ded , and her b@@ los@@ s@@ oms shot forth ; and the clu@@ sters there@@ of brought forth ri@@ pe grap@@ es :
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand : and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up th@@ ine head , and restore the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y place : and th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , after the former manner when th@@ ou w@@ ast his Butler .
but think on me when it shall be well with the@@ e , and she@@ w kin@@ d@@ ness , I pra@@ y the@@ e , un@@ to me , and make mention of me un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on .
when the chief Bak@@ er saw that the interpre@@ tation was good , he said un@@ to Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , be@@ hold , I had three white bas@@ kets on my head :
and in the up@@ per@@ most bas@@ ket there was of all manner of bak@@ eme@@ ats for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; and the birds did eat them out of the bas@@ ket upon my head .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up TH@@ Y head from off the@@ e , and shall han@@ g the@@ e on a tree ; and the birds shall eat TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h from off the@@ e .
and it came to pass the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast un@@ to all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h dre@@ amed : and , be@@ hold , he stood by the river .
and , be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured k@@ ine and fat@@ fle@@ shed ; and they f@@ ed in a Me@@ ad@@ ow .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed ; and stood by the other k@@ ine upon the br@@ ink of the river .
and the ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed k@@ ine did eat up the seven well favoured and f@@ at k@@ ine . so P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h aw@@ oke .
and he sle@@ pt and dre@@ amed the second time : and , be@@ hold , seven e@@ ars of cor@@ n came up upon one stal@@ k , rank and good .
and , be@@ hold , seven th@@ in e@@ ars and b@@ lasted with the east wind sp@@ run@@ g up after them .
and the seven th@@ in e@@ ars dev@@ oured the seven rank and full e@@ ars . and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h aw@@ oke , and , be@@ hold , it was a dream .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was wro@@ th with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard 's house , both me and the chief Bak@@ er :
and we dre@@ amed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dre@@ amed each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored un@@ to mine office , and him he han@@ ged .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent and called Joseph , and they brought him has@@ ti@@ ly out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and he sha@@ ved himself , and changed his ra@@ im@@ ent , and came in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , In my dream , be@@ hold , I stood upon the bank of the river :
and , be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven k@@ ine , fat@@ fle@@ shed and well favoured ; and they f@@ ed in a Me@@ ad@@ ow :
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for bad@@ ness :
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it could not be known that they had e@@ aten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
and I saw in my dream , and , be@@ hold , seven e@@ ars came up in one stal@@ k , full and good :
and , be@@ hold , seven e@@ ars , with@@ ered , th@@ in , and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them :
and the th@@ in e@@ ars dev@@ oured the seven good e@@ ars : and I told this un@@ to the mag@@ ic@@ ians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and the seven th@@ in and ill favoured k@@ ine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty e@@ ars b@@ lasted with the east wind shall be seven years of fam@@ ine .
this is the thing which I have spoken un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : what God is about to do he she@@ w@@ eth un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
be@@ hold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt :
and there shall arise after them seven years of fam@@ ine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the fam@@ ine shall consum@@ e the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that fam@@ ine following ; for it shall be very gri@@ ev@@ ous .
and for that the dream was doubled un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up cor@@ n under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land per@@ ish not through the fam@@ ine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spiri@@ t of God is ?
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be over my house , and according un@@ to TH@@ Y word shall all my people be ruled : only in the th@@ r@@ one will I be greater than th@@ ou .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , Se@@ e , I have set the@@ e over all the land of Egypt .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in ves@@ tures of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ;
and he made him to ride in the second char@@ i@@ ot which he had ; and they cri@@ ed before him , bo@@ w the k@@ ne@@ e : and he made him ru@@ ler over all the land of Egypt .
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and Joseph gathered cor@@ n as the s@@ and of the sea , very much , until he left num@@ ber@@ ing ; for it was without number .
and un@@ to Joseph were born two sons before the years of fam@@ ine came , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Po@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah pri@@ est of On b@@ are un@@ to him .
and Joseph called the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : for God , said he , hat@@ h made me forget all my to@@ il , and all my father 's house .
and the name of the second called he E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for God hat@@ h caused me to be fruit@@ ful in the land of my aff@@ li@@ ction .
and the seven years of plen@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of de@@ ar@@ th began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the de@@ ar@@ th was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and when all the land of Egypt was fam@@ ished , the people cri@@ ed to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h for bread : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , G@@ o un@@ to Joseph ; what he sa@@ ith to you , do .
and the fam@@ ine was over all the face of the ear@@ th : and Joseph opened all the sto@@ re@@ houses , and sold un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and the fam@@ ine wa@@ xed sor@@ e in the land of Egypt .
now when Jac@@ o@@ b saw that there was cor@@ n in Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to his sons , Wh@@ y do ye look one upon another ?
and he said , be@@ hold , I have heard that there is cor@@ n in Egypt : get you down th@@ ither , and buy for us from th@@ ence ; that we may live , and not die .
but Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , Jac@@ o@@ b sent not with his bre@@ th@@ ren ; for he said , L@@ est per@@ ad@@ venture mis@@ chief be@@ fall him .
and the sons of Israel came to buy cor@@ n among those that came : for the fam@@ ine was in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and Joseph remember@@ ed the dre@@ ams which he dre@@ amed of them , and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are sp@@ ies ; to see the nak@@ edn@@ ess of the land ye are come .
Her@@ e@@ by ye shall be proved : by the life of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hi@@ ther .
if ye be true men , let one of your bre@@ th@@ ren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry cor@@ n for the fam@@ ine of your houses :
and Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered them , saying , Sp@@ ake I not un@@ to you , saying , D@@ o not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , be@@ hold , also his blood is required .
and they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he sp@@ ake un@@ to them by an interpre@@ ter .
and he turned himself about from them , and we@@ pt ; and returned to them again , and commun@@ ed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph comman@@ ded to fill their s@@ acks with cor@@ n , and to restore every man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he un@@ to them .
and they la@@ ded their ass@@ es with the cor@@ n , and depar@@ ted th@@ ence .
and as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the In@@ n , he es@@ p@@ ied his money ; for , be@@ hold , it was in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
and they came un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b their father un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and told him all that be@@ fell un@@ to them ; saying ,
the man , who is the lor@@ d of the land , sp@@ ake roughly to us , and took us for sp@@ ies of the country .
we be twelve bre@@ th@@ ren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
and Re@@ ub@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to his father , saying , S@@ lay my two sons , if I bring him not to the@@ e : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to the@@ e again .
if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t send our brother with us , we will go down and buy the@@ e food :
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not send him , we will not go down : for the man said un@@ to us , Y@@ e shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the m@@ outh of your s@@ acks , carry it again in your hand ; per@@ ad@@ venture it was an over@@ sight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ru@@ ler of his house , Br@@ ing these men home , and s@@ lay , and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon .
and the man did as Joseph b@@ ade ; and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house .
and they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they commun@@ ed with him at the door of the house ,
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we can@@ not tell who put our money in our s@@ acks .
and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they was@@ hed their feet ; and he gave their ass@@ es pro@@ ven@@ der .
and they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bo@@ wed themselves to him to the ear@@ th .
and Joseph made has@@ te ; for his bo@@ wel@@ s did ye@@ ar@@ n upon his brother : and he sought where to we@@ ep ; and he entered into his chamber , and we@@ pt there .
and they sat before him , the fir@@ st@@ born according to his birth@@ right , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men mar@@ v@@ elled one at another .
and he took and sent mes@@ ses un@@ to them from before him : but Benjamin 's mes@@ s was five times so much as any of the@@ ir@@ s . and they d@@ rank , and were mer@@ ry with him .
and put my c@@ up , the silver c@@ up , in the s@@ ack 's m@@ outh of the youngest , and his cor@@ n money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their ass@@ es .
and he over@@ took them , and he sp@@ ake un@@ to them these same words .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again un@@ to the@@ e out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we ste@@ al out of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house silver or gold ?
with wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever of TH@@ Y servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lor@@ d 's bon@@ d@@ men .
and he searched , and began at the el@@ dest , and left at the youngest : and the c@@ up was found in Benjamin 's s@@ ack .
then they rent their clo@@ th@@ es , and la@@ ded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
and Ju@@ da@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren came to Joseph 's house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and he said , God for@@ bid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the c@@ up is found , he shall be my ser@@ vant ; and as for you , get you up in peace un@@ to your father .
and we said un@@ to my lor@@ d , The la@@ d can@@ not leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
and it came to pass when we came up un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant my father , we told him the words of my lor@@ d .
and the one went out from me , and I said , su@@ rely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
and if ye take this also from me , and mis@@ chief be@@ fall him , ye shall bring down my gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s with sor@@ row to the grave .
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant became su@@ re@@ ty for the la@@ d un@@ to my father , saying , If I bring him not un@@ to the@@ e , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant abide instead of the la@@ d a bon@@ d@@ man to my lor@@ d ; and let the la@@ d go up with his bre@@ th@@ ren .
for how shall I go up to my father , and the la@@ d be not with me ? lest per@@ ad@@ venture I see the ev@@ il that shall come on my father .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cri@@ ed , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and Joseph said un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , I am Joseph ; do@@ th my father yet live ? and his bre@@ th@@ ren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
and Joseph said un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , C@@ ome near to me , I pra@@ y you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
now therefore be not gri@@ ev@@ ed , nor angry with yo@@ ur@@ selves , that ye sold me hi@@ ther : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hat@@ h the fam@@ ine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be ear@@ ing nor har@@ v@@ est .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a poster@@ ity in the ear@@ th , and to save your lives by a great deliver@@ ance .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hat@@ h made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lor@@ d of all his house , and a ru@@ ler throughout all the land of Egypt .
has@@ te ye , and go up to my father , and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith TH@@ Y son Joseph , God hat@@ h made me lor@@ d of all Egypt : come down un@@ to me , tar@@ ry not :
and there will I no@@ ur@@ ish the@@ e ; for yet there are five years of fam@@ ine ; lest th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y household , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast , come to poverty .
and , be@@ hold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my m@@ outh that speak@@ eth un@@ to you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my gl@@ ory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall has@@ te and bring down my father hi@@ ther .
and he fell upon his brother Benjamin 's nec@@ k , and we@@ pt ; and Benjamin we@@ pt upon his nec@@ k .
moreover he k@@ is@@ sed all his bre@@ th@@ ren , and we@@ pt upon them : and after that his bre@@ th@@ ren talked with him .
and the f@@ ame there@@ of was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren are come : and it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , S@@ ay un@@ to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , This do ye ; la@@ de your be@@ asts , and go , get you un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
and take your father and your households , and come un@@ to me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the f@@ at of the land .
now th@@ ou art comman@@ ded , this do ye ; take you w@@ ag@@ ons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wi@@ ves , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them w@@ ag@@ ons , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of ra@@ im@@ ent ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of ra@@ im@@ ent .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten ass@@ es la@@ den with the good things of Egypt , and ten she ass@@ es la@@ den with cor@@ n and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his bre@@ th@@ ren away , and they depar@@ ted : and he said un@@ to them , Se@@ e that ye fall not out by the way .
and they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Can@@ a@@ an un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b their father ,
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said un@@ to them : and when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b their father revi@@ ved :
and Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , and offered sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es un@@ to the God of his father I@@ sa@@ ac .
and he said , I am God , the God of TH@@ Y father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of the@@ e a great nation :
I will go down with the@@ e into Egypt ; and I will also su@@ rely bring the@@ e up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon th@@ ine eyes .
and they took their c@@ attle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b , and all his se@@ ed with him :
and these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b and his sons : Re@@ ub@@ en , Jac@@ o@@ b 's fir@@ st@@ born .
and the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en ; Han@@ o@@ ch , and P@@ hal@@ lu , and H@@ ez@@ ron , and Car@@ mi .
and the sons of Simeon ; J@@ em@@ uel , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman .
these be the sons of Le@@ ah , which she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , with his daughter Din@@ ah : all the so@@ ul@@ s of his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were thirty and three .
these are the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah his daughter , and these she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , even six@@ teen so@@ ul@@ s .
and un@@ to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Po@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah pri@@ est of On b@@ are un@@ to him .
these are the sons of R@@ ach@@ el , which were born to Jac@@ o@@ b : all the so@@ ul@@ s were fo@@ ur@@ teen .
and the sons of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i ; Jah@@ z@@ e@@ el , and Gun@@ i , and J@@ ez@@ er , and Sh@@ il@@ lem .
these are the sons of Bil@@ ha@@ h , which Lab@@ an gave un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el his daughter , and she b@@ are these un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b : all the so@@ ul@@ s were seven .
all the so@@ ul@@ s that came with Jac@@ o@@ b into Egypt , which came out of his lo@@ ins , besides Jac@@ o@@ b 's sons ' wi@@ ves , all the so@@ ul@@ s were thre@@ es@@ core and six ;
and he sent Ju@@ da@@ h before him un@@ to Joseph , to direct his face un@@ to Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they came into the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and Joseph made ready his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ h@@ en , and presented himself un@@ to him ; and he fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
and the men are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , for their trade hat@@ h been to fe@@ ed c@@ attle ; and they have brought their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall call you , and shall say , What is your occupation ?
and he took some of his bre@@ th@@ ren , even five men , and presented them un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and Joseph brought in Jac@@ o@@ b his father , and set him before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : and Jac@@ o@@ b b@@ les@@ sed P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and Jac@@ o@@ b b@@ les@@ sed P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went out from before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and Joseph placed his father and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
and Joseph no@@ ur@@ ished his father , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very sor@@ e , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the cor@@ n which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end there@@ of .
then Joseph said un@@ to the people , be@@ hold , I have bought you this day and your land for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : lo , here is se@@ ed for you , and ye shall so@@ w the land .
and they said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast sav@@ ed our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lor@@ d , and we will be P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt un@@ to this day , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h should have the fifth part ; except the land of the pri@@ ests only , which became not P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's .
and Israel d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt , in the country of Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they had pos@@ sessions there@@ in , and grew , and multi@@ p@@ lied exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
and Jac@@ o@@ b lived in the land of Egypt se@@ ven@@ teen years : so the whole age of Jac@@ o@@ b was an hundred for@@ ty and seven years .
but I will lie with my fa@@ thers , and th@@ ou s@@ halt carry me out of Egypt , and bur@@ y me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y father is si@@ ck : and he took with him his two sons , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and one told Jac@@ o@@ b , and said , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y son Joseph co@@ me@@ th un@@ to the@@ e : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and said un@@ to me , be@@ hold , I will make the@@ e fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply the@@ e , and I will make of the@@ e a multi@@ tude of people ; and will give this land to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e for an ever@@ lasting possession .
and now TH@@ Y two sons , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which were born un@@ to the@@ e in the land of Egypt before I came un@@ to the@@ e into Egypt , are mine ; as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and TH@@ Y issue , which th@@ ou beg@@ et@@ test after them , shall be th@@ ine , and shall be called after the name of their bre@@ th@@ ren in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
and Joseph said un@@ to his father , They are my sons , whom God hat@@ h given me in this place . and he said , Br@@ ing them , I pra@@ y the@@ e , un@@ to me , and I will b@@ less them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his k@@ ne@@ es , and he bo@@ wed himself with his face to the ear@@ th .
and Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near un@@ to him .
and he b@@ les@@ sed Joseph , and said , God , before whom my fa@@ thers Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac did walk , the God which f@@ ed me all my life long un@@ to this day ,
moreover I have given to the@@ e one portion above TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , which I took out of the hand of the Am@@ or@@ ite with my s@@ word and with my bo@@ w .
and Jac@@ o@@ b called un@@ to his sons , and said , G@@ ather yo@@ ur@@ selves together , that I may tell you that which shall be@@ fall you in the last days .
gather yo@@ ur@@ selves together , and hear , ye sons of Jac@@ o@@ b ; and he@@ arken un@@ to Israel your father .
Re@@ ub@@ en , th@@ ou art my fir@@ st@@ born , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of dignity , and the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of power :
unstable as water , th@@ ou s@@ halt not exc@@ el ; because th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test up to TH@@ Y father 's bed ; then def@@ il@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou it : he went up to my cou@@ ch .
O my sou@@ l , come not th@@ ou into their secret ; un@@ to their assembly , mine honour , be not th@@ ou united : for in their an@@ ger they sle@@ w a man , and in their sel@@ f@@ will they dig@@ ged down a wall .
Cur@@ sed be their an@@ ger , for it was fierce ; and their wr@@ ath , for it was cru@@ el : I will divide them in Jac@@ o@@ b , and sc@@ at@@ ter them in Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h , th@@ ou art he whom TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren shall praise : TH@@ Y hand shall be in the nec@@ k of th@@ ine enem@@ ies ; TH@@ Y father 's children shall bo@@ w down before the@@ e .
the scep@@ tre shall not de@@ part from Ju@@ da@@ h , nor a law@@ gi@@ ver from between his feet , until Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h come ; and un@@ to him shall the gathering of the people be .
Ze@@ bul@@ un shall d@@ well at the ha@@ ven of the sea ; and he shall be for an ha@@ ven of ships ; and his border shall be un@@ to Z@@ id@@ on .
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleas@@ ant ; and bo@@ wed his sho@@ ul@@ der to bear , and became a ser@@ vant un@@ to tri@@ bute .
Dan shall be a ser@@ p@@ ent by the way , an ad@@ der in the path , that bi@@ te@@ th the hor@@ se he@@ els , so that his Ri@@ der shall fall back@@ ward .
the ar@@ chers have so@@ rely gri@@ ev@@ ed him , and shot at him , and ha@@ ted him :
but his bo@@ w abo@@ de in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty God of Jac@@ o@@ b ; ( from th@@ ence is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel : )
Benjamin shall rav@@ in as a w@@ ol@@ f : in the morning he shall dev@@ our the pre@@ y , and at night he shall divide the sp@@ oil .
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : and this is it that their father sp@@ ake un@@ to them , and b@@ les@@ sed them ; every one according to his b@@ les@@ sing he b@@ les@@ sed them .
there they buried Ab@@ ra@@ ham and Sar@@ ah his wife ; there they buried I@@ sa@@ ac and Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife ; and there I buried Le@@ ah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is there@@ in was from the children of H@@ eth .
and when Jac@@ o@@ b had made an end of comman@@ ding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost , and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and Joseph fell upon his father 's face , and we@@ pt upon him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and for@@ ty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are em@@ bal@@ med : and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans mour@@ ned for him thre@@ es@@ core and ten days .
and Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father : and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , and all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
and there went up with him both char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men : and it was a very great company .
and they came to the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of A@@ ta@@ d , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mour@@ ned with a great and very sor@@ e lament@@ ation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place of E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that went up with him to bur@@ y his father , after he had buried his father .
and his bre@@ th@@ ren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , be@@ hold , we be TH@@ Y servants .
but as for you , ye thought ev@@ il against me ; but God meant it un@@ to good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : I will no@@ ur@@ ish you , and your little ones . and he comfor@@ ted them , and sp@@ ake kin@@ dly un@@ to them .
and Joseph d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt , he , and his father 's house : and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years .
and Joseph saw E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's children of the third generation : the children also of Mac@@ hir the son Man@@ as@@ se@@ h were brought up upon Joseph 's k@@ ne@@ es .
so Joseph died , being an hundred and ten years old : and they em@@ bal@@ med him , and he was put in a co@@ ff@@ in in Egypt .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jac@@ o@@ b .
and all the so@@ ul@@ s that came out of the lo@@ ins of Jac@@ o@@ b were sev@@ enty so@@ ul@@ s : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
and the children of Israel were fruit@@ ful , and increased ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and multi@@ p@@ lied , and wa@@ xed exceeding m@@ igh@@ ty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they aff@@ lic@@ ted them , the more they multi@@ p@@ lied and grew . and they were gri@@ ev@@ ed because of the children of Israel .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans made the children of Israel to serve with ri@@ g@@ our :
and the king of Egypt sp@@ ake to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of which the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah :
but the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves fear@@ ed God , and did not as the king of Egypt comman@@ ded them , but sav@@ ed the men children alive .
and the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves said un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Bec@@ ause the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are li@@ vely , and are delivered ER@@ E the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves come in un@@ to them .
therefore God dealt well with the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves : and the people multi@@ p@@ lied , and wa@@ xed very m@@ igh@@ ty .
and it came to pass , because the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves fear@@ ed God , that he made them houses .
and there went a man of the house of L@@ evi , and took to wife a daughter of L@@ evi .
and the woman conce@@ ived , and b@@ are a son : and when she saw him that he was a good@@ ly child , she hi@@ d him three months .
and his sister stood af@@ ar off , to w@@ it what would be done to him .
and the daughter of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h came down to was@@ h her@@ self at the river ; and her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ar@@ k among the flags , she sent her ma@@ id to f@@ et@@ ch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , be@@ hold , the bab@@ e we@@ pt . and she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children .
and the child grew , and she brought him un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter , and he became her son . and she called his name Mos@@ es : and she said , Bec@@ ause I drew him out of the water .
and it came to pass in those days , when Mos@@ es was grown , that he went out un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and looked on their bur@@ den@@ s : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian s@@ mit@@ ing an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he sle@@ w the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to s@@ lay Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
now the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian had seven da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and they came and drew water , and filled the t@@ rough@@ s to water their father 's flock .
and the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds came and dro@@ ve them away : but Mos@@ es stood up and helped them , and wat@@ ered their flock .
and she b@@ are him a son , and he called his name Ger@@ sho@@ m : for he said , I have been a st@@ ran@@ ger in a st@@ range land .
and God heard their gro@@ an@@ ing , and God remember@@ ed his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Ab@@ ra@@ ham , with I@@ sa@@ ac , and with Jac@@ o@@ b .
and God looked upon the children of Israel , and God had respect un@@ to them .
now Mos@@ es kept the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro his father in law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian : and he led the flock to the back@@ side of the de@@ sert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Ho@@ re@@ b .
and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see , God called un@@ to him out of the mid@@ st of the b@@ ush , and said , Mos@@ es , Mos@@ es . and he said , H@@ ere am I@@ .
and he said , Dra@@ w not n@@ igh hi@@ ther : put off TH@@ Y sho@@ es from off TH@@ Y feet , for the place where@@ on th@@ ou stan@@ dest is hol@@ y ground .
moreover he said , I am the God of TH@@ Y father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . and Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and the Lord said , I have su@@ rely seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters ; for I know their sor@@ ro@@ ws ;
now therefore , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel is come un@@ to me : and I have also seen the op@@ pression where@@ with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to God , Wh@@ o am I , that I should go un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
and I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a m@@ igh@@ ty hand .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
and he said , cast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a ser@@ p@@ ent ; and Mos@@ es fled from before it .
and he said , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand into TH@@ Y bos@@ om again . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om again ; and p@@ lu@@ cked it out of his bos@@ om , and , be@@ hold , it was turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe the@@ e , neither he@@ arken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , Wh@@ o hat@@ h made man 's m@@ outh ? or who mak@@ eth the dum@@ b , or de@@ af , or the seeing , or the b@@ lin@@ d ? have not I the Lord ?
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to him , and put words in his m@@ outh : and I will be with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be TH@@ Y spokesman un@@ to the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to the@@ e instead of a m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be to him instead of God .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es in Mi@@ dian , G@@ o , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought TH@@ Y life .
and Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Mos@@ es took the ro@@ d of God in his hand .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , Israel is my son , even my fir@@ st@@ born :
and it came to pass by the way in the In@@ n , that the Lord met him , and sought to kill him .
and the Lord said to Aaron , G@@ o into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to meet Mos@@ es . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and Mos@@ es told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him , and all the signs which he had comman@@ ded him .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went and gathered together all the el@@ ders of the children of Israel :
and Aaron sp@@ ake all the words which the Lord had spoken un@@ to Mos@@ es , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and after@@ ward Mos@@ es and Aaron went in , and told P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast un@@ to me in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the king of Egypt said un@@ to them , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do ye , Mos@@ es and Aaron , let the people from their works ? get you un@@ to your bur@@ den@@ s .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said , be@@ hold , the people of the land now are many , and ye make them rest from their bur@@ den@@ s .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h comman@@ ded the same day the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
Y@@ e shall no more give the people stra@@ w to make bri@@ ck , as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore : let them go and gather stra@@ w for themselves .
let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour there@@ in ; and let them not regard v@@ ain words .
and the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they sp@@ ake to the people , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , I will not give you stra@@ w .
so the people were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather st@@ ub@@ ble instead of stra@@ w .
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cri@@ ed un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore deal@@ est th@@ ou thus with TH@@ Y servants ?
there is no stra@@ w given un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , and they say to us , Mak@@ e bri@@ ck : and , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no stra@@ w be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tal@@ e of bri@@ cks .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in ev@@ il case , after it was said , Y@@ e shall not min@@ ish ought from your bri@@ cks of your daily task .
and they met Mos@@ es and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h :
then the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Now s@@ halt th@@ ou see what I will do to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I appeared un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac , and un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , by the name of God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , but by my name J@@ eh@@ ov@@ ah was I not known to them .
and I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age , where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers .
and I have also heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge ; and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake so un@@ to the children of Israel : but they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to Mos@@ es for an@@ gu@@ ish of spirit , and for cru@@ el bon@@ da@@ ge .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , and gave them a charge un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these be the heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses : the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en the fir@@ st@@ born of Israel ; Han@@ o@@ ch , and Pal@@ lu , H@@ ez@@ ron , and Car@@ mi : these be the families of Re@@ ub@@ en .
and the sons of Simeon ; J@@ em@@ uel , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and the sons of Mer@@ ari ; Ma@@ hali and Mus@@ hi : these are the families of L@@ evi according to their generations .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to wife ; and she b@@ are him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Aaron took him E@@ lis@@ he@@ ba , daughter of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , sister of Na@@ ash@@ on , to wife ; and she b@@ are him Nad@@ a@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ hu , Ele@@ azar , and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
and the sons of Kor@@ ah ; As@@ si@@ r , and El@@ kan@@ ah , and A@@ bi@@ as@@ ap@@ h : these are the families of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes .
and Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took him one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el to wife ; and she b@@ are him Ph@@ ine@@ has : these are the heads of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Mos@@ es , to whom the Lord said , Br@@ ing out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which sp@@ ake to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and it came to pass on the day when the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the land of Egypt ,
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt speak all that I command the@@ e : and Aaron TH@@ Y brother shall speak un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
and I will har@@ den P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , and multi@@ ply my signs and my won@@ ders in the land of Egypt .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron did as the Lord comman@@ ded them , so did they .
and Mos@@ es was fo@@ ur@@ score years old , and Aaron fo@@ ur@@ score and three years old , when they sp@@ ake un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , saying ,
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall speak un@@ to you , saying , She@@ w a mir@@ acle for you : then th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to Aaron , T@@ ake TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and cast it before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and it shall become a ser@@ p@@ ent .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h also called the wise men and the sor@@ cer@@ ers : now the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , they also did in like manner with their en@@ chan@@ tments .
for they cast down every man his ro@@ d , and they became Ser@@ pen@@ ts : but Aaron 's ro@@ d sw@@ allowed up their ro@@ ds .
and he har@@ dened P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , that he hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to them ; as the Lord had said .
and the fish that is in the river shall die , and the river shall st@@ ink ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall lo@@ the to drink of the water of the river .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt did so with their en@@ chan@@ tments : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart was har@@ dened , neither did he he@@ arken un@@ to them ; as the Lord had said .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans dig@@ ged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and if th@@ ou refuse to let them go , be@@ hold , I will sm@@ ite all TH@@ Y borders with fro@@ gs :
and the fro@@ gs shall come up both on the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y people , and upon all TH@@ Y servants .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , S@@ ay un@@ to Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with TH@@ Y ro@@ d over the stre@@ ams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the fro@@ gs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians did so with their en@@ chan@@ tments , and brought up fro@@ gs upon the land of Egypt .
and the fro@@ gs shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and from TH@@ Y houses , and from TH@@ Y servants , and from TH@@ Y people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : and Mos@@ es cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord because of the fro@@ gs which he had brought against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
but when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that there was res@@ p@@ ite , he har@@ dened his heart , and hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to them ; as the Lord had said .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians did so with their en@@ chan@@ tments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon be@@ ast .
we will go three days ' journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sacrifice to the Lord our God , as he shall command us .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
for if th@@ ou refuse to let them go , and w@@ il@@ t hold them still ,
and the Lord shall sever between the c@@ attle of Israel and the c@@ attle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and the Lord appointed a set time , saying , To mor@@ row the Lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the Lord did that thing on the mor@@ row , and all the c@@ attle of Egypt died : but of the c@@ attle of the children of Israel died not one .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not one of the c@@ attle of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . and the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was har@@ dened , and he did not let the people go .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , T@@ ake to you hand@@ ful@@ s of ashes of the fur@@ n@@ ace , and let Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it toward the heav@@ en in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and it shall become small d@@ ust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a bo@@ il breaking forth with bla@@ ins upon man , and upon be@@ ast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians could not stand before Mos@@ es because of the bo@@ ils ; for the bo@@ il was upon the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and upon all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and the Lord har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and he hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to them ; as the Lord had spoken un@@ to Mos@@ es .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for I will at this time send all my plagu@@ es upon th@@ ine heart , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may sm@@ ite the@@ e and TH@@ Y people with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be cut off from the ear@@ th .
and in very de@@ ed for this cause have I raised the@@ e up , for to she@@ w in the@@ e my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th .
as yet ex@@ al@@ test th@@ ou th@@ y@@ self against my people , that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not let them go ?
be@@ hold , to mor@@ row about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as hat@@ h not been in Egypt since the foundation there@@ of even until now .
he that fear@@ ed the word of the Lord among the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h made his servants and his c@@ attle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his c@@ attle in the field .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d toward heav@@ en : and the Lord sent Th@@ under and ha@@ il , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord ra@@ ined ha@@ il upon the land of Egypt .
so there was ha@@ il , and fire min@@ g@@ led with the ha@@ il , very gri@@ ev@@ ous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the ha@@ il smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and be@@ ast ; and the ha@@ il smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and br@@ ake every tree of the field .
only in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , where the children of Israel were , was there no ha@@ il .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and called for Mos@@ es and Aaron , and said un@@ to them , I have sin@@ ned this time : the Lord is righ@@ te@@ ous , and I and my people are w@@ ic@@ ked .
In@@ treat the Lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more m@@ igh@@ ty th@@ under@@ ings and ha@@ il ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
but as for the@@ e and TH@@ Y servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God .
and the fla@@ x and the bar@@ ley was s@@ mit@@ ten : for the bar@@ ley was in the e@@ ar , and the fla@@ x was bol@@ led .
but the wheat and the ri@@ e were not s@@ mit@@ ten : for they were not grown up .
and Mos@@ es went out of the city from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and spread abroad his hands un@@ to the Lord : and the th@@ unders and ha@@ il ce@@ ased , and the rain was not p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th .
and when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that the rain and the ha@@ il and the th@@ unders were ce@@ ased , he sin@@ ned yet more , and har@@ dened his heart , he and his servants .
and the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was har@@ dened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the Lord had spoken by Mos@@ es .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ o in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : for I have har@@ dened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might she@@ w these my signs before him :
else , if th@@ ou refuse to let my people go , be@@ hold , to mor@@ row will I bring the loc@@ ust@@ s into TH@@ Y coast :
and Mos@@ es said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , with our f@@ loc@@ ks and with our her@@ ds will we go ; for we must hold a feast un@@ to the Lord .
and he said un@@ to them , Let the Lord be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for ev@@ il is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the Lord ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's presence .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
and the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very gri@@ ev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h called for Mos@@ es and Aaron in has@@ te ; and he said , I have sin@@ ned against the Lord your God , and against you .
now therefore for@@ give , I pra@@ y the@@ e , my sin only this once , and in@@ treat the Lord your God , that he may take away from me this death only .
and the Lord turned a m@@ igh@@ ty strong west wind , which took away the loc@@ ust@@ s , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the co@@ asts of Egypt .
but the Lord har@@ dened P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand toward heav@@ en , that there may be d@@ ark@@ ness over the land of Egypt , even d@@ ark@@ ness which may be felt .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand toward heav@@ en ; and there was a th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their d@@ wel@@ lings .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to him , G@@ et the@@ e from me , take heed to th@@ y@@ self , see my face no more ; for in that day th@@ ou se@@ est my face th@@ ou s@@ halt die .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let every man bor@@ row of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall not he@@ arken un@@ to you ; that my won@@ ders may be multi@@ p@@ lied in the land of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron did all these won@@ ders before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : and the Lord har@@ dened P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lam@@ b , let him and his neighbour next un@@ to his house take it according to the number of the so@@ ul@@ s ; every man according to his e@@ ating shall make your count for the lam@@ b .
your lam@@ b shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the she@@ ep , or from the go@@ ats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the up@@ per door post of the houses , where@@ in they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the f@@ les@@ h in that night , ro@@ ast with fire , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; and with bitter her@@ bs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor so@@ dden at all with water , but ro@@ ast with fire ; his head with his leg@@ s , and with the pur@@ tenance there@@ of .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remain@@ eth of it until the morning ye shall bur@@ n with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your lo@@ ins gir@@ ded , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in has@@ te : it is the Lord 's pass@@ over .
and ye shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this sel@@ f@@ same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
then Mos@@ es called for all the el@@ ders of Israel , and said un@@ to them , Dra@@ w out and take you a lam@@ b according to your families , and kill the pass@@ over .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hat@@ h promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say un@@ to you , What mean ye by this service ?
and the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es and Aaron , so did they .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
also take your f@@ loc@@ ks and your her@@ ds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and b@@ less me also .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in has@@ te ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the people took their d@@ ough before it was le@@ av@@ ened , their k@@ ne@@ ad@@ ing@@ t@@ rough@@ s being bound up in their clo@@ th@@ es upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , so that they l@@ ent un@@ to them such things as they required . and they sp@@ o@@ iled the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed from Ra@@ mes@@ es to Suc@@ co@@ th , about six hundred thousand on fo@@ ot that were men , bes@@ ide children .
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
now the so@@ jour@@ ning of the children of Israel , who d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the sel@@ f@@ same day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed un@@ to the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
but every man 's ser@@ vant that is bought for money , when th@@ ou h@@ ast circum@@ c@@ ised him , then shall he eat there@@ of .
thus did all the children of Israel ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the sel@@ f@@ same day , that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
seven days th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord .
Un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten seven days ; and there shall no le@@ av@@ ened bread be seen with the@@ e , neither shall there be le@@ av@@ en seen with the@@ e in all TH@@ Y quarters .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w TH@@ Y son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did un@@ to me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring the@@ e into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , as he sw@@ are un@@ to the@@ e and to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , and shall give it the@@ e ,
that th@@ ou s@@ halt set apart un@@ to the Lord all that open@@ eth the mat@@ ri@@ x , and every fir@@ st@@ ling that co@@ me@@ th of a be@@ ast which th@@ ou h@@ ast ; the mal@@ es shall be the Lord 's .
and it shall be for a to@@ ken upon th@@ ine hand , and for fron@@ t@@ lets between th@@ ine eyes : for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt .
but God led the people about , through the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up har@@ n@@ essed out of the land of Egypt .
and they took their journey from Suc@@ co@@ th , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Eth@@ am , in the edge of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
he took not away the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud by day , nor the pil@@ lar of fire by night , from before the people .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will say of the children of Israel , They are ent@@ ang@@ led in the land , the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness hat@@ h shut them in .
and he took six hundred chosen char@@ i@@ ots , and all the char@@ i@@ ots of Egypt , and cap@@ tains over every one of them .
and the Lord har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed after them , all the hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and his hor@@ se@@ men , and his army , and over@@ took them en@@ camp@@ ing by the sea , bes@@ ide P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , before Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ z@@ ep@@ h@@ on .
but lift th@@ ou up TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on d@@ ry ground through the mid@@ st of the sea .
and I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am the Lord , when I have gotten me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea upon the d@@ ry ground : and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed , and went in after them to the mid@@ st of the sea , even all P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hor@@ ses , his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked un@@ to the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans through the pil@@ lar of fire and of the cl@@ oud , and troubled the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , upon their char@@ i@@ ots , and upon their hor@@ se@@ men .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it ; and the Lord over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus the Lord sav@@ ed Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and Israel saw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans dead upon the sea shore .
then san@@ g Mos@@ es and the children of Israel this song un@@ to the Lord , and sp@@ ake , saying , I will sing un@@ to the Lord , for he hat@@ h tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously : the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der hat@@ h he thrown into the sea .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's char@@ i@@ ots and his host hat@@ h he cast into the sea : his chosen cap@@ tains also are dro@@ w@@ ned in the Red sea .
the dep@@ ths have covered them : they san@@ k into the bottom as a stone .
TH@@ Y right hand , O Lord , is become g@@ lor@@ ious in power : TH@@ Y right hand , O Lord , hat@@ h d@@ ashed in pieces the enemy .
and in the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy th@@ ou h@@ ast over@@ thrown them that rose up against the@@ e : th@@ ou sen@@ test forth TH@@ Y wr@@ ath , which consu@@ med them as st@@ ub@@ ble .
and with the blast of TH@@ Y nos@@ tr@@ ils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood u@@ pri@@ ght as an he@@ ap , and the dep@@ ths were con@@ ge@@ aled in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , I will pursue , I will over@@ take , I will divide the sp@@ oil ; my l@@ ust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my s@@ word , my hand shall destroy them .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st blow with TH@@ Y wind , the sea covered them : they san@@ k as lead in the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
T@@ ho@@ u in TH@@ Y mer@@ cy h@@ ast led forth the people which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed : th@@ ou h@@ ast gui@@ ded them in TH@@ Y strength un@@ to TH@@ Y hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sor@@ row shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palest@@ ina .
then the duk@@ es of E@@ dom shall be amaz@@ ed ; the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b , tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Can@@ a@@ an shall mel@@ t away .
fear and dre@@ ad shall fall upon them ; by the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; ti@@ ll TH@@ Y people pass over , O Lord , ti@@ ll the people pass over , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the sister of Aaron , took a tim@@ bre@@ l in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tim@@ bre@@ ls and with dan@@ ces .
so Mos@@ es brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and found no water .
and they came to E@@ lim , where were twelve wel@@ ls of water , and thre@@ es@@ core and ten pal@@ m trees : and they en@@ camp@@ ed there by the waters .
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and Aaron in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness :
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron said un@@ to all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hat@@ h brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the gl@@ ory of the Lord ; for that he he@@ aret@@ h your mur@@ mur@@ ings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye mur@@ mur against us ?
and it came to pass , as Aaron sp@@ ake un@@ to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the cl@@ oud .
and it came to pass , that at even the qu@@ ails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when they did M@@ ete it with an O@@ mer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to Mos@@ es ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and stan@@ k : and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with them .
and they gathered it every morning , every man according to his e@@ ating : and when the sun wa@@ xed hot , it mel@@ ted .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for one man : and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
and they laid it up ti@@ ll the morning , as Mos@@ es b@@ ade : and it did not st@@ ink , neither was there any wor@@ m there@@ in .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , in it there shall be none .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
and the house of Israel called the name there@@ of Man@@ na : and it was like cor@@ i@@ ander se@@ ed , white ; and the tas@@ te of it was like w@@ af@@ ers made with hon@@ ey .
as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so Aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came un@@ to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
now an O@@ mer is the tenth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h .
and the people thir@@ s@@ ted there for water ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es , and said , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore is this that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our c@@ attle with thir@@ st ?
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ o on before the people , and take with the@@ e of the el@@ ders of Israel ; and TH@@ Y ro@@ d , where@@ with th@@ ou smo@@ test the river , take in th@@ ine hand , and go .
so Jos@@ hua did as Mos@@ es had said to him , and fought with A@@ mal@@ ek : and Mos@@ es , Aaron , and H@@ ur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed : and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
and Jos@@ hua dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted A@@ mal@@ ek and his people with the edge of the s@@ word .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , W@@ r@@ ite this for a memorial in a book , and re@@ hear@@ se it in the e@@ ars of Jos@@ hua : for I will ut@@ ter@@ ly put out the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of A@@ mal@@ ek from under heav@@ en .
when J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and the name of the other was Eli@@ ez@@ er ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the s@@ word of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h :
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife un@@ to Mos@@ es into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where he en@@ camp@@ ed at the mount of God :
and he said un@@ to Mos@@ es , I TH@@ Y father in law J@@ eth@@ ro am come un@@ to the@@ e , and TH@@ Y wife , and her two sons with her .
and Mos@@ es went out to meet his father in law , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and k@@ is@@ sed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and J@@ eth@@ ro re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the Go@@ od@@ ness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
now I know that the Lord is greater than all go@@ ds : for in the thing where@@ in they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly he was above them .
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God : and Aaron came , and all the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father in law before God .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Mos@@ es from the morning un@@ to the evening .
when they have a matter , they come un@@ to me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the stat@@ utes of God , and his laws .
and Mos@@ es ' father in law said un@@ to him , The thing that th@@ ou do@@ est is not good .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t su@@ rely wear away , both th@@ ou , and this people that is with the@@ e : for this thing is too heavy for the@@ e ; th@@ ou art not able to perform it th@@ y@@ self alone .
Hear@@ ken now un@@ to my voice , I will give the@@ e coun@@ sel , and God shall be with the@@ e : be th@@ ou for the people to God@@ ward , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring the causes un@@ to God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt te@@ ach them ord@@ inan@@ ces and laws , and s@@ halt she@@ w them the way where@@ in they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt do this thing , and God command the@@ e so , then th@@ ou s@@ halt be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Mos@@ es hear@@ ken@@ ed to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Mos@@ es chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
and they jud@@ ged the people at all se@@ as@@ ons : the hard causes they brought un@@ to Mos@@ es , but every small matter they jud@@ ged themselves .
and Mos@@ es let his father in law de@@ part ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
for they were depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and were come to the de@@ sert of S@@ ina@@ i , and had pit@@ ched in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel camp@@ ed before the mount .
and Mos@@ es went up un@@ to God , and the Lord called un@@ to him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel ;
Y@@ e have seen what I did un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and how I b@@ are you on e@@ ag@@ les ' w@@ ings , and brought you un@@ to myself .
now therefore , if ye will obe@@ y my voice indeed , and keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , then ye shall be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure un@@ to me above all people : for all the ear@@ th is mine :
and Mos@@ es came and called for the el@@ ders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord comman@@ ded him .
and all the people answ@@ ered together , and said , All that the Lord hat@@ h spoken we will do . and Mos@@ es returned the words of the people un@@ to the Lord .

and two other r@@ ings of gold th@@ ou s@@ halt make , and s@@ halt put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part there@@ of , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and ben@@ e@@ ath upon the hem of it th@@ ou s@@ halt make po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , round about the hem there@@ of ; and bel@@ ls of gold between them round about :
and it shall be upon Aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he go@@ eth in un@@ to the hol@@ y place before the Lord , and when he co@@ me@@ th out , that he die not .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make a pla@@ te of p@@ ure gold , and grave upon it , like the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS TO the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it on a blue la@@ ce , that it may be upon the Mit@@ re ; upon the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the Mit@@ re it shall be .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt em@@ bro@@ i@@ der the co@@ at of fine lin@@ en , and th@@ ou s@@ halt make the Mit@@ re of fine lin@@ en , and th@@ ou s@@ halt make the gir@@ dle of ne@@ ed@@ le@@ work .
and for Aaron 's sons th@@ ou s@@ halt make co@@ ats , and th@@ ou s@@ halt make for them gir@@ d@@ les , and bon@@ n@@ ets s@@ halt th@@ ou make for them , for gl@@ ory and for beauty .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them upon Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons with him ; and s@@ halt ano@@ int them , and consec@@ rate them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy them , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make them lin@@ en bre@@ eches to cover their nak@@ edn@@ ess ; from the lo@@ ins even un@@ to the th@@ igh@@ s they shall reach :
and this is the thing that th@@ ou s@@ halt do un@@ to them to hal@@ low them , to minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office : take one young bul@@ lock , and two r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h ,
and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and cak@@ es un@@ le@@ av@@ ened temper@@ ed with oil , and w@@ af@@ ers un@@ le@@ av@@ ened ano@@ in@@ ted with oil : of whe@@ aten fl@@ our s@@ halt th@@ ou make them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them into one bas@@ ket , and bring them in the bas@@ ket , with the bul@@ lock and the two r@@ ams .
and Aaron and his sons th@@ ou s@@ halt bring un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and s@@ halt was@@ h them with water .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the gar@@ ments , and put upon Aaron the co@@ at , and the ro@@ be of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and gir@@ d him with the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put the Mit@@ re upon his head , and put the hol@@ y cro@@ wn upon the Mit@@ re .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause a bul@@ lock to be brought before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bul@@ lock .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt kill the bul@@ lock before the Lord , by the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take all the f@@ at that cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the ca@@ ul that is above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and the f@@ at that is upon them , and bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar .
but the f@@ les@@ h of the bul@@ lock , and his s@@ kin , and his D@@ ung , s@@ halt th@@ ou bur@@ n with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt s@@ lay the ram , and th@@ ou s@@ halt take his blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it round about upon the alt@@ ar .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt cut the ram in pieces , and was@@ h the in@@ wards of him , and his leg@@ s , and put them un@@ to his pieces , and un@@ to his head .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n the whole ram upon the alt@@ ar : it is a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord : it is a swe@@ et sav@@ our , an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and s@@ halt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt receive them of their hands , and bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the bre@@ ast of the ram of Aaron 's consec@@ ration , and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord : and it shall be TH@@ Y part .
and the hol@@ y gar@@ ments of Aaron shall be his sons ' after him , to be ano@@ in@@ ted there@@ in , and to be consec@@ rated in them .
and that son that is pri@@ est in his stead shall put them on seven days , when he co@@ me@@ th into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation to minister in the hol@@ y place .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the ram of the consec@@ ration , and se@@ e@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in the hol@@ y place .
and they shall eat those things where@@ with the At@@ on@@ ement was made , to consec@@ rate and to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them : but a st@@ ran@@ ger shall not eat there@@ of , because they are hol@@ y .
and if ought of the f@@ les@@ h of the consec@@ r@@ ations , or of the bread , remain un@@ to the morning , then th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n the remain@@ der with fire : it shall not be e@@ aten , because it is hol@@ y .
and thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to Aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which I have comman@@ ded the@@ e : seven days s@@ halt th@@ ou consec@@ rate them .
seven days th@@ ou s@@ halt make an At@@ on@@ ement for the alt@@ ar , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy it ; and it shall be an alt@@ ar most hol@@ y : wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the alt@@ ar shall be hol@@ y .
now this is that which th@@ ou s@@ halt offer upon the alt@@ ar ; two lam@@ bs of the first year day by day continu@@ ally .
the one lam@@ b th@@ ou s@@ halt offer in the morning ; and the other lam@@ b th@@ ou s@@ halt offer at even :
and with the one lam@@ b a tenth deal of fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering .
this shall be a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering throughout your generations at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the Lord : where I will meet you , to speak there un@@ to the@@ e .
and there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied by my gl@@ ory .
and I will sanc@@ ti@@ fy the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the alt@@ ar : I will sanc@@ ti@@ fy also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and I will d@@ well among the children of Israel , and will be their God .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may d@@ well among them : I am the Lord their God .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make an alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se upon : of sh@@ it@@ tim wood s@@ halt th@@ ou make it .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay it with p@@ ure gold , the top there@@ of , and the sides there@@ of round about , and the hor@@ ns there@@ of ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to it a cro@@ wn of gold round about .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make the st@@ aves of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ lay them with gold .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it before the v@@ ail that is by the Ar@@ k of the testimony , before the mer@@ cy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with the@@ e .
and Aaron shall bur@@ n there@@ on swe@@ et incen@@ se every morning : when he d@@ res@@ set@@ h the lam@@ ps , he shall bur@@ n incen@@ se upon it .
and when Aaron ligh@@ te@@ th the lam@@ ps at even , he shall bur@@ n incen@@ se upon it , a perpet@@ ual incen@@ se before the Lord throughout your generations .
Y@@ e shall offer no st@@ range incen@@ se there@@ on , nor bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , nor meat offering ; neither shall ye p@@ our drink offering there@@ on .
this they shall give , every one that pass@@ eth among them that are num@@ ber@@ ed , half a sh@@ ek@@ el after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : ( a sh@@ ek@@ el is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s : ) an half sh@@ ek@@ el shall be the offering of the Lord .
every one that pass@@ eth among them that are num@@ ber@@ ed , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering un@@ to the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a sh@@ ek@@ el , when they give an offering un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s .
and of cas@@ sia five hundred sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and of oil olive an hin :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make it an oil of hol@@ y o@@ in@@ tment , an o@@ in@@ tment compo@@ und after the art of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ ary : it shall be an hol@@ y ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ano@@ int Aaron and his sons , and consec@@ rate them , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , This shall be an hol@@ y ano@@ in@@ ting oil un@@ to me throughout your generations .
upon man 's f@@ les@@ h shall it not be p@@ oured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is hol@@ y , and it shall be hol@@ y un@@ to you .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever compo@@ un@@ de@@ th any like it , or wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever p@@ ut@@ te@@ th any of it upon a st@@ ran@@ ger , shall even be cut off from his people .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , T@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e swe@@ et sp@@ ices , stac@@ te , and ony@@ ch@@ a , and gal@@ ban@@ um ; these swe@@ et sp@@ ices with p@@ ure fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se : of each shall there be a like weight :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make it a perf@@ ume , a conf@@ ection after the art of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ ary , temper@@ ed together , p@@ ure and hol@@ y :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , where I will meet with the@@ e : it shall be un@@ to you most hol@@ y .
and as for the perf@@ ume which th@@ ou s@@ halt make , ye shall not make to yo@@ ur@@ selves according to the composition there@@ of : it shall be un@@ to the@@ e hol@@ y for the Lord .
see , I have called by name B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h :
and I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wis@@ dom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of work@@ manship ,
and in cutting of stones , to set them , and in car@@ ving of tim@@ ber , to work in all manner of work@@ manship .
the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the Ar@@ k of the testimony , and the mer@@ cy seat that is there@@ upon , and all the furniture of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
and the table and his furniture , and the p@@ ure cand@@ le@@ stick with all his furniture , and the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se ,
and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering with all his furniture , and the lav@@ er and his fo@@ ot ,
and the clo@@ ths of service , and the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office ,
and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and swe@@ et incen@@ se for the hol@@ y place : according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e shall they do .
Y@@ e shall keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath therefore ; for it is hol@@ y un@@ to you : every one that def@@ il@@ eth it shall su@@ rely be put to death : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth any work there@@ in , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the Lord made heav@@ en and ear@@ th , and on the seventh day he rested , and was ref@@ res@@ hed .
and he gave un@@ to Mos@@ es , when he had made an end of commun@@ ing with him upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the fin@@ ger of God .
and Aaron said un@@ to them , Bre@@ ak off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them un@@ to me .
and all the people br@@ ake off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars , and brought them un@@ to Aaron .
and when Aaron saw it , he built an alt@@ ar before it ; and Aaron made proc@@ lamation , and said , To mor@@ row is a feast to the Lord .
and they rose up early on the mor@@ row , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and brought peace offer@@ ings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , I have seen this people , and , be@@ hold , it is a sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wr@@ ath may wa@@ x hot against them , and that I may consum@@ e them : and I will make of the@@ e a great nation .
and Mos@@ es bes@@ ought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why do@@ th TH@@ Y wr@@ ath wa@@ x hot against TH@@ Y people , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ?
and the Lord re@@ pen@@ ted of the ev@@ il which he thought to do un@@ to his people .
and Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , Gra@@ ven upon the tables .
and when Jos@@ hua heard the no@@ ise of the people as they sh@@ ou@@ ted , he said un@@ to Mos@@ es , There is a no@@ ise of war in the camp .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that sh@@ out for mas@@ tery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the no@@ ise of them that sing do I hear .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it in the fire , and ground it to pow@@ der , and stra@@ wed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said un@@ to me , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
and when Mos@@ es saw that the people were nak@@ ed ; ( for Aaron had made them nak@@ ed un@@ to their sh@@ ame among their enem@@ ies : )
then Mos@@ es stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Wh@@ o is on the Lord 's side ? let him come un@@ to me . and all the sons of L@@ evi gathered themselves together un@@ to him .
and the children of L@@ evi did according to the word of Mos@@ es : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Y@@ e have sin@@ ned a great sin : and now I will go up un@@ to the Lord ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for your sin .
yet now , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t for@@ give their sin@@ -- ; and if not , blo@@ t me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of TH@@ Y book which th@@ ou h@@ ast written .
therefore now go , lead the people un@@ to the place of which I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : be@@ hold , mine Angel shall go before the@@ e : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and when the people heard these ev@@ il ti@@ dings , they mour@@ ned : and no man did put on him his or@@ nam@@ ents .
and the children of Israel stri@@ pped themselves of their or@@ nam@@ ents by the mount Ho@@ re@@ b .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es went out un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Mos@@ es , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Mos@@ es entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar des@@ cen@@ ded , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the Lord talked with Mos@@ es .
and all the people saw the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar stand at the tab@@ ern@@ acle door : and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ pped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , I will do this thing also that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken : for th@@ ou h@@ ast found grace in my sight , and I know the@@ e by name .
and he said , T@@ ho@@ u can@@ st not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
and I will take away mine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , H@@ ew the@@ e two tables of stone like un@@ to the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est .
and no man shall come up with the@@ e , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the f@@ loc@@ ks nor her@@ ds fe@@ ed before that mount .
and the Lord des@@ cen@@ ded in the cl@@ oud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the Lord .
and Mos@@ es made has@@ te , and bo@@ wed his head toward the ear@@ th , and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
observe th@@ ou that which I command the@@ e this day : be@@ hold , I drive out before the@@ e the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self , lest th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e :
for th@@ ou s@@ halt worship no other go@@ d : for the Lord , whose name is Je@@ al@@ ous , is a Je@@ al@@ ous God :
L@@ est th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and do sacrifice un@@ to their go@@ ds , and one call the@@ e , and th@@ ou eat of his sacrifice ;
and th@@ ou take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to TH@@ Y sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and make TH@@ Y sons go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds .
six days th@@ ou s@@ halt work , but on the seventh day th@@ ou s@@ halt rest : in ear@@ ing time and in har@@ v@@ est th@@ ou s@@ halt rest .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe the feast of weeks , of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of wheat har@@ v@@ est , and the feast of ing@@ a@@ ther@@ ing at the year 's end .
Th@@ ri@@ ce in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
for I will cast out the nations before the@@ e , and en@@ large TH@@ Y borders : neither shall any man desire TH@@ Y land , when th@@ ou s@@ halt go up to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God th@@ ri@@ ce in the year .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with le@@ av@@ en ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the pass@@ over be left un@@ to the morning .
the first of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of TH@@ Y land th@@ ou s@@ halt bring un@@ to the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God . T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not se@@ e@@ the a k@@ id in his mother 's milk .
and he was there with the Lord for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come n@@ igh him .
and Mos@@ es called un@@ to them ; and Aaron and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation returned un@@ to him : and Mos@@ es talked with them .
and after@@ ward all the children of Israel came n@@ igh : and he gave them in comman@@ d@@ ment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount S@@ ina@@ i .
and ti@@ ll Mos@@ es had done speaking with them , he put a v@@ ail on his face .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Mos@@ es , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the v@@ ail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Mos@@ es gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel together , and said un@@ to them , These are the words which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , that ye should do them .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an hol@@ y day , a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of rest to the Lord : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth work there@@ in shall be put to death .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord comman@@ ded , saying ,
and ony@@ x stones , and stones to be set for the ep@@ ho@@ d , and for the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te .
the tab@@ ern@@ acle , his tent , and his covering , his t@@ aches , and his boards , his bars , his pil@@ lars , and his so@@ c@@ kets ,
the Ar@@ k , and the st@@ aves there@@ of , with the mer@@ cy seat , and the v@@ ail of the covering ,
the cand@@ le@@ stick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lam@@ ps , with the oil for the light ,
and the incen@@ se alt@@ ar , and his st@@ aves , and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and the swe@@ et incen@@ se , and the han@@ ging for the door at the entering in of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with his br@@ as@@ en gr@@ ate , his st@@ aves , and all his vessels , the lav@@ er and his fo@@ ot ,
the han@@ g@@ ings of the court , his pil@@ lars , and their so@@ c@@ kets , and the han@@ ging for the door of the court ,
the p@@ ins of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the p@@ ins of the court , and their cor@@ ds ,
the clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the hol@@ y place , the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel depar@@ ted from the presence of Mos@@ es .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and br@@ ass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found sh@@ it@@ tim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hear@@ ted did sp@@ in with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , both of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine lin@@ en .
and all the women whose heart s@@ tir@@ red them up in wis@@ dom sp@@ un go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir .
and the rul@@ ers brought ony@@ x stones , and stones to be set , for the ep@@ ho@@ d , and for the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te ;
and sp@@ ice , and oil for the light , and for the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and for the swe@@ et incen@@ se .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering un@@ to the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had comman@@ ded to be made by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and he hat@@ h filled him with the spirit of God , in wis@@ dom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of work@@ manship ;
and to dev@@ ise cur@@ ious works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in br@@ ass ,
and in the cutting of stones , to set them , and in car@@ ving of wood , to make any manner of c@@ un@@ ning work .
and he hat@@ h put in his heart that he may te@@ ach , both he , and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan .
and all the wise men , that w@@ rought all the work of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , came every man from his work which they made ;
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the Lord comman@@ ded to make .
for the stu@@ ff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
and every wise hear@@ ted man among them that w@@ rought the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle made ten cur@@ tains of fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en , and blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let : with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms of c@@ un@@ ning work made he them .
the length of one cur@@ tain was twenty and eight cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th of one cur@@ tain four cu@@ bi@@ ts : the cur@@ tains were all of one size .
and he coup@@ led the five cur@@ tains one un@@ to another : and the other five cur@@ tains he coup@@ led one un@@ to another .
and he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling : likewise he made in the ut@@ ter@@ most side of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in one cur@@ tain , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in the edge of the cur@@ tain which was in the cou@@ pling of the second : the lo@@ ops held one cur@@ tain to another .
and he made fif@@ ty t@@ aches of gold , and coup@@ led the cur@@ tains one un@@ to another with the t@@ aches : so it became one tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and he made cur@@ tains of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for the tent over the tab@@ ern@@ acle : eleven cur@@ tains he made them .
the length of one cur@@ tain was thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts was the b@@ read@@ th of one cur@@ tain : the eleven cur@@ tains were of one size .
and he made fif@@ ty t@@ aches of br@@ ass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
and he made a covering for the tent of r@@ ams ' sk@@ ins d@@ yed red , and a covering of bad@@ gers ' sk@@ ins above that .
and he made boards for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , standing up .
the length of a board was ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th of a board one cu@@ bit and a half .
one board had two ten@@ ons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and he made boards for the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; twenty boards for the south side sou@@ th@@ ward :
and for@@ ty so@@ c@@ kets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two so@@ c@@ kets under one board for his two ten@@ ons , and two so@@ c@@ kets under another board for his two ten@@ ons .
and two boards made he for the cor@@ ners of the tab@@ ern@@ acle in the two sides .
and they were coup@@ led ben@@ e@@ ath , and coup@@ led together at the head there@@ of , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the cor@@ ners .
and he made bars of sh@@ it@@ tim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
and he made the middle bar to sho@@ ot through the boards from the one end to the other .
and he over@@ laid the boards with gold , and made their r@@ ings of gold to be places for the bars , and over@@ laid the bars with gold .
and he made a v@@ ail of blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en : with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms made he it of c@@ un@@ ning work .
and he made there@@ un@@ to four pil@@ lars of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ laid them with gold : their ho@@ oks were of gold ; and he cast for them four so@@ c@@ kets of silver .
and he made an han@@ ging for the tab@@ ern@@ acle door of blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en , of ne@@ ed@@ le@@ work ;
and the five pil@@ lars of it with their ho@@ oks : and he over@@ laid their chap@@ it@@ ers and their fil@@ lets with gold : but their five so@@ c@@ kets were of br@@ ass .
and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold within and without , and made a cro@@ wn of gold to it round about .

and of the blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , they made clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the hol@@ y place , and made the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and they did beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , and in the pur@@ ple , and in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , with c@@ un@@ ning work .
they made sho@@ ul@@ der@@ pieces for it , to couple it together : by the two ed@@ ges was it coup@@ led together .
and they w@@ rought ony@@ x stones inc@@ los@@ ed in ou@@ ches of gold , Gra@@ ven , as sign@@ ets are Gra@@ ven , with the names of the children of Israel .

and there was an hol@@ e in the mid@@ st of the ro@@ be , as the hol@@ e of an haber@@ ge@@ on , with a band round about the hol@@ e , that it should not ren@@ d .

and they tied un@@ to it a la@@ ce of blue , to fas@@ ten it on high upon the Mit@@ re ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
thus was all the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation finished : and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so did they .
according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Mos@@ es did look upon all the work , and , be@@ hold , they have done it as the Lord had comman@@ ded , even so had they done it : and Mos@@ es b@@ les@@ sed them .
on the first day of the first month s@@ halt th@@ ou set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put there@@ in the Ar@@ k of the testimony , and cover the Ar@@ k with the v@@ ail .

thus did Mos@@ es : according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded him , so did he .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up .
and Mos@@ es re@@ ar@@ ed up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and fas@@ tened his so@@ c@@ kets , and set up the boards there@@ of , and put in the bars there@@ of , and re@@ ar@@ ed up his pil@@ lars .
and he spread abroad the tent over the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he took and put the testimony into the Ar@@ k , and set the st@@ aves on the Ar@@ k , and put the mer@@ cy seat above upon the Ar@@ k :
and he brought the Ar@@ k into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and set up the v@@ ail of the covering , and covered the Ar@@ k of the testimony ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he put the table in the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , upon the side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle nor@@ th@@ ward , without the v@@ ail .
and he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord ; as the Lord had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he put the cand@@ le@@ stick in the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , over against the table , on the side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle sou@@ th@@ ward .
and he put the golden alt@@ ar in the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the v@@ ail :
and he set up the han@@ ging at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and he set the lav@@ er between the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation and the alt@@ ar , and put water there , to was@@ h with@@ al .
when they went into the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and when they came near un@@ to the alt@@ ar , they was@@ hed ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up the court round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the alt@@ ar , and set up the han@@ ging of the court gate . so Mos@@ es finished the work .
then a cl@@ oud covered the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and Mos@@ es was not able to enter into the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , because the cl@@ oud abo@@ de there@@ on , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the children of Israel went on@@ ward in all their jour@@ neys :
but if the cl@@ oud were not taken up , then they jour@@ ne@@ yed not ti@@ ll the day that it was taken up .
for the cl@@ oud of the Lord was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their jour@@ neys .
and the Lord called un@@ to Mos@@ es , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , saying ,

speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a sou@@ l shall sin through ignor@@ ance against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the pri@@ est that is ano@@ in@@ ted do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h un@@ to the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bul@@ lock un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bul@@ lock 's head , and kill the bul@@ lock before the Lord .

as it was taken off from the bul@@ lock of the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings : and the pri@@ est shall bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering .
when the sin , which they have sin@@ ned against it , is known , then the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer a young bul@@ lock for the sin , and bring him before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the el@@ ders of the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bul@@ lock before the Lord : and the bul@@ lock shall be killed before the Lord .

and he shall carry forth the bul@@ lock without the camp , and bur@@ n him as he burned the first bul@@ lock : it is a sin offering for the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
when a ru@@ ler hat@@ h sin@@ ned , and done somewhat through ignor@@ ance against any of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ;
or if his sin , where@@ in he hat@@ h sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a k@@ id of the go@@ ats , a male without ble@@ mis@@ h :

and this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord , before the alt@@ ar .
and the remain@@ der there@@ of shall Aaron and his sons eat : with un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall it be e@@ aten in the hol@@ y place ; in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation they shall eat it .
and the pri@@ est of his sons that is ano@@ in@@ ted in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever un@@ to the Lord , it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly bur@@ n@@ t .
the pri@@ est that offer@@ eth it for sin shall eat it : in the hol@@ y place shall it be e@@ aten , in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall touch the f@@ les@@ h there@@ of shall be hol@@ y : and when there is sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led of the blood there@@ of upon any gar@@ ment , th@@ ou s@@ halt was@@ h that where@@ on it was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led in the hol@@ y place .

and no sin offering , where@@ of any of the blood is brought into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation to reconc@@ ile with@@ al in the hol@@ y place , shall be e@@ aten : it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .
in the place where they kill the bur@@ n@@ t offering shall they kill the t@@ res@@ pass offering : and the blood there@@ of shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le round about upon the alt@@ ar .
and the pri@@ est shall bur@@ n them upon the alt@@ ar for an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : it is a t@@ res@@ pass offering .
as the sin offering is , so is the t@@ res@@ pass offering : there is one law for them : the pri@@ est that mak@@ eth At@@ on@@ ement there@@ with shall have it .
and the pri@@ est that offer@@ eth any man 's bur@@ n@@ t offering , even the pri@@ est shall have to himself the s@@ kin of the bur@@ n@@ t offering which he hat@@ h offered .
and all the meat offering that is bak@@ en in the ov@@ en , and all that is d@@ ressed in the f@@ ry@@ ing@@ pan , and in the pan , shall be the pri@@ est 's that offer@@ eth it .
and every meat offering , min@@ g@@ led with oil , and d@@ ry , shall all the sons of Aaron have , one as much as another .
and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , which he shall offer un@@ to the Lord .
if he offer it for a Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es min@@ g@@ led with oil , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened w@@ af@@ ers ano@@ in@@ ted with oil , and cak@@ es min@@ g@@ led with oil , of fine fl@@ our , fri@@ ed .
besides the cak@@ es , he shall offer for his offering le@@ av@@ ened bread with the sacrifice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving of his peace offer@@ ings .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord , and it shall be the pri@@ est 's that sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le@@ th the blood of the peace offer@@ ings .
and the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice of his peace offer@@ ings for Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving shall be e@@ aten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
but the remain@@ der of the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice on the third day shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire .
and the f@@ les@@ h that tou@@ ch@@ eth any un@@ clean thing shall not be e@@ aten ; it shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire : and as for the f@@ les@@ h , all that be clean shall eat there@@ of .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fo@@ w@@ l or of be@@ ast , in any of your d@@ wel@@ lings .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that e@@ ate@@ th any manner of blood , even that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people .
his own hands shall bring the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , the f@@ at with the bre@@ ast , it shall he bring , that the bre@@ ast may be w@@ av@@ ed for a wave offering before the Lord .
and the pri@@ est shall bur@@ n the f@@ at upon the alt@@ ar : but the bre@@ ast shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' .
and the right sho@@ ul@@ der shall ye give un@@ to the pri@@ est for an he@@ ave offering of the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of your peace offer@@ ings .
he among the sons of Aaron , that offer@@ eth the blood of the peace offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at , shall have the right sho@@ ul@@ der for his part .
which the Lord comman@@ ded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he ano@@ in@@ ted them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es in mount S@@ ina@@ i , in the day that he comman@@ ded the children of Israel to offer their ob@@ lations un@@ to the Lord , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
and Mos@@ es did as the Lord comman@@ ded him ; and the assembly was gathered together un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and Mos@@ es brought Aaron and his sons , and was@@ hed them with water .
and he put the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te upon him : also he put in the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te the U@@ rim and the Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
and he put the Mit@@ re upon his head ; also upon the Mit@@ re , even upon his fo@@ ref@@ ront , did he put the golden pla@@ te , the hol@@ y cro@@ wn ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and Mos@@ es took the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and ano@@ in@@ ted the tab@@ ern@@ acle and all that was there@@ in , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied them .
and he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led there@@ of upon the alt@@ ar seven times , and ano@@ in@@ ted the alt@@ ar and all his vessels , both the lav@@ er and his fo@@ ot , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
and he p@@ oured of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil upon Aaron 's head , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy him .
and Mos@@ es brought Aaron 's sons , and put co@@ ats upon them , and gir@@ ded them with gir@@ d@@ les , and put bon@@ n@@ ets upon them ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he brought the bul@@ lock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bul@@ lock for the sin offering .
and he took all the f@@ at that was upon the in@@ wards , and ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and their f@@ at , and Mos@@ es burned it upon the alt@@ ar .
but the bul@@ lock , and his hide , his f@@ les@@ h , and his D@@ ung , he bur@@ n@@ t with fire without the camp ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he brought the ram for the bur@@ n@@ t offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he killed it ; and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar round about .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Mos@@ es bur@@ n@@ t the head , and the pieces , and the f@@ at .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consec@@ ration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he put all upon Aaron 's hands , and upon his sons ' hands , and w@@ av@@ ed them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and that which remain@@ eth of the f@@ les@@ h and of the bread shall ye bur@@ n with fire .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation in seven days , until the days of your consec@@ ration be at an end : for seven days shall he consec@@ rate you .
as he hat@@ h done this day , so the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded to do , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the Lord , that ye die not : for so I am comman@@ ded .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that Mos@@ es called Aaron and his sons , and the el@@ ders of Israel ;
and they brought that which Mos@@ es comman@@ ded before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation drew near and stood before the Lord .
and Mos@@ es said , This is the thing which the Lord comman@@ ded that ye should do : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall appear un@@ to you .
Aaron therefore went un@@ to the alt@@ ar , and sle@@ w the cal@@ f of the sin offering , which was for himself .
but the f@@ at , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver of the sin offering , he bur@@ n@@ t upon the alt@@ ar ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the f@@ les@@ h and the hide he bur@@ n@@ t with fire without the camp .
and he sle@@ w the bur@@ n@@ t offering ; and Aaron 's sons presented un@@ to him the blood , which he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led round about upon the alt@@ ar .
and they presented the bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to him , with the pieces there@@ of , and the head : and he bur@@ n@@ t them upon the alt@@ ar .
and he did was@@ h the in@@ wards and the leg@@ s , and bur@@ n@@ t them upon the bur@@ n@@ t offering on the alt@@ ar .
and he brought the people 's offering , and took the go@@ at , which was the sin offering for the people , and sle@@ w it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
and he brought the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and offered it according to the manner .
and he brought the meat offering , and took an hand@@ ful there@@ of , and bur@@ n@@ t it upon the alt@@ ar , bes@@ ide the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice of the morning .
he sle@@ w also the bul@@ lock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented un@@ to him the blood , which he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon the alt@@ ar round about ,
and the f@@ at of the bul@@ lock and of the ram , the rum@@ p , and that which cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver :
and they put the f@@ at upon the bre@@ asts , and he bur@@ n@@ t the f@@ at upon the alt@@ ar :
and the bre@@ asts and the right sho@@ ul@@ der Aaron w@@ av@@ ed for a wave offering before the Lord ; as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded .
and Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and b@@ les@@ sed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and peace offer@@ ings .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and came out , and b@@ les@@ sed the people : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the Lord , and consu@@ med upon the alt@@ ar the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the f@@ at : which when all the people saw , they sh@@ ou@@ ted , and fell on their faces .
and Mos@@ es called Mis@@ ha@@ el and El@@ z@@ ap@@ han , the sons of Uz@@ zi@@ el the un@@ cle of Aaron , and said un@@ to them , C@@ ome near , carry your bre@@ th@@ ren from before the sanc@@ tu@@ ary out of the camp .
so they went near , and carried them in their co@@ ats out of the camp ; as Mos@@ es had said .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , th@@ ou , nor TH@@ Y sons with the@@ e , when ye go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and that ye may put difference between hol@@ y and un@@ hol@@ y , and between un@@ clean and clean ;
and that ye may te@@ ach the children of Israel all the stat@@ utes which the Lord hat@@ h spoken un@@ to them by the hand of Mos@@ es .
be@@ hold , the blood of it was not brought in within the hol@@ y place : ye should indeed have e@@ aten it in the hol@@ y place , as I comman@@ ded .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , saying un@@ to them ,
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , These are the be@@ asts which ye shall eat among all the be@@ asts that are on the ear@@ th .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and is cl@@ ov@@ en@@ fo@@ oted , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , among the be@@ asts , that shall ye eat .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the C@@ ame@@ l , because he che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ de@@ th not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and the con@@ ey , because he che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ de@@ th not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and the h@@ are , because he che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ de@@ th not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and the sw@@ ine , though he divide the ho@@ of , and be cl@@ ov@@ en@@ fo@@ oted , yet he che@@ w@@ eth not the cu@@ d ; he is un@@ clean to you .
of their f@@ les@@ h shall ye not eat , and their car@@ case shall ye not touch ; they are un@@ clean to you .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you :
they shall be even an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you ; ye shall not eat of their f@@ les@@ h , but ye shall have their car@@ cases in ab@@ omin@@ ation .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h no fin@@ s nor scal@@ es in the waters , that shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you .
and the vul@@ ture , and the k@@ ite after his kind ;
and the ow@@ l , and the night ha@@ w@@ k , and the c@@ uc@@ ko@@ w , and the ha@@ w@@ k after his kind ,
and the stor@@ k , the her@@ on after her kind , and the lap@@ wing , and the B@@ AT .
yet these may ye eat of every flying cre@@ eping thing that go@@ eth upon all four , which have leg@@ s above their feet , to le@@ ap with@@ al upon the ear@@ th ;
but all other flying cre@@ eping things , which have four feet , shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever be@@ aret@@ h ought of the car@@ case of them shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon his pa@@ ws , among all manner of be@@ asts that go on all four , those are un@@ clean un@@ to you : wh@@ os@@ o tou@@ ch@@ eth their car@@ case shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that be@@ aret@@ h the car@@ case of them shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : they are un@@ clean un@@ to you .
these are un@@ clean to you among all that cre@@ ep : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ th touch them , when they be dead , shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and every ear@@ then ves@@ sel , where@@ into any of them fal@@ le@@ th , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is in it shall be un@@ clean ; and ye shall break it .
of all meat which may be e@@ aten , that on which such water co@@ me@@ th shall be un@@ clean : and all drink that may be dr@@ un@@ k in every such ves@@ sel shall be un@@ clean .
nevertheless a fo@@ un@@ tain or p@@ it , where@@ in there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which tou@@ ch@@ eth their car@@ case shall be un@@ clean .
and if any part of their car@@ case fall upon any so@@ wing se@@ ed which is to be so@@ wn , it shall be clean .
but if any water be put upon the se@@ ed , and any part of their car@@ case fall there@@ on , it shall be un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and if any be@@ ast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that tou@@ ch@@ eth the car@@ case there@@ of shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that e@@ ate@@ th of the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : he also that be@@ aret@@ h the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even .

wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon the bel@@ ly , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon all four , or wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h more feet among all cre@@ eping things that cre@@ ep upon the ear@@ th , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
Y@@ e shall not make yo@@ ur@@ selves ab@@ omin@@ able with any cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth , neither shall ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ clean with them , that ye should be def@@ iled there@@ by .
for I am the Lord that br@@ ing@@ eth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be hol@@ y , for I am hol@@ y .
and in the eighth day the f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin shall be circum@@ c@@ ised .
but if she bear a ma@@ id child , then she shall be un@@ clean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her pur@@ ifying thre@@ es@@ core and six days .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hat@@ h born a male or a female .
but if the sc@@ a@@ b spread much abroad in the s@@ kin , after that he hat@@ h been seen of the pri@@ est for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the pri@@ est again :
and if the pri@@ est see that , be@@ hold , the sc@@ a@@ b sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th in the s@@ kin , then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean : it is a le@@ pro@@ sy .
when the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy is in a man , then he shall be brought un@@ to the pri@@ est ;
and the pri@@ est shall see him : and , be@@ hold , if the rising be white in the s@@ kin , and it have turned the ha@@ ir white , and there be quick raw f@@ les@@ h in the rising ;
it is an old le@@ pro@@ sy in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h , and the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean , and shall not shut him up : for he is un@@ clean .
and the pri@@ est shall see the raw f@@ les@@ h , and pron@@ oun@@ ce him to be un@@ clean : for the raw f@@ les@@ h is un@@ clean : it is a le@@ pro@@ sy .
or if the raw f@@ les@@ h turn again , and be changed un@@ to white , he shall come un@@ to the pri@@ est ;
the f@@ les@@ h also , in which , even in the s@@ kin there@@ of , was a bo@@ il , and is he@@ aled ,
and in the place of the bo@@ il there be a white rising , or a bright spot , white , and somewhat red@@ dish , and it be she@@ wed to the pri@@ est ;
and if it spread much abroad in the s@@ kin , then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean : it is a pla@@ gue .
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning bo@@ il ; and the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean .
or if there be any f@@ les@@ h , in the s@@ kin where@@ of there is a hot burning , and the quick f@@ les@@ h that bur@@ net@@ h have a white bright spot , somewhat red@@ dish , or white ;
and the pri@@ est shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the s@@ kin , then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean : it is the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy .
and in the seventh day the pri@@ est shall look on the pla@@ gue : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all spread not , and there be in it no yel@@ low ha@@ ir , and the sc@@ all be not in sight deeper than the s@@ kin ;
he shall be sha@@ ven , but the sc@@ all shall he not s@@ have ; and the pri@@ est shall shut up him that hat@@ h the sc@@ all seven days more :
then the pri@@ est shall look on him : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all be spread in the s@@ kin , the pri@@ est shall not seek for yel@@ low ha@@ ir ; he is un@@ clean .
but if the sc@@ all be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black ha@@ ir grown up there@@ in ; the sc@@ all is he@@ aled , he is clean : and the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the s@@ kin of their f@@ les@@ h bright spots , even white bright spots ;
and the man whose ha@@ ir is fallen off his head , he is bal@@ d ; yet is he clean .
and he that hat@@ h his ha@@ ir fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is fore@@ head bal@@ d : yet is he clean .
and if there be in the bal@@ d head , or bal@@ d fore@@ head , a white red@@ dish sor@@ e ; it is a le@@ pro@@ sy sp@@ run@@ g up in his bal@@ d head , or his bal@@ d fore@@ head .
he is a le@@ pro@@ us man , he is un@@ clean : the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him ut@@ ter@@ ly un@@ clean ; his pla@@ gue is in his head .
and the le@@ per in whom the pla@@ gue is , his clo@@ th@@ es shall be rent , and his head b@@ are , and he shall put a covering upon his up@@ per li@@ p , and shall cry , Un@@ clean , un@@ clean .
all the days where@@ in the pla@@ gue shall be in him he shall be def@@ iled ; he is un@@ clean : he shall d@@ well alone ; without the camp shall his habi@@ tation be .

he shall therefore bur@@ n that gar@@ ment , whether war@@ p or wo@@ of , in wo@@ ol@@ len or in lin@@ en , or any thing of s@@ kin , where@@ in the pla@@ gue is : for it is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy ; it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .
then the pri@@ est shall command that they was@@ h the thing where@@ in the pla@@ gue is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and if it appear still in the gar@@ ment , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of s@@ kin ; it is a spreading pla@@ gue : th@@ ou s@@ halt bur@@ n that where@@ in the pla@@ gue is with fire .
this shall be the law of the le@@ per in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and the pri@@ est shall go forth out of the camp ; and the pri@@ est shall look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy be he@@ aled in the le@@ per ;
then shall the pri@@ est command to take for him that is to be cleans@@ ed two birds alive and clean , and c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and scar@@ let , and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p :

and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le upon him that is to be cleans@@ ed from the le@@ pro@@ sy seven times , and shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and the pri@@ est that mak@@ eth him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and the pri@@ est shall take one he lam@@ b , and offer him for a t@@ res@@ pass offering , and the lo@@ g of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord :

and the pri@@ est shall offer the sin offering , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for him that is to be cleans@@ ed from his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess ; and after@@ ward he shall kill the bur@@ n@@ t offering :
and the pri@@ est shall offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the meat offering upon the alt@@ ar : and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him , and he shall be clean .
and two tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing un@@ to the pri@@ est , un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , before the Lord .
and the pri@@ est shall take the lam@@ b of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and the lo@@ g of oil , and the pri@@ est shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord :

and the rest of the oil that is in the pri@@ est 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord .
this is the law of him in whom is the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , whose hand is not able to get that which per@@ tain@@ eth to his cleansing .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , saying ,
when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that ow@@ net@@ h the house shall come and tell the pri@@ est , saying , It se@@ eme@@ th to me there is as it were a pla@@ gue in the house :
then the pri@@ est shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days :
and the pri@@ est shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be spread in the walls of the house ;
then the pri@@ est shall command that they take away the stones in which the pla@@ gue is , and they shall cast them into an un@@ clean place without the city :
and he shall cause the house to be sc@@ ra@@ ped within round about , and they shall p@@ our out the d@@ ust that they scrap@@ e off without the city into an un@@ clean place :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mor@@ ter , and shall pla@@ ister the house .
and if the pla@@ gue come again , and break out in the house , after that he hat@@ h taken away the stones , and after he hat@@ h sc@@ ra@@ ped the house , and after it is pla@@ ist@@ ered ;
then the pri@@ est shall come and look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be spread in the house , it is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy in the house : it is un@@ clean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , and all the mor@@ ter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an un@@ clean place .
moreover he that go@@ eth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that li@@ eth in the house shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he that e@@ ate@@ th in the house shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es .
and he shall kill the one of the birds in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel over running water :
but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for the house : and it shall be clean .
this is the law for all manner of pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , and sc@@ all ,
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , saying ,
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When any man hat@@ h a running issue out of his f@@ les@@ h , because of his issue he is un@@ clean .
and this shall be his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in his issue : whether his f@@ les@@ h run with his issue , or his f@@ les@@ h be stopped from his issue , it is his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .

and the ves@@ sel of ear@@ th , that he tou@@ ch@@ eth which hat@@ h the issue , shall be broken : and every ves@@ sel of wood shall be rin@@ sed in water .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , and come before the Lord un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and give them un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and the pri@@ est shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering ; and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him before the Lord for his issue .
and if any man 's se@@ ed of cop@@ ulation go out from him , then he shall was@@ h all his f@@ les@@ h in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and every gar@@ ment , and every s@@ kin , where@@ on is the se@@ ed of cop@@ ulation , shall be was@@ hed with water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
the woman also with whom man shall lie with se@@ ed of cop@@ ulation , they shall both ba@@ the themselves in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her f@@ les@@ h be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth her shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and every thing that she li@@ eth upon in her separation shall be un@@ clean : every thing also that she sit@@ te@@ th upon shall be un@@ clean .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth her bed shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth any thing that she sat upon shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and if it be on her bed , or on any thing where@@ on she sit@@ te@@ th , when he tou@@ ch@@ eth it , he shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be un@@ clean seven days ; and all the bed where@@ on he li@@ eth shall be un@@ clean .
every bed where@@ on she li@@ eth all the days of her issue shall be un@@ to her as the bed of her separation : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she sit@@ te@@ th upon shall be un@@ clean , as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of her separation .

but if she be cleans@@ ed of her issue , then she shall number to her@@ self seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
and on the eighth day she shall take un@@ to her two tur@@ t@@ les , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , and bring them un@@ to the pri@@ est , to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess ; that they die not in their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess , when they def@@ ile my tab@@ ern@@ acle that is among them .
thus shall Aaron come into the hol@@ y place : with a young bul@@ lock for a sin offering , and a ram for a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and Aaron shall offer his bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house .
and he shall take the two go@@ ats , and present them before the Lord at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two go@@ ats ; one lot for the Lord , and the other lot for the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at .
and Aaron shall bring the go@@ at upon which the Lord 's lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
but the go@@ at , on which the lot fell to be the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement with him , and to let him go for a s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Aaron shall bring the bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bul@@ lock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a cen@@ ser full of burning co@@ als of fire from off the alt@@ ar before the Lord , and his hands full of swe@@ et incen@@ se beaten small , and bring it within the v@@ ail :
and he shall put the incen@@ se upon the fire before the Lord , that the cl@@ oud of the incen@@ se may cover the mer@@ cy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
and he shall take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le it with his fin@@ ger upon the mer@@ cy seat eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and before the mer@@ cy seat shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood with his fin@@ ger seven times .
and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood upon it with his fin@@ ger seven times , and cleans@@ e it , and hal@@ low it from the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of the children of Israel .
and when he hat@@ h made an end of reconc@@ iling the hol@@ y place , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the alt@@ ar , he shall bring the live go@@ at :
and the go@@ at shall bear upon him all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities un@@ to a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the go@@ at in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Aaron shall come into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall put off the lin@@ en gar@@ ments , which he put on when he went into the hol@@ y place , and shall leave them there :
and the f@@ at of the sin offering shall he bur@@ n upon the alt@@ ar .
and he that let go the go@@ at for the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward come into the camp .
and he that bur@@ net@@ h them shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp .
for on that day shall the pri@@ est make an At@@ on@@ ement for you , to cleans@@ e you , that ye may be clean from all your sin@@ s before the Lord .
speak un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to his sons , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them ; This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying ,
what man so@@ ever there be of the house of Israel , that kil@@ le@@ th an o@@ x , or lam@@ b , or go@@ at , in the camp , or that kil@@ le@@ th it out of the camp ,
and the pri@@ est shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the blood upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and bur@@ n the f@@ at for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and they shall no more offer their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es un@@ to dev@@ ils , after whom they have gone a wh@@ oring . this shall be a statute for ever un@@ to them throughout their generations .
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer it un@@ to the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
therefore I said un@@ to the children of Israel , No sou@@ l of you shall eat blood , neither shall any st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among you eat blood .
but if he was@@ h them not , nor ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h ; then he shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .

Y@@ e shall do my judg@@ ments , and keep mine ord@@ inan@@ ces , to walk there@@ in : I am the Lord your God .
Y@@ e shall therefore keep my stat@@ utes , and my judg@@ ments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : I am the Lord .
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to un@@ cover their nak@@ edn@@ ess : I am the Lord .

neither s@@ halt th@@ ou lie with any be@@ ast to def@@ ile th@@ y@@ self there@@ with : neither shall any woman stand before a be@@ ast to lie down there@@ to : it is conf@@ usion .
Def@@ ile not ye yo@@ ur@@ selves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are def@@ iled which I cast out before you :
and the land is def@@ iled : therefore I do visit the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity there@@ of upon it , and the land itself v@@ om@@ ite@@ th out her inhabitants .
( for all these ab@@ omin@@ ations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is def@@ iled ; )
that the land sp@@ ue not you out also , when ye def@@ ile it , as it sp@@ u@@ ed out the nations that were before you .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall commit any of these ab@@ omin@@ ations , even the so@@ ul@@ s that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
speak un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Y@@ e shall be hol@@ y : for I the Lord your God am hol@@ y .

and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , ye shall offer it at your own will .
and if it be e@@ aten at all on the third day , it is ab@@ omin@@ able ; it shall not be accepted .
therefore every one that e@@ ate@@ th it shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because he hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ low@@ ed thing of the Lord : and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not wh@@ ol@@ ly re@@ ap the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est .

and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit there@@ of , that it may yield un@@ to you the increase there@@ of : I am the Lord your God .
Y@@ e shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use en@@ chan@@ tment , nor observe times .

T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt rise up before the ho@@ ary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear TH@@ Y God : I am the Lord .
just balan@@ ces , just we@@ ights , a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he gi@@ vet@@ h of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch , and kill him not :
San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore , and be ye hol@@ y : for I am the Lord your God .
for every one that cur@@ set@@ h his father or his mother shall be su@@ rely put to death : he hat@@ h Cur@@ sed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery with another man 's wife , even he that commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery with his neighbour 's wife , the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ er and the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ess shall su@@ rely be put to death .
and the man that li@@ eth with his father 's wife hat@@ h uncovered his father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess : both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death : they have w@@ rought conf@@ usion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with man@@ kind , as he li@@ eth with a woman , both of them have committed an ab@@ omin@@ ation : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt not un@@ cover the nak@@ edn@@ ess of TH@@ Y mother 's sister , nor of TH@@ Y father 's sister : for he un@@ cover@@ eth his near kin : they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an un@@ clean thing : he hat@@ h uncovered his brother 's nak@@ edn@@ ess ; they shall be ch@@ ild@@ less .
Y@@ e shall therefore keep all my stat@@ utes , and all my judg@@ ments , and do them : that the land , w@@ hi@@ ther I bring you to d@@ well there@@ in , sp@@ ue you not out .
and ye shall not walk in the man@@ ners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I ab@@ hor@@ red them .
and ye shall be hol@@ y un@@ to me : for I the Lord am hol@@ y , and have sever@@ ed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
a man also or woman that hat@@ h a familiar spirit , or that is a w@@ iz@@ ard , shall su@@ rely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
and for his sister a vir@@ gin , that is n@@ igh un@@ to him , which hat@@ h had no husband ; for her may he be def@@ iled .
but he shall not def@@ ile himself , being a chief man among his people , to prof@@ ane himself .
they shall not make bal@@ d@@ ness upon their head , neither shall they s@@ have off the cor@@ ner of their be@@ ard , nor make any cut@@ t@@ ings in their f@@ les@@ h .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is hol@@ y un@@ to his God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt sanc@@ ti@@ fy him therefore ; for he offer@@ eth the bread of TH@@ Y God : he shall be hol@@ y un@@ to the@@ e : for I the Lord , which sanc@@ ti@@ fy you , am hol@@ y .
and the daughter of any pri@@ est , if she prof@@ ane her@@ self by playing the wh@@ ore , she prof@@ an@@ eth her father : she shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire .
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor def@@ ile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
neither shall he go out of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , nor prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of his God ; for the cro@@ wn of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
a wi@@ dow , or a div@@ or@@ ced woman , or prof@@ ane , or an har@@ lot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a vir@@ gin of his own people to wife .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man he be that hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , he shall not approach : a b@@ lin@@ d man , or a la@@ me , or he that hat@@ h a flat n@@ ose , or any thing super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous ,

that which di@@ eth of itself , or is torn with be@@ asts , he shall not eat to def@@ ile himself there@@ with : I am the Lord .
they shall therefore keep mine ordin@@ ance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they prof@@ ane it : I the Lord do sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
there shall no st@@ ran@@ ger eat of the hol@@ y thing : a so@@ jour@@ ner of the pri@@ est , or an hired ser@@ vant , shall not eat of the hol@@ y thing .
but if the pri@@ est buy any sou@@ l with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the pri@@ est 's daughter also be married un@@ to a st@@ ran@@ ger , she may not eat of an offering of the hol@@ y things .
and if a man eat of the hol@@ y thing un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , then he shall put the fifth part there@@ of un@@ to it , and shall give it un@@ to the pri@@ est with the hol@@ y thing .
and they shall not prof@@ ane the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , which they offer un@@ to the Lord ;
Y@@ e shall offer at your own will a male without ble@@ mis@@ h , of the be@@ ev@@ es , of the she@@ ep , or of the go@@ ats .
but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
b@@ lin@@ d , or broken , or ma@@ imed , or having a W@@ en , or s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , ye shall not offer these un@@ to the Lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord .
either a bul@@ lock or a lam@@ b that hat@@ h any thing super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous or lacking in his parts , that may@@ est th@@ ou offer for a fre@@ e@@ will offering ; but for a vo@@ w it shall not be accepted .
Y@@ e shall not offer un@@ to the Lord that which is bru@@ ised , or cr@@ us@@ hed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering there@@ of in your land .
and whether it be cow or e@@ we , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day .
and when ye will offer a sacrifice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving un@@ to the Lord , offer it at your own will .
on the same day it shall be e@@ aten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the mor@@ row : I am the Lord .
neither shall ye prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name ; but I will be hal@@ low@@ ed among the children of Israel : I am the Lord which hal@@ low you ,
that brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , concerning the fe@@ asts of the Lord , which ye shall procla@@ im to be hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ations , even these are my fe@@ asts .
these are the fe@@ asts of the Lord , even hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ations , which ye shall procla@@ im in their se@@ as@@ ons .
and on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same month is the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread un@@ to the Lord : seven days ye must eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread .
in the first day ye shall have an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord seven days : in the seventh day is an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .
and he shall wave the she@@ af before the Lord , to be accepted for you : on the mor@@ row after the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath the pri@@ est shall wave it .
and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the she@@ af an he lam@@ b without ble@@ mis@@ h of the first year for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor par@@ ched cor@@ n , nor green e@@ ars , until the sel@@ f@@ same day that ye have brought an offering un@@ to your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your d@@ wel@@ lings .
and ye shall count un@@ to you from the mor@@ row after the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , from the day that ye brought the she@@ af of the wave offering ; seven sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths shall be complete :
even un@@ to the mor@@ row after the seventh sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall ye number fif@@ ty days ; and ye shall offer a new meat offering un@@ to the Lord .
Y@@ e shall bring out of your habi@@ tations two wave lo@@ aves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine fl@@ our ; they shall be bak@@ en with le@@ av@@ en ; they are the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its un@@ to the Lord .
then ye shall sacrifice one k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering , and two lam@@ bs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , a memorial of b@@ low@@ ing of tr@@ ump@@ ets , an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation .
Y@@ e shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in : but ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of At@@ on@@ ement , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you before the Lord your God .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that shall not be aff@@ lic@@ ted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .

Y@@ e shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your d@@ wel@@ lings .

bes@@ ide the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths of the Lord , and bes@@ ide your gifts , and bes@@ ide all your vows , and bes@@ ide all your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , which ye give un@@ to the Lord .
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to d@@ well in bo@@ o@@ ths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
command the children of Israel , that they bring un@@ to the@@ e p@@ ure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lam@@ ps to bur@@ n continu@@ ally .
without the v@@ ail of the testimony , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , shall Aaron order it from the evening un@@ to the morning before the Lord continu@@ ally : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set them in two ro@@ ws , six on a row , upon the p@@ ure table before the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put p@@ ure fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and the son of an Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman and a man of Israel stro@@ ve together in the camp ;
and they put him in ward , that the mind of the Lord might be she@@ wed them .
bring forth him that hat@@ h Cur@@ sed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the Con@@ gre@@ gation stone him .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever cur@@ set@@ h his God shall bear his sin .
and if a man cause a ble@@ mis@@ h in his neighbour ; as he hat@@ h done , so shall it be done to him ;

and he that kil@@ le@@ th a be@@ ast , he shall restore it : and he that kil@@ le@@ th a man , he shall be put to death .
Y@@ e shall have one manner of law , as well for the st@@ ran@@ ger , as for one of your own country : for I am the Lord your God .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath un@@ to the Lord .
six years th@@ ou s@@ halt so@@ w TH@@ Y field , and six years th@@ ou s@@ halt pr@@ un@@ e TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , and gather in the fruit there@@ of ;

then s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the tr@@ ump@@ et of the j@@ ub@@ ile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of At@@ on@@ ement shall ye make the tr@@ ump@@ et sound throughout all your land .
a j@@ ub@@ ile shall that fif@@ ti@@ eth year be un@@ to you : ye shall not so@@ w , neither re@@ ap that which grow@@ eth of itself in it , nor gather the grap@@ es in it of TH@@ Y v@@ ine und@@ ressed .
for it is the j@@ ub@@ ile ; it shall be hol@@ y un@@ to you : ye shall eat the increase there@@ of out of the field .
and if th@@ ou sell ought un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour , or buy@@ est ought of TH@@ Y neighbour 's hand , ye shall not op@@ press one another :
according to the number of years after the j@@ ub@@ ile th@@ ou s@@ halt buy of TH@@ Y neighbour , and according un@@ to the number of years of the fru@@ its he shall sell un@@ to the@@ e :
Y@@ e shall not therefore op@@ press one another ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt fear TH@@ Y God : for I am the Lord your God .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ye shall do my stat@@ utes , and keep my judg@@ ments , and do them ; and ye shall d@@ well in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield her fruit , and he shall eat your fill , and d@@ well there@@ in in safety .
and if ye shall say , What shall we eat the seventh year ? be@@ hold , we shall not so@@ w , nor gather in our increase :
then I will command my b@@ les@@ sing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
and ye shall so@@ w the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fru@@ its come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are st@@ ran@@ gers and so@@ jour@@ ners with me .
if TH@@ Y brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and hat@@ h sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to re@@ de@@ em it , then shall he re@@ de@@ em that which his brother sold .
then let him count the years of the sale there@@ of , and restore the over@@ plus un@@ to the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return un@@ to his possession .

no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the L@@ evi@@ tes re@@ de@@ em at any time .

T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not give him TH@@ Y money upon us@@ ury , nor lend him TH@@ Y vic@@ tuals for increase .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and to be your God .
and if TH@@ Y brother that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th by the@@ e be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and be sold un@@ to the@@ e ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not comp@@ el him to serve as a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant :

for they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bon@@ d@@ men .
both TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ men , and TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , shall be of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bon@@ d@@ men and bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids .

and if he be not re@@ deemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of j@@ ub@@ ile , both he , and his children with him .
for un@@ to me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and your th@@ res@@ hing shall reach un@@ to the vin@@ t@@ age , and the vin@@ t@@ age shall reach un@@ to the so@@ wing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and d@@ well in your land saf@@ ely .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid ev@@ il be@@ asts out of the land , neither shall the s@@ word go through your land .
and ye shall ch@@ ase your enem@@ ies , and they shall fall before you by the s@@ word .
and five of you shall ch@@ ase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enem@@ ies shall fall before you by the s@@ word .
for I will have respect un@@ to you , and make you fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply you , and establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you .
and I will set my tab@@ ern@@ acle among you : and my sou@@ l shall not ab@@ h@@ or you .
and I will walk among you , and will be your God , and ye shall be my people .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bon@@ d@@ men ; and I have broken the bands of your yok@@ e , and made you go u@@ pri@@ ght .
and if ye shall desp@@ ise my stat@@ utes , or if your sou@@ l ab@@ h@@ or my judg@@ ments , so that ye will not do all my comman@@ d@@ ments , but that ye break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and I will set my face against you , and ye shall be sla@@ in before your enem@@ ies : they that h@@ ate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursu@@ eth you .
and if ye will not yet for all this he@@ arken un@@ to me , then I will punish you seven times more for your sin@@ s .
and I will break the pride of your power ; and I will make your heav@@ en as iron , and your ear@@ th as br@@ ass :
and your strength shall be spent in v@@ ain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fru@@ its .
and if ye walk contrary un@@ to me , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to me ; I will bring seven times more plagu@@ es upon you according to your sin@@ s .
I will also send wild be@@ asts among you , which shall ro@@ b you of your children , and destroy your c@@ attle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be de@@ so@@ late .
and if ye will not be re@@ formed by me by these things , but will walk contrary un@@ to me ;
then will I also walk contrary un@@ to you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sin@@ s .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bak@@ e your bread in one ov@@ en , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
then I will walk contrary un@@ to you also in fur@@ y ; and I , even I , will ch@@ as@@ tise you seven times for your sin@@ s .
and ye shall eat the f@@ les@@ h of your sons , and the f@@ les@@ h of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your car@@ cases upon the car@@ cases of your id@@ ols , and my sou@@ l shall ab@@ h@@ or you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanc@@ tu@@ aries un@@ to de@@ so@@ lation , and I will not s@@ me@@ ll the sav@@ our of your swe@@ et o@@ do@@ urs .
and I will bring the land into de@@ so@@ lation : and your enem@@ ies which d@@ well there@@ in shall be ast@@ on@@ ished at it .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter you among the he@@ a@@ then , and will draw out a s@@ word after you : and your land shall be de@@ so@@ late , and your cities waste .
then shall the land enjoy her sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , as long as it li@@ eth de@@ so@@ late , and ye be in your enem@@ ies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths .
as long as it li@@ eth de@@ so@@ late it shall rest ; because it did not rest in your sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , when ye d@@ wel@@ t upon it .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a s@@ word , when none pursu@@ eth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enem@@ ies .
and ye shall per@@ ish among the he@@ a@@ then , and the land of your enem@@ ies shall eat you up .
and they that are left of you shall p@@ ine away in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in your enem@@ ies ' lands ; and also in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fa@@ thers shall they p@@ ine away with them .
if they shall conf@@ ess their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of their fa@@ thers , with their t@@ res@@ pass which they t@@ res@@ passed against me , and that also they have walked contrary un@@ to me ;
and that I also have walked contrary un@@ to them , and have brought them into the land of their enem@@ ies ; if then their un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised hear@@ ts be hum@@ b@@ led , and they then accept of the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity :
then will I remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Jac@@ o@@ b , and also my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with I@@ sa@@ ac , and also my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Ab@@ ra@@ ham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
but I will for their sak@@ es remember the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of their an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , that I might be their God : I am the Lord .
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments and laws , which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount S@@ ina@@ i by the hand of Mos@@ es .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When a man shall make a sin@@ gular vo@@ w , the persons shall be for the Lord by TH@@ Y esti@@ mation .
and TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be of the male from twenty years old even un@@ to six@@ ty years old , even TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .

but if he be poo@@ rer than TH@@ Y esti@@ mation , then he shall present himself before the pri@@ est , and the pri@@ est shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the pri@@ est value him .
and if it be a be@@ ast , where@@ of men bring an offering un@@ to the Lord , all that any man gi@@ vet@@ h of such un@@ to the Lord shall be hol@@ y .
and if it be any un@@ clean be@@ ast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice un@@ to the Lord , then he shall present the be@@ ast before the pri@@ est :
and the pri@@ est shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as th@@ ou valu@@ est it , who art the pri@@ est , so shall it be .
and when a man shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy his house to be hol@@ y un@@ to the Lord , then the pri@@ est shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the pri@@ est shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
and if he that sanc@@ ti@@ fied it will re@@ de@@ em his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of TH@@ Y esti@@ mation un@@ to it , and it shall be his .

and all TH@@ Y esti@@ m@@ ations shall be according to the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : twenty ger@@ ah@@ s shall be the sh@@ ek@@ el .
none devoted , which shall be devoted of men , shall be re@@ deemed ; but shall su@@ rely be put to death .
and all the ti@@ the of the land , whether of the se@@ ed of the land , or of the fruit of the tree , is the Lord 's : it is hol@@ y un@@ to the Lord .
and if a man will at all re@@ de@@ em ought of his ti@@ th@@ es , he shall add there@@ to the fifth part there@@ of .
and concerning the ti@@ the of the her@@ d , or of the flock , even of wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever pass@@ eth under the ro@@ d , the tenth shall be hol@@ y un@@ to the Lord .

from thirty years old and up@@ ward until fif@@ ty years old s@@ halt th@@ ou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their bur@@ den@@ s , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint un@@ to them in charge all their bur@@ den@@ s .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and their charge shall be under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
as for the sons of Mer@@ ari , th@@ ou s@@ halt number them after their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers ;
from thirty years old and up@@ ward even un@@ to fif@@ ty years old s@@ halt th@@ ou number them , every one that enter@@ eth into the service , to do the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty .
even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Mer@@ ari , throughout their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers ,
even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them after their families , were three thousand and two hundred .
these be those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Mer@@ ari , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron num@@ ber@@ ed according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score .
command the children of Israel , that they put out of the camp every le@@ per , and every one that hat@@ h an issue , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever is def@@ iled by the dead :
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they def@@ ile not their camps , in the mid@@ st where@@ of I d@@ well .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall conf@@ ess their sin which they have done : and he shall re@@ compen@@ se his t@@ res@@ pass with the principal there@@ of , and add un@@ to it the fifth part there@@ of , and give it un@@ to him against whom he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed .
and every offering of all the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , which they bring un@@ to the pri@@ est , shall be his .
and every man 's hal@@ low@@ ed things shall be his : wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever any man gi@@ vet@@ h the pri@@ est , it shall be his .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a t@@ res@@ pass against him ,
and the pri@@ est shall take hol@@ y water in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel ; and of the d@@ ust that is in the floor of the tab@@ ern@@ acle the pri@@ est shall take , and put it into the water :
but if th@@ ou h@@ ast gone aside to another instead of TH@@ Y husband , and if th@@ ou be def@@ iled , and some man have la@@ in with the@@ e bes@@ ide th@@ ine husband :
and this water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se shall go into TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , to make TH@@ Y bel@@ ly to s@@ well , and TH@@ Y th@@ igh to ro@@ t : and the woman shall say , A@@ men , amen .
and the pri@@ est shall write these cur@@ ses in a book , and he shall blo@@ t them out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se : and the water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the pri@@ est shall take the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the alt@@ ar :
and the pri@@ est shall take an hand@@ ful of the offering , even the memorial there@@ of , and bur@@ n it upon the alt@@ ar , and after@@ ward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not def@@ iled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conce@@ ive se@@ ed .
this is the law of je@@ al@@ ou@@ sies , when a wife go@@ eth aside to another instead of her husband , and is def@@ iled ;
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the v@@ ine tree , from the ker@@ n@@ els even to the hus@@ k .
all the days that he separ@@ ate@@ th himself un@@ to the Lord he shall come at no dead body .
he shall not make himself un@@ clean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consec@@ ration of his God is upon his head .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two tur@@ t@@ les , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , to the pri@@ est , to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and the pri@@ est shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate un@@ to the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lam@@ b of the first year for a t@@ res@@ pass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was def@@ iled .
and this is the law of the N@@ azar@@ ite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and a bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , cak@@ es of fine fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with oil , and w@@ af@@ ers of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ano@@ in@@ ted with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offer@@ ings .
and the pri@@ est shall bring them before the Lord , and shall offer his sin offering , and his bur@@ n@@ t offering :
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , with the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : the pri@@ est shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the pri@@ est shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord : this is hol@@ y for the pri@@ est , with the wave bre@@ ast and he@@ ave sho@@ ul@@ der : and after that the N@@ azar@@ ite may drink wine .
speak un@@ to Aaron and un@@ to his sons , saying , On this wise ye shall b@@ less the children of Israel , saying un@@ to them ,
the Lord make his face sh@@ ine upon the@@ e , and be gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the@@ e :
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying ,
and Mos@@ es took the w@@ ag@@ ons and the ox@@ en , and gave them un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes .
two w@@ ag@@ ons and four ox@@ en he gave un@@ to the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , according to their service :
and four w@@ ag@@ ons and eight ox@@ en he gave un@@ to the sons of Mer@@ ari , according un@@ to their service , under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
but un@@ to the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h he gave none : because the service of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary belonging un@@ to them was that they should bear upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and the pr@@ inces offered for dedic@@ ating of the alt@@ ar in the day that it was ano@@ in@@ ted , even the pr@@ inces offered their offering before the alt@@ ar .
and he that offered his offering the first day was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h :
on the second day N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the son of Zu@@ ar , pr@@ ince of Is@@ sac@@ har , did offer :

on the seventh day E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud , pr@@ ince of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , offered :

on the eighth day offered G@@ am@@ ali@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ah@@ z@@ ur , pr@@ ince of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h :

on the tenth day A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i , pr@@ ince of the children of Dan , offered :
and for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he go@@ ats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i .
on the ele@@ venth day P@@ ag@@ i@@ el the son of O@@ cr@@ an , pr@@ ince of the children of As@@ her , offered :
and for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he go@@ ats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of P@@ ag@@ i@@ el the son of O@@ cr@@ an .
on the twel@@ f@@ th day Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an , pr@@ ince of the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , offered :
and for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he go@@ ats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an .
this was the dedic@@ ation of the alt@@ ar , in the day when it was ano@@ in@@ ted , by the pr@@ inces of Israel : twelve char@@ gers of silver , twelve silver bo@@ w@@ ls , twelve sp@@ o@@ ons of gold :
each char@@ ger of silver weigh@@ ing an hundred and thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , each bo@@ w@@ l sev@@ enty : all the silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
the golden sp@@ o@@ ons were twelve , full of incen@@ se , weigh@@ ing ten sh@@ ek@@ els ap@@ i@@ ece , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : all the gold of the sp@@ o@@ ons was an hundred and twenty sh@@ ek@@ els .
all the ox@@ en for the bur@@ n@@ t offering were twelve bul@@ loc@@ ks , the r@@ ams twelve , the lam@@ bs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the go@@ ats for sin offering twelve .
speak un@@ to Aaron , and say un@@ to him , When th@@ ou ligh@@ test the lam@@ ps , the seven lam@@ ps shall give light over against the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and Aaron did so ; he ligh@@ ted the lam@@ ps there@@ of over against the cand@@ le@@ stick , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and this work of the cand@@ le@@ stick was of beaten gold , un@@ to the S@@ haf@@ t there@@ of , un@@ to the flowers there@@ of , was beaten work : according un@@ to the pat@@ tern which the Lord had she@@ wed Mos@@ es , so he made the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to them , to cleans@@ e them : sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le water of pur@@ ifying upon them , and let them s@@ have all their f@@ les@@ h , and let them was@@ h their clo@@ th@@ es , and so make themselves clean .
then let them take a young bul@@ lock with his meat offering , even fine fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with oil , and another young bul@@ lock s@@ halt th@@ ou take for a sin offering .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the L@@ evi@@ tes before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and th@@ ou s@@ halt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the L@@ evi@@ tes before the Lord : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and Aaron shall offer the L@@ evi@@ tes before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may exec@@ ute the service of the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the L@@ evi@@ tes before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering un@@ to the Lord .
thus s@@ halt th@@ ou separate the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be mine .
and after that shall the L@@ evi@@ tes go in to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and th@@ ou s@@ halt cleans@@ e them , and offer them for an offering .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given un@@ to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every w@@ om@@ b , even instead of the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , have I taken them un@@ to me .
for all the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel are mine , both man and be@@ ast : on the day that I smo@@ te every fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt I sanc@@ ti@@ fied them for myself .
and I have taken the L@@ evi@@ tes for all the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified , and they was@@ hed their clo@@ th@@ es ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord ; and Aaron made an At@@ on@@ ement for them to cleans@@ e them .
this is it that belon@@ get@@ h un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes : from twenty and five years old and up@@ ward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and from the age of fif@@ ty years they shall ce@@ ase waiting upon the service there@@ of , and shall serve no more :
but shall minister with their bre@@ th@@ ren in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes tou@@ ching their charge .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , that they should keep the pass@@ over .
and they kept the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the first month at even in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i : according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so did the children of Israel .
and there were certain men , who were def@@ iled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pass@@ over on that day : and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said un@@ to him , We are def@@ iled by the dead body of a man : where@@ fore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month at even they shall keep it , and eat it with un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread and bitter her@@ bs .
they shall leave none of it un@@ to the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the pass@@ over they shall keep it .
and on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , name@@ ly , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
so it was al@@ way : the cl@@ oud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cl@@ oud abo@@ de , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their ten@@ ts .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they pit@@ ched : as long as the cl@@ oud abo@@ de upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle they rested in their ten@@ ts .
and when the cl@@ oud tar@@ ried long upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not .
and so it was , when the cl@@ oud was a few days upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they rested in the ten@@ ts , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
make the@@ e two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver ; of a whole piece s@@ halt th@@ ou make them : that th@@ ou may@@ est use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
and when they shall blow with them , all the assembly shall assem@@ ble themselves to the@@ e at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and if they blow but with one tr@@ ump@@ et , then the pr@@ inces , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves un@@ to the@@ e .
when ye blow an alarm , then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their jour@@ neys .
but when the Con@@ gre@@ gation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not sound an alarm .
and the sons of Aaron , the pri@@ ests , shall blow with the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and they shall be to you for an ordin@@ ance for ever throughout your generations .
and it came to pass on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
and the children of Israel took their jour@@ neys out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i ; and the cl@@ oud rested in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an .
and they first took their journey according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their armies : and over his host was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har was N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the son of Zu@@ ar .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Ze@@ bul@@ un was Eli@@ a@@ b the son of Hel@@ on .
and the tab@@ ern@@ acle was taken down ; and the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on and the sons of Mer@@ ari set forward , bearing the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the standard of the camp of Re@@ ub@@ en set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Eli@@ z@@ ur the son of S@@ hede@@ ur .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of G@@ ad was Eli@@ as@@ ap@@ h the son of De@@ uel .
and the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites set forward , bearing the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : and the other did set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle against they came .
and the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies : and over his host was E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was G@@ am@@ ali@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ah@@ z@@ ur .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin was A@@ bi@@ dan the son of G@@ ide@@ oni .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her was P@@ ag@@ i@@ el the son of O@@ cr@@ an .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i was Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an .
thus were the jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and he said , Le@@ ave us not , I pra@@ y the@@ e ; for@@ as@@ much as th@@ ou know@@ est how we are to en@@ camp in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and th@@ ou may@@ est be to us instead of eyes .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou go with us , ye@@ a , it shall be , that what Go@@ od@@ ness the Lord shall do un@@ to us , the same will we do un@@ to the@@ e .
and they depar@@ ted from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the cl@@ oud of the Lord was upon them by day , when they went out of the camp .
and it came to pass , when the Ar@@ k set forward , that Mos@@ es said , R@@ ise up , Lord , and let th@@ ine enem@@ ies be sc@@ at@@ tered ; and let them that h@@ ate the@@ e flee before the@@ e .
and the people cri@@ ed un@@ to Mos@@ es ; and when Mos@@ es pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the fire was qu@@ en@@ ched .
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the gar@@ lick :
and the man@@ na was as cor@@ i@@ ander se@@ ed , and the col@@ our there@@ of as the col@@ our of b@@ del@@ li@@ um .
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the man@@ na fell upon it .
then Mos@@ es heard the people we@@ ep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led greatly ; Mos@@ es also was disp@@ le@@ ased .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the Lord , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou aff@@ lic@@ ted TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ? and where@@ fore have I not found favour in TH@@ Y sight , that th@@ ou lay@@ est the burden of all this people upon me ?
Wh@@ ence should I have f@@ les@@ h to give un@@ to all this people ? for they we@@ ep un@@ to me , saying , Gi@@ ve us f@@ les@@ h , that we may eat .
I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
and if th@@ ou deal thus with me , kill me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of hand , if I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight ; and let me not see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess .
Y@@ e shall not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ;
shall the f@@ loc@@ ks and the her@@ ds be sla@@ in for them , to su@@ ffic@@ e them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to su@@ ffic@@ e them ?
and Mos@@ es went out , and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the people , and set them round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of Mos@@ es , one of his young men , answ@@ ered and said , My lor@@ d Mos@@ es , for@@ bid them .
and Mos@@ es g@@ at him into the camp , he and the el@@ ders of Israel .
and while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , ER@@ E it was che@@ wed , the wr@@ ath of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and the Lord smo@@ te the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am and Aaron sp@@ ake against Mos@@ es because of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian woman .
( now the man Mos@@ es was very me@@ ek , above all the men which were upon the face of the ear@@ th . )
and the Lord sp@@ ake su@@ d@@ den@@ ly un@@ to Mos@@ es , and un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to Mi@@ ri@@ am , C@@ ome out ye three un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation . and they three came out .
and the Lord came down in the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even apparently , and not in dark spe@@ eches ; and the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of the Lord shall he be@@ hold : where@@ fore then were ye not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant Mos@@ es ?
and the cl@@ oud depar@@ ted from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; and , be@@ hold , Mi@@ ri@@ am became le@@ pro@@ us , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Mi@@ ri@@ am , and , be@@ hold , she was le@@ pro@@ us .
let her not be as one dead , of whom the f@@ les@@ h is half consu@@ med when he co@@ me@@ th out of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am was shut out from the camp seven days : and the people jour@@ ne@@ yed not ti@@ ll Mi@@ ri@@ am was brought in again .
and Mos@@ es by the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord sent them from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an : all those men were heads of the children of Israel .
and these were their names : of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , Sh@@ am@@ mu@@ a the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur .
of the tri@@ be of Simeon , Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of H@@ ori .
of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h .
of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Os@@ he@@ a the son of nun .
of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , Pal@@ ti the son of Rap@@ hu .
of the tri@@ be of Joseph , name@@ ly , of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Gad@@ di the son of Sus@@ i .
of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , N@@ ah@@ bi the son of V@@ oph@@ si .
of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , Ge@@ uel the son of Mac@@ hi .
these are the names of the men which Mos@@ es sent to sp@@ y out the land . and Mos@@ es called Os@@ he@@ a the son of nun J@@ eh@@ os@@ hua .
and Mos@@ es sent them to sp@@ y out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said un@@ to them , G@@ et you up this way sou@@ th@@ ward , and go up into the mountain :
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they d@@ well in , whether in ten@@ ts , or in strong holds ;
so they went up , and searched the land from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ b , as men come to Ham@@ ath .
and they as@@ cen@@ ded by the south , and came un@@ to He@@ br@@ on ; where Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
and they came un@@ to the Bro@@ ok of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from th@@ ence a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ are it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and of the fig@@ s .
the place was called the Bro@@ ok E@@ sh@@ col , because of the cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es which the children of Israel cut down from th@@ ence .
and they told him , and said , We came un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou sen@@ test us , and su@@ rely it flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey ; and this is the fruit of it .
nevertheless the people be strong that d@@ well in the land , and the cities are wal@@ led , and very great : and moreover we saw the children of An@@ ak there .
and Cal@@ e@@ b sti@@ l@@ led the people before Mos@@ es , and said , Let us go up at once , and poss@@ ess it ; for we are well able to overcome it .
and there we saw the gi@@ ants , the sons of An@@ ak , which come of the gi@@ ants : and we were in our own sight as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , and so we were in their sight .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation lifted up their voice , and cri@@ ed ; and the people we@@ pt that night .
and all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said un@@ to them , Wo@@ uld God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
then Mos@@ es and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clo@@ th@@ es :
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
if the Lord de@@ light in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is depar@@ ted from them , and the Lord is with us : fear them not .
but all the Con@@ gre@@ gation b@@ ade stone them with stones . and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before all the children of Israel .
and now , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , let the power of my Lord be great , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken , saying ,
the Lord is long@@ suffering , and of great mer@@ cy , for@@ giving in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ gres@@ sion , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers upon the children un@@ to the third and fourth generation .
par@@ don , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of this people according un@@ to the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , and as th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ given this people , from Egypt even until now .
su@@ rely they shall not see the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
but my ser@@ vant Cal@@ e@@ b , because he had another spirit with him , and hat@@ h followed me fully , him will I bring into the land where@@ into he went ; and his se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess it .
( now the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t in the val@@ ley . ) To mor@@ row turn you , and get you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way of the Red sea .
say un@@ to them , As truly as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord , as ye have spoken in mine e@@ ars , so will I do to you :
your car@@ cases shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and all that were num@@ ber@@ ed of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , which have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
doub@@ t@@ less ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sw@@ are to make you d@@ well there@@ in , save Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
but your little ones , which ye said should be a pre@@ y , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have desp@@ ised .
but as for you , your car@@ cases , they shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and your children shall w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , and bear your who@@ red@@ oms , until your car@@ cases be was@@ ted in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even for@@ ty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , even for@@ ty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the Lord have said , I will su@@ rely do it un@@ to all this ev@@ il Con@@ gre@@ gation , that are gathered together against me : in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they shall be consu@@ med , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Mos@@ es sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the Con@@ gre@@ gation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up a s@@ lan@@ der upon the land ,
even those men that did bring up the ev@@ il report upon the land , died by the pla@@ gue before the Lord .
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
and Mos@@ es told these say@@ ings un@@ to all the children of Israel : and the people mour@@ ned greatly .
go not up , for the Lord is not among you ; that ye be not s@@ mit@@ ten before your enem@@ ies .
for the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the s@@ word : because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you .
but they pre@@ sumed to go up un@@ to the hill top : nevertheless the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and Mos@@ es , depar@@ ted not out of the camp .
then the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites came down , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites which d@@ wel@@ t in that hill , and smo@@ te them , and dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them , even un@@ to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come into the land of your habi@@ tations , which I give un@@ to you ,
then shall he that offer@@ eth his offering un@@ to the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering s@@ halt th@@ ou prepare with the bur@@ n@@ t offering or sacrifice , for one lam@@ b .
or for a ram , th@@ ou s@@ halt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with the third part of an hin of oil .
and for a drink offering th@@ ou s@@ halt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and when th@@ ou prepar@@ est a bul@@ lock for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vo@@ w , or peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord :
then shall he bring with a bul@@ lock a meat offering of three tenth deals of fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with half an hin of oil .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
thus shall it be done for one bul@@ lock , or for one ram , or for a lam@@ b , or a k@@ id .
according to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and if a st@@ ran@@ ger so@@ jour@@ n with you , or wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordin@@ ance shall be both for you of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and also for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth with you , an ordin@@ ance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the st@@ ran@@ ger be before the Lord .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land w@@ hi@@ ther I bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord .
Y@@ e shall offer up a c@@ ake of the first of your d@@ ough for an he@@ ave offering : as ye do the he@@ ave offering of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , so shall ye he@@ ave it .
of the first of your d@@ ough ye shall give un@@ to the Lord an he@@ ave offering in your generations .
and it shall be for@@ given all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignor@@ ance .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h ignor@@ antly , when he sin@@ net@@ h by ignor@@ ance before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him ; and it shall be for@@ given him .
Y@@ e shall have one law for him that sin@@ net@@ h through ignor@@ ance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them .
but the sou@@ l that do@@ eth ought pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a st@@ ran@@ ger , the same re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
because he hat@@ h desp@@ ised the word of the Lord , and hat@@ h broken his comman@@ d@@ ment , that sou@@ l shall ut@@ ter@@ ly be cut off ; his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be upon him .
and while the children of Israel were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they found a man that gathered sti@@ cks upon the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
and they that found him gathering sti@@ cks brought him un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron , and un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , The man shall be su@@ rely put to death : all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation brought him without the camp , and st@@ oned him with stones , and he died ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord your God .
and Mos@@ es sent to call Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram , the sons of Eli@@ a@@ b : which said , We will not come up :
is it a small thing that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , except th@@ ou make th@@ y@@ self altogether a pr@@ ince over us ?
and Mos@@ es was very wro@@ th , and said un@@ to the Lord , R@@ espec@@ t not th@@ ou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
and take every man his cen@@ ser , and put incen@@ se in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his cen@@ ser , two hundred and fif@@ ty cen@@ s@@ ers ; th@@ ou also , and Aaron , each of you his cen@@ ser .
and they took every man his cen@@ ser , and put fire in them , and laid incen@@ se there@@ on , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation with Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and Kor@@ ah gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation against them un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , saying ,
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying ,
and Mos@@ es rose up and went un@@ to Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram ; and the el@@ ders of Israel followed him .
if these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the vis@@ itation of all men ; then the Lord hat@@ h not sent me .
and it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground cla@@ ve as@@ under that was under them :
and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained un@@ to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
they , and all that ap@@ per@@ tained to them , went down alive into the p@@ it , and the ear@@ th closed upon them : and they per@@ ished from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , L@@ est the ear@@ th sw@@ allow us up also .
and there came out a fire from the Lord , and consu@@ med the two hundred and fif@@ ty men that offered incen@@ se .
speak un@@ to Ele@@ azar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , that he take up the cen@@ s@@ ers out of the burning , and sc@@ at@@ ter th@@ ou the fire yon@@ der ; for they are hal@@ low@@ ed .
but on the mor@@ row all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron , saying , Y@@ e have killed the people of the Lord .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying ,
and Aaron took as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded , and ran into the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ; and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue was begun among the people : and he put on incen@@ se , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the people .
now they that died in the pla@@ gue were fo@@ ur@@ teen thousand and seven hundred , bes@@ ide them that died about the matter of Kor@@ ah .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt write Aaron 's name upon the ro@@ d of L@@ evi : for one ro@@ d shall be for the head of the house of their fa@@ thers .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt lay them up in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's ro@@ d , whom I shall choose , shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , where@@ by they mur@@ mur against you .
and Mos@@ es brought out all the ro@@ ds from before the Lord un@@ to all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his ro@@ d .
and Mos@@ es did so : as the Lord comman@@ ded him , so did he .
and they shall keep TH@@ Y charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come n@@ igh the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the alt@@ ar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the charge of the alt@@ ar : that there be no wr@@ ath any more upon the children of Israel .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken your bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
in the most hol@@ y place s@@ halt th@@ ou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be hol@@ y un@@ to the@@ e .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is first ri@@ pe in the land , which they shall bring un@@ to the Lord , shall be th@@ ine ; every one that is clean in th@@ ine house shall eat of it .
and the f@@ les@@ h of them shall be th@@ ine , as the wave bre@@ ast and as the right sho@@ ul@@ der are th@@ ine .
and , be@@ hold , I have given the children of L@@ evi all the tenth in Israel for an inher@@ it@@ ance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
neither must the children of Israel hen@@ ce@@ forth come n@@ igh the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the L@@ evi@@ tes shall do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inher@@ it@@ ance .
and this your he@@ ave offering shall be rec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to you , as though it were the cor@@ n of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the ful@@ ness of the win@@ e@@ press .
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every he@@ ave offering of the Lord , of all the best there@@ of , even the hal@@ low@@ ed part there@@ of out of it .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , saying ,
and ye shall give her un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall s@@ lay her before his face :
and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est shall take of her blood with his fin@@ ger , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of her blood directly before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation seven times :
and one shall bur@@ n the he@@ if@@ er in his sight ; her s@@ kin , and her f@@ les@@ h , and her blood , with her D@@ ung , shall he bur@@ n :
and the pri@@ est shall take c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and scar@@ let , and cast it into the mid@@ st of the burning of the he@@ if@@ er .
then the pri@@ est shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and he shall ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp , and the pri@@ est shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that bur@@ net@@ h her shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es in water , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and shall be un@@ clean until the even .
this is the law , when a man di@@ eth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth one that is sla@@ in with a s@@ word in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and for an un@@ clean person they shall take of the ashes of the bur@@ n@@ t he@@ if@@ er of pur@@ ification for sin , and running water shall be put there@@ to in a ves@@ sel :
and it shall be a perpet@@ ual statute un@@ to them , that he that sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le@@ th the water of separation shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he that tou@@ ch@@ eth the water of separation shall be un@@ clean until even .
and there was no water for the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and they gathered themselves together against Mos@@ es and against Aaron .
and the people cho@@ de with Mos@@ es , and sp@@ ake , saying , Wo@@ uld God that we had died when our bre@@ th@@ ren died before the Lord !
and why have ye brought up the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord into this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that we and our c@@ attle should die there ?
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they fell upon their faces : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to them .
and Mos@@ es lifted up his hand , and with his ro@@ d he smo@@ te the rock twice : and the water came out ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation d@@ rank , and their be@@ asts also .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron , Bec@@ ause ye believed me not , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this Con@@ gre@@ gation into the land which I have given them .
and Mos@@ es sent mes@@ sen@@ gers from K@@ ade@@ sh un@@ to the king of E@@ dom , Th@@ us sa@@ ith TH@@ Y brother Israel , T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est all the trav@@ ail that hat@@ h be@@ fallen us :
how our fa@@ thers went down into Egypt , and we have d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans v@@ ex@@ ed us , and our fa@@ thers :
and the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , jour@@ ne@@ yed from K@@ ade@@ sh , and came un@@ to mount H@@ or .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron in mount H@@ or , by the coast of the land of E@@ dom , saying ,
Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given un@@ to the children of Israel , because ye rebel@@ led against my word at the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah .
take Aaron and Ele@@ azar his son , and bring them up un@@ to mount H@@ or :
and stri@@ p Aaron of his gar@@ ments , and put them upon Ele@@ azar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people , and shall die there .
and Mos@@ es did as the Lord comman@@ ded : and they went up into mount H@@ or in the sight of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and Mos@@ es stri@@ pped Aaron of his gar@@ ments , and put them upon Ele@@ azar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar came down from the mount .
and when all the Con@@ gre@@ gation saw that Aaron was dead , they mour@@ ned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
and when king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the sp@@ ies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and Israel vowed a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and said , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy their cities .
and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and they ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hor@@ ma@@ h .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from mount H@@ or by the way of the Red sea , to comp@@ ass the land of E@@ dom : and the sou@@ l of the people was much dis@@ cour@@ aged because of the way .
and the Lord sent fi@@ ery Ser@@ pen@@ ts among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died .
and the children of Israel set forward , and pit@@ ched in O@@ both .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from O@@ both , and pit@@ ched at I@@ je @@@ -@@ @ ab@@ ar@@ im , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness which is before Mo@@ a@@ b , toward the sun@@ rising .
from th@@ ence they removed , and pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of Zar@@ ed .
from th@@ ence they removed , and pit@@ ched on the other side of Ar@@ non , which is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that co@@ me@@ th out of the co@@ asts of the Am@@ ori@@ tes : for Ar@@ non is the border of Mo@@ a@@ b , between Mo@@ a@@ b and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord , What he did in the Red sea , and in the bro@@ oks of Ar@@ non ,
and at the stream of the bro@@ oks that go@@ eth down to the d@@ wel@@ ling of A@@ r , and li@@ eth upon the border of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and from th@@ ence they went to Be@@ er : that is the well where@@ of the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ ather the people together , and I will give them water .
the pr@@ inces dig@@ ged the well , the no@@ bles of the people dig@@ ged it , by the direction of the law@@ gi@@ ver , with their st@@ aves . and from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they went to Mat@@ tan@@ ah :
and from B@@ am@@ o@@ th in the val@@ ley , that is in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward J@@ es@@ him@@ on .
and S@@ ih@@ on would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but S@@ ih@@ on gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and he came to Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel took all these cities : and Israel d@@ wel@@ t in all the cities of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and in all the villages there@@ of .
for H@@ es@@ h@@ bon was the city of S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and taken all his land out of his hand , even un@@ to Ar@@ non .
for there is a fire gone out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , a fla@@ me from the city of S@@ ih@@ on : it hat@@ h consu@@ med A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the lor@@ ds of the high places of Ar@@ non .
Wo@@ e to the@@ e , Mo@@ a@@ b ! th@@ ou art und@@ one , O people of Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h : he hat@@ h given his sons that escaped , and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , into cap@@ tivity un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
we have shot at them ; H@@ es@@ h@@ bon is per@@ ished even un@@ to Di@@ bon , and we have laid them waste even un@@ to N@@ op@@ ha@@ h , which reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to M@@ ede@@ ba .
and they turned and went up by the way of B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
so they smo@@ te him , and his sons , and all his people , until there was none left him alive : and they poss@@ essed his land .
and the children of Israel set forward , and pit@@ ched in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b on this side Jordan by Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por saw all that Israel had done to the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
and Mo@@ a@@ b was sor@@ e afraid of the people , because they were many : and Mo@@ a@@ b was dist@@ ressed because of the children of Israel .
and the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said un@@ to God , Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por , king of Mo@@ a@@ b , hat@@ h sent un@@ to me , saying ,
be@@ hold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which cover@@ eth the face of the ear@@ th : come now , cur@@ se me them ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and the pr@@ inces of Mo@@ a@@ b rose up , and they went un@@ to Bal@@ ak , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am ref@@ us@@ eth to come with us .
and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por , Let nothing , I pra@@ y the@@ e , hin@@ der the@@ e from coming un@@ to me :
for I will promote the@@ e un@@ to very great honour , and I will do wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou say@@ est un@@ to me : come therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , cur@@ se me this people .
now therefore , I pra@@ y you , tar@@ ry ye also here this night , that I may know what the Lord will say un@@ to me more .
and Bal@@ a@@ am rose up in the morning , and s@@ add@@ led his ass , and went with the pr@@ inces of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went : and the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
but the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in a path of the v@@ ine@@ yards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she th@@ rust her@@ self un@@ to the wall , and cr@@ us@@ hed Bal@@ a@@ am 's fo@@ ot against the wall : and he smo@@ te her again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she fell down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led , and he smo@@ te the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and he bo@@ wed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , su@@ rely now also I had sla@@ in the@@ e , and sav@@ ed her alive .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , G@@ o with the men : but only the word that I shall speak un@@ to the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt speak . so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the pr@@ inces of Bal@@ ak .
and when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am was come , he went out to meet him un@@ to a city of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is in the border of Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most coast .
and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , did I not ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly send un@@ to the@@ e to call the@@ e ? where@@ fore ca@@ me@@ st th@@ ou not un@@ to me ? am I not able indeed to promote the@@ e to honour ?
and Bal@@ a@@ am said un@@ to Bal@@ ak , L@@ o , I am come un@@ to the@@ e : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God p@@ ut@@ te@@ th in my m@@ outh , that shall I speak .
and Bal@@ ak offered ox@@ en and she@@ ep , and sent to Bal@@ a@@ am , and to the pr@@ inces that were with him .
and Bal@@ ak did as Bal@@ a@@ am had spoken ; and Bal@@ ak and Bal@@ a@@ am offered on every alt@@ ar a bul@@ lock and a ram .
and he returned un@@ to him , and , lo , he stood by his bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , he , and all the pr@@ inces of Mo@@ a@@ b .
how shall I cur@@ se , whom God hat@@ h not Cur@@ sed ? or how shall I def@@ y , whom the Lord hat@@ h not de@@ fied ?
for from the top of the ro@@ cks I see him , and from the hil@@ ls I be@@ hold him : lo , the people shall d@@ well alone , and shall not be rec@@ kon@@ ed among the nations .
who can count the d@@ ust of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righ@@ te@@ ous , and let my last end be like his !
and he answ@@ ered and said , M@@ ust I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hat@@ h put in my m@@ outh ?
and he brought him into the field of Z@@ op@@ him , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and built seven al@@ tar@@ s , and offered a bul@@ lock and a ram on every alt@@ ar .
and when he came to him , be@@ hold , he stood by his bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the pr@@ inces of Mo@@ a@@ b with him . and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to him , What hat@@ h the Lord spoken ?
be@@ hold , I have received comman@@ d@@ ment to b@@ less : and he hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed ; and I can@@ not rever@@ se it .
he hat@@ h not be@@ held in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in Jac@@ o@@ b , neither hat@@ h he seen per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in Israel : the Lord his God is with him , and the sh@@ out of a king is among them .
God brought them out of Egypt ; he hat@@ h as it were the strength of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n .
su@@ rely there is no en@@ chan@@ tment against Jac@@ o@@ b , neither is there any div@@ ination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jac@@ o@@ b and of Israel , What hat@@ h God w@@ rought !
be@@ hold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the pre@@ y , and drink the blood of the sla@@ in .
but Bal@@ a@@ am answ@@ ered and said un@@ to Bal@@ ak , told not I the@@ e , saying , All that the Lord speak@@ eth , that I must do ?
and Bal@@ ak did as Bal@@ a@@ am had said , and offered a bul@@ lock and a ram on every alt@@ ar .
and when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased the Lord to b@@ less Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for en@@ chan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Bal@@ a@@ am lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abi@@ ding in his ten@@ ts according to their tri@@ bes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
and he took up his par@@ able , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hat@@ h said , and the man whose eyes are open hat@@ h said :
he hat@@ h said , which heard the words of God , which saw the vision of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , falling into a tr@@ ance , but having his eyes open :
as the val@@ ley@@ s are they spread forth , as gar@@ den@@ s by the river 's side , as the trees of lig@@ n alo@@ es which the Lord hat@@ h plan@@ ted , and as c@@ ed@@ ar trees bes@@ ide the waters .
he shall p@@ our the water out of his bu@@ c@@ kets , and his se@@ ed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than A@@ ga@@ g , and his k@@ ing@@ dom shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hat@@ h as it were the strength of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n : he shall eat up the nations his enem@@ ies , and shall break their b@@ ones , and Pi@@ erce them through with his ar@@ ro@@ ws .
and Bal@@ ak 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he smo@@ te his hands together : and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , I called the@@ e to cur@@ se mine enem@@ ies , and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast altogether b@@ les@@ sed them these three times .
therefore now flee th@@ ou to TH@@ Y place : I thought to promote the@@ e un@@ to great honour ; but , lo , the Lord hat@@ h kept the@@ e back from honour .
and now , be@@ hold , I go un@@ to my people : come therefore , and I will adverti@@ se the@@ e what this people shall do to TH@@ Y people in the latter days .
and he took up his par@@ able , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hat@@ h said , and the man whose eyes are open hat@@ h said :
he hat@@ h said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , falling into a tr@@ ance , but having his eyes open :
and E@@ dom shall be a possession , Se@@ ir also shall be a possession for his enem@@ ies ; and Israel shall do val@@ i@@ antly .
and when he looked on A@@ mal@@ ek , he took up his par@@ able , and said , A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he per@@ ish for ever .
and he looked on the Ken@@ ites , and took up his par@@ able , and said , Str@@ ong is TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ place , and th@@ ou p@@ ut@@ test TH@@ Y n@@ est in a rock .
and ships shall come from the coast of Ch@@ it@@ tim , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t As@@ sh@@ ur , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t E@@ ber , and he also shall per@@ ish for ever .
and Bal@@ a@@ am rose up , and went and returned to his place : and Bal@@ ak also went his way .
and Israel abo@@ de in Sh@@ it@@ tim , and the people began to commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and they called the people un@@ to the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of their go@@ ds : and the people did eat , and bo@@ wed down to their go@@ ds .
and Israel joined himself un@@ to Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ azar , the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , saw it , he rose up from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and took a j@@ av@@ elin in his hand ;
and those that died in the pla@@ gue were twenty and four thousand .
and he shall have it , and his se@@ ed after him , even the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of an ever@@ lasting pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; because he was z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for his God , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the children of Israel .

but among these there was not a man of them whom Mos@@ es and Aaron the pri@@ est num@@ ber@@ ed , when they num@@ ber@@ ed the children of Israel in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hat@@ h no son ? give un@@ to us therefore a possession among the bre@@ th@@ ren of our father .

and when th@@ ou h@@ ast seen it , th@@ ou also s@@ halt be gathered un@@ to TH@@ Y people , as Aaron TH@@ Y brother was gathered .
for ye rebel@@ led against my comman@@ d@@ ment in the de@@ sert of Z@@ in , in the stri@@ fe of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah in K@@ ade@@ sh in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord , saying ,

and th@@ ou s@@ halt put some of th@@ ine honour upon him , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel may be obe@@ di@@ ent .

and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es .
command the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , My offering , and my bread for my sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es made by fire , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to me , shall ye observe to offer un@@ to me in their due season .

it is a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , which was or@@ da@@ ined in mount S@@ ina@@ i for a swe@@ et sav@@ our , a sacrifice made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and the drink offering there@@ of shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lam@@ b : in the hol@@ y place s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the strong wine to be p@@ oured un@@ to the Lord for a drink offering .
and on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day two lam@@ bs of the first year without spot , and two tenth deals of fl@@ our for a meat offering , min@@ g@@ led with oil , and the drink offering there@@ of :
and in the begin@@ nings of your months ye shall offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord ; two young bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ram , seven lam@@ bs of the first year without spot ;

their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ lock , for the ram , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the heads of the tri@@ bes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded .
if a man vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , or swe@@ ar an oath to bin@@ d his sou@@ l with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proce@@ ede@@ th out of his m@@ outh .
if a woman also vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and bin@@ d her@@ self by a bond , being in her father 's house in her youth ;
and if she had at all an husband , when she vowed , or ut@@ tered ought out of her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and dis@@ allowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
these are the stat@@ utes , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the people , saying , ARM some of yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the war , and let them go against the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites , and av@@ en@@ ge the Lord of Mi@@ dian .
of every tri@@ be a thousand , throughout all the tri@@ bes of Israel , shall ye send to the war .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tri@@ be , twelve thousand armed for war .
and Mos@@ es sent them to the war , a thousand of every tri@@ be , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the hol@@ y instruments , and the tr@@ ump@@ ets to blow in his hand .
and they war@@ red against the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es ; and they sle@@ w all the mal@@ es .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the sp@@ oil of all their c@@ attle , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods .
and they bur@@ n@@ t all their cities where@@ in they d@@ wel@@ t , and all their good@@ ly c@@ ast@@ les , with fire .
and they took all the sp@@ oil , and all the pre@@ y , both of men and of be@@ asts .
and Mos@@ es , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and all the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with the officers of the host , with the cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
be@@ hold , these caused the children of Israel , through the coun@@ sel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ res@@ pass against the Lord in the matter of Pe@@ or , and there was a pla@@ gue among the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hat@@ h known man by lying with him .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h killed any person , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h touched any sla@@ in , pur@@ ify both yo@@ ur@@ selves and your cap@@ tives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est said un@@ to the men of war which went to the battle , This is the ordin@@ ance of the law which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es ;
and ye shall was@@ h your clo@@ th@@ es on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and after@@ ward ye shall come into the camp .
take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of be@@ ast , th@@ ou , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the chief fa@@ thers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
take it of their half , and give it un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , for an he@@ ave offering of the Lord .
and the bo@@ o@@ ty , being the rest of the pre@@ y which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and sev@@ enty thousand and five thousand she@@ ep ,
and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him .
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred she@@ ep :
and the Lord 's tri@@ bute of the she@@ ep was six hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen .
and the be@@ ev@@ es were thirty and six thousand ; of which the Lord 's tri@@ bute was thre@@ es@@ core and twelve .
and the ass@@ es were thirty thousand and five hundred ; of which the Lord 's tri@@ bute was thre@@ es@@ core and one .
and the persons were six@@ teen thousand ; of which the Lord 's tri@@ bute was thirty and two persons .
and Mos@@ es gave the tri@@ bute , which was the Lord 's he@@ ave offering , un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and of the children of Israel 's half , which Mos@@ es divided from the men that war@@ red ,
( now the half that per@@ tained un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred she@@ ep ,
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near un@@ to Mos@@ es :
and they said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ y servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there la@@ c@@ ket@@ h not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
( for the men of war had taken sp@@ oil , every man for himself . )
and Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , said they , if we have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , let this land be given un@@ to TH@@ Y servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the children of G@@ ad and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , shall your bre@@ th@@ ren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and where@@ fore dis@@ courage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hat@@ h given them ?
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led the same time , and he sw@@ are , saying ,
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , that had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , was consu@@ med .
and , be@@ hold , ye are risen up in your fa@@ thers ' stead , an increase of s@@ inf@@ ul men , to a@@ ug@@ ment yet the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord toward Israel .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them un@@ to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the f@@ enced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return un@@ to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inher@@ it@@ ance .
for we will not inher@@ it with them on yon@@ der side Jordan , or forward ; because our inher@@ it@@ ance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the Lord to war ,

and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying , Th@@ y servants will do as my lor@@ d comman@@ de@@ th .
our little ones , our wi@@ ves , our f@@ loc@@ ks , and all our c@@ attle , shall be there in the cities of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad :

so concerning them Mos@@ es comman@@ ded Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the chief fa@@ thers of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel :

we will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that the possession of our inher@@ it@@ ance on this side Jordan may be ours .

speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and quite p@@ lu@@ ck down all their high places :
and ye shall dis@@ poss@@ ess the inhabitants of the land , and d@@ well there@@ in : for I have given you the land to poss@@ ess it .
moreover it shall come to pass , that I shall do un@@ to you , as I thought to do un@@ to them .
then your south quarter shall be from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in along by the coast of E@@ dom , and your south border shall be the out@@ most coast of the salt sea eas@@ tw@@ ard :
and the border shall f@@ et@@ ch a comp@@ ass from Az@@ mon un@@ to the river of Egypt , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the sea .
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .

and the border shall go on to Z@@ ip@@ h@@ ron , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at Hazar @@@ -@@ @ en@@ an : this shall be your north border .

and the border shall go down to Jordan , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the co@@ asts there@@ of round about .
and Mos@@ es comman@@ ded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inher@@ it by lot , which the Lord comman@@ ded to give un@@ to the nine tri@@ bes , and to the half tri@@ be :
the two tri@@ bes and the half tri@@ be have received their inher@@ it@@ ance on this side Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o eas@@ tw@@ ard , toward the sun@@ rising .
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land un@@ to you : Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
and ye shall take one pr@@ ince of every tri@@ be , to divide the land by inher@@ it@@ ance .
and the names of the men are these : of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h .
and of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , Sh@@ em@@ uel the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud .

these are they whom the Lord comman@@ ded to divide the inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the children of Israel in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o , saying ,
command the children of Israel , that they give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes of the inher@@ it@@ ance of their possession cities to d@@ well in ; and ye shall give also un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes subur@@ bs for the cities round about them .
and the cities shall they have to d@@ well in ; and the subur@@ bs of them shall be for their c@@ attle , and for their goods , and for all their be@@ asts .
and the subur@@ bs of the cities , which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall reach from the wall of the city and ou@@ tw@@ ard a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes there shall be six cities for ref@@ uge , which ye shall appoint for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , that he may flee th@@ ither : and to them ye shall add for@@ ty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be for@@ ty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their subur@@ bs .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of ref@@ uge for you ; that the S@@ lay@@ er may flee th@@ ither , which kil@@ le@@ th any person at un@@ awar@@ es .
and they shall be un@@ to you cities for ref@@ uge from the av@@ eng@@ er ; that the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er die not , until he stand before the Con@@ gre@@ gation in judgment .
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for ref@@ uge .
Y@@ e shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which shall be cities of ref@@ uge .
and if he sm@@ ite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the mur@@ der@@ er shall su@@ rely be put to death .
and if he sm@@ ite him with thro@@ wing a stone , where@@ with he may die , and he die , he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the mur@@ der@@ er shall su@@ rely be put to death .
or if he sm@@ ite him with an hand weapon of wood , where@@ with he may die , and he die , he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the mur@@ der@@ er shall su@@ rely be put to death .
the reven@@ ger of blood himself shall s@@ lay the mur@@ der@@ er : when he me@@ ete@@ th him , he shall s@@ lay him .
or with any stone , where@@ with a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
but if the S@@ lay@@ er shall at any time come without the border of the city of his ref@@ uge , w@@ hi@@ ther he was fled ;
and the reven@@ ger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his ref@@ uge , and the reven@@ ger of blood kill the S@@ lay@@ er ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the S@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
W@@ hos@@ o kil@@ le@@ th any person , the mur@@ der@@ er shall be put to death by the m@@ outh of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a mur@@ der@@ er , which is guilty of death : but he shall be su@@ rely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his ref@@ uge , that he should come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it def@@ il@@ eth the land : and the land can@@ not be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed there@@ in , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The Lord comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for an inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by the Lord to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother un@@ to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and Mos@@ es comman@@ ded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord , saying , The tri@@ be of the sons of Joseph hat@@ h said well .
this is the thing which the Lord do@@ th command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them mar@@ ry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they mar@@ ry .
so shall not the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Israel remove from tri@@ be to tri@@ be : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of his fa@@ thers .
neither shall the inher@@ it@@ ance remove from one tri@@ be to another tri@@ be ; but every one of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inher@@ it@@ ance .
even as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so did the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had :
and they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , and their inher@@ it@@ ance remained in the tri@@ be of the family of their father .
these are the comman@@ d@@ ments and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es un@@ to the children of Israel in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
( there are eleven days ' journey from Ho@@ re@@ b by the way of mount Se@@ ir un@@ to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea . )
after he had sla@@ in S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an , which d@@ wel@@ t at A@@ star@@ o@@ th in E@@ dre@@ i :
on this side Jordan , in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , began Mos@@ es to declare this law , saying ,
and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
the Lord your God hat@@ h multi@@ p@@ lied you , and , be@@ hold , ye are this day as the stars of heav@@ en for multi@@ tude .
( the Lord God of your fa@@ thers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and b@@ less you , as he hat@@ h promised you ! )
take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tri@@ bes , and I will make them rul@@ ers over you .
and ye answ@@ ered me , and said , The thing which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken is good for us to do .
and I said un@@ to you , Y@@ e are come un@@ to the mountain of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which the Lord our God do@@ th give un@@ to us .
be@@ hold , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h set the land before the@@ e : go up and poss@@ ess it , as the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e ; fear not , neither be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
and they turned and went up into the mountain , and came un@@ to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and searched it out .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down un@@ to us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God do@@ th give us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to she@@ w you by what way ye should go , and in a cl@@ oud by day .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , and was wro@@ th , and sw@@ are , saying ,
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , which stan@@ de@@ th before the@@ e , he shall go in th@@ ither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inher@@ it it .
but as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way of the Red sea .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , S@@ ay un@@ to them , G@@ o not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye be s@@ mit@@ ten before your enem@@ ies .
so I sp@@ ake un@@ to you ; and ye would not hear , but rebel@@ led against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and went pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously up into the hill .
and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t in that mountain , came out against you , and ch@@ ased you , as be@@ es do , and destroyed you in Se@@ ir , even un@@ to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
so ye abo@@ de in K@@ ade@@ sh many days , according un@@ to the days that ye abo@@ de there .
then we turned , and took our journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way of the Red sea , as the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to me : and we comp@@ ass@@ ed mount Se@@ ir many days .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to me , saying ,
and command th@@ ou the people , saying , Y@@ e are to pass through the coast of your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore :
med@@ dle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a fo@@ ot b@@ read@@ th ; because I have given mount Se@@ ir un@@ to E@@ sa@@ u for a possession .
Y@@ e shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
the Em@@ ims d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in in times past , a people great , and many , and t@@ all , as the An@@ ak@@ ims ;
for indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consu@@ med .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consu@@ med and dead from among the people ,
T@@ ho@@ u art to pass over through A@@ r , the coast of Mo@@ a@@ b , this day :
( that also was accounted a land of gi@@ ants : gi@@ ants d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in in old time ; and the Am@@ mon@@ ites call them Z@@ am@@ z@@ um@@ m@@ ims ;
a people great , and many , and t@@ all , as the An@@ ak@@ ims ; but the Lord destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead :
as he did to the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir , when he destroyed the Hor@@ ims from before them ; and they succeeded them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead even un@@ to this day :
and the Av@@ ims which d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ er@@ im , even un@@ to Az@@ z@@ ah , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ ims , which came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead . )
let me pass through TH@@ Y land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn un@@ to the right hand nor to the left .
then S@@ ih@@ on came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Ja@@ haz .
and the Lord our God delivered him before us ; and we smo@@ te him , and his sons , and all his people .
only the c@@ attle we took for a pre@@ y un@@ to ourselves , and the sp@@ oil of the cities which we took .
only un@@ to the land of the children of Am@@ mon th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st not , nor un@@ to any place of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , nor un@@ to the cities in the mountains , nor un@@ to wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God for@@ bad us .
then we turned , and went up the way to B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
so the Lord our God delivered into our hands O@@ g also , the king of B@@ ash@@ an , and all his people : and we smo@@ te him until none was left to him remaining .
and we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , thre@@ es@@ core cities , all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g in B@@ ash@@ an .
and we ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , as we did un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , ut@@ ter@@ ly destroying the men , women , and children , of every city .
but all the c@@ attle , and the sp@@ oil of the cities , we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon ;
( which Her@@ mon the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians call S@@ iri@@ on ; and the Am@@ ori@@ tes call it S@@ hen@@ ir ; )
and this land , which we poss@@ essed at that time , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , and half mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and the cities there@@ of , gave I un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes .
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , being the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , with all B@@ ash@@ an , which was called the land of gi@@ ants .
J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h took all the country of Ar@@ go@@ b un@@ to the co@@ asts of G@@ es@@ hur@@ i and Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ i ; and called them after his own name , B@@ ash@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ vo@@ th @@@ -@@ @ j@@ air , un@@ to this day .
and un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and un@@ to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even un@@ to the river Ar@@ non half the val@@ ley , and the border even un@@ to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
the pla@@ in also , and Jordan , and the coast there@@ of , from Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth even un@@ to the sea of the pla@@ in , even the salt sea , under Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ ga@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and I comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua at that time , saying , Th@@ ine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hat@@ h done un@@ to these two kings : so shall the Lord do un@@ to all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est .
Y@@ e shall not fear them : for the Lord your God he shall fight for you .
O Lord God , th@@ ou h@@ ast begun to she@@ w TH@@ Y ser@@ vant TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand : for what God is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to TH@@ Y works , and according to TH@@ Y might ?
but the Lord was wro@@ th with me for your sak@@ es , and would not hear me : and the Lord said un@@ to me , Let it su@@ ffic@@ e the@@ e ; speak no more un@@ to me of this matter .
but charge Jos@@ hua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inher@@ it the land which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
Y@@ e shall not add un@@ to the word which I command you , neither shall ye dimin@@ ish ought from it , that ye may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : for all the men that followed Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h destroyed them from among you .
but ye that did cle@@ ave un@@ to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
be@@ hold , I have ta@@ ught you stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , even as the Lord my God comman@@ ded me , that ye should do so in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it .
for what nation is there so great , who hat@@ h God so n@@ igh un@@ to them , as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
and what nation is there so great , that hat@@ h stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments so righ@@ te@@ ous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
and ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire un@@ to the mid@@ st of heav@@ en , with d@@ ark@@ ness , cl@@ ou@@ ds , and th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you out of the mid@@ st of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no si@@ milit@@ u@@ de ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared un@@ to you his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which he comman@@ ded you to perform , even ten comman@@ d@@ ments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
and the Lord comman@@ ded me at that time to te@@ ach you stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , that ye might do them in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over to poss@@ ess it .
take ye therefore good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for ye saw no manner of si@@ milit@@ u@@ de on the day that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in Ho@@ re@@ b out of the mid@@ st of the fire :
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and sw@@ are that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in un@@ to that good land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and poss@@ ess that good land .
and the Lord shall sc@@ at@@ ter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord shall lead you .
and there ye shall serve go@@ ds , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor s@@ me@@ ll .
but if from th@@ ence th@@ ou s@@ halt seek the Lord TH@@ Y God , th@@ ou s@@ halt find him , if th@@ ou seek him with all TH@@ Y heart and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
when th@@ ou art in tri@@ bu@@ lation , and all these things are come upon the@@ e , even in the latter days , if th@@ ou turn to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his voice ;
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a mer@@ ci@@ ful God ; ) he will not for@@ sake the@@ e , neither destroy the@@ e , nor forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers which he sw@@ are un@@ to them .
did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the mid@@ st of the fire , as th@@ ou h@@ ast heard , and live ?
un@@ to the@@ e it was she@@ wed , that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test know that the Lord he is God ; there is none else bes@@ ide him .
and because he lov@@ ed TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought the@@ e out in his sight with his m@@ igh@@ ty power out of Egypt ;
to drive out nations from before the@@ e greater and m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than th@@ ou art , to bring the@@ e in , to give the@@ e their land for an inher@@ it@@ ance , as it is this day .
know therefore this day , and consider it in th@@ ine heart , that the Lord he is God in heav@@ en above , and upon the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath : there is none else .
that the S@@ lay@@ er might flee th@@ ither , which should kill his neighbour un@@ awar@@ es , and ha@@ ted him not in times past ; and that fle@@ eing un@@ to one of these cities he might live :
name@@ ly , B@@ ez@@ er in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in the pla@@ in country , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites ; and Ram@@ o@@ th in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , of the G@@ adi@@ tes ; and G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an , of the Man@@ as@@ sites .
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
and they poss@@ essed his land , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which were on this side Jordan toward the sun@@ rising ;
and Mos@@ es called all Israel , and said un@@ to them , He@@ ar , O Israel , the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which I speak in your e@@ ars this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the Lord made not this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with our fa@@ thers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to she@@ w you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
I am the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the waters ben@@ e@@ ath the ear@@ th :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not take the name of the Lord TH@@ Y God in v@@ ain : for the Lord will not hold him guil@@ t@@ less that tak@@ eth his name in v@@ ain .
honour TH@@ Y father and TH@@ Y mother , as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e ; that TH@@ Y days may be prol@@ on@@ ged , and that it may go well with the@@ e , in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consum@@ e us : if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
go th@@ ou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak th@@ ou un@@ to us all that the Lord our God shall speak un@@ to the@@ e ; and we will hear it , and do it .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
Y@@ e shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
now these are the comman@@ d@@ ments , the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord your God comman@@ ded to te@@ ach you , that ye might do them in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y might .
and these words , which I command the@@ e this day , shall be in th@@ ine heart :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d them for a sign upon th@@ ine hand , and they shall be as fron@@ t@@ lets between th@@ ine eyes .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt write them upon the posts of TH@@ Y house , and on TH@@ Y gates .
then be@@ w@@ are lest th@@ ou forget the Lord , which brought the@@ e forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
Y@@ e shall not go after other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the people which are round about you ;
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a Je@@ al@@ ous God among you ) lest the an@@ ger of the Lord TH@@ Y God be kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and destroy the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall not temp@@ t the Lord your God , as ye temp@@ ted him in Mas@@ sa@@ h .
Y@@ e shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , and his testimon@@ ies , and his stat@@ utes , which he hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est go in and poss@@ ess the good land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ,
and when TH@@ Y son ask@@ eth the@@ e in time to come , saying , What mean the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord our God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you ?
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to TH@@ Y son , We were P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's bon@@ d@@ men in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand :
and the Lord she@@ wed signs and won@@ ders , great and sor@@ e , upon Egypt , upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from th@@ ence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sw@@ are un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
and the Lord comman@@ ded us to do all these stat@@ utes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
and it shall be our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , if we observe to do all these comman@@ d@@ ments before the Lord our God , as he hat@@ h comman@@ ded us .
and when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver them before the@@ e ; th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite them , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them ; th@@ ou s@@ halt make no C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , nor she@@ w mer@@ cy un@@ to them :
neither s@@ halt th@@ ou make marri@@ ages with them ; TH@@ Y daughter th@@ ou s@@ halt not give un@@ to his son , nor his daughter s@@ halt th@@ ou take un@@ to TH@@ Y son .
for they will turn away TH@@ Y son from following me , that they may serve other go@@ ds : so will the an@@ ger of the Lord be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and destroy the@@ e su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their al@@ tar@@ s , and break down their images , and cut down their gro@@ ves , and bur@@ n their Gra@@ ven images with fire .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a special people un@@ to himself , above all people that are upon the face of the ear@@ th .
the Lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fe@@ west of all people :
know therefore that the Lord TH@@ Y God , he is God , the fa@@ ith@@ ful God , which keep@@ eth C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and mer@@ cy with them that love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments to a thousand generations ;
and re@@ pay@@ eth them that h@@ ate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be S@@ lack to him that ha@@ te@@ th him , he will repay him to his face .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore keep the comman@@ d@@ ments , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which I command the@@ e this day , to do them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be b@@ les@@ sed above all people : there shall not be male or female bar@@ ren among you , or among your c@@ attle .
and the Lord will take away from the@@ e all si@@ ck@@ ness , and will put none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou know@@ est , upon the@@ e ; but will lay them upon all them that h@@ ate the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt consum@@ e all the people which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver the@@ e ; th@@ ine eye shall have no p@@ ity upon them : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are un@@ to the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not be afraid of them : but s@@ halt well remember what the Lord TH@@ Y God did un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all Egypt ;
moreover the Lord TH@@ Y God will send the hor@@ net among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from the@@ e , be destroyed .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not be aff@@ righ@@ ted at them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is among you , a m@@ igh@@ ty God and ter@@ ri@@ ble .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will put out those nations before the@@ e by little and little : th@@ ou may@@ est not consum@@ e them at once , lest the be@@ asts of the field increase upon the@@ e .
but the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver them un@@ to the@@ e , and shall destroy them with a m@@ igh@@ ty destruction , until they be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt destroy their name from under heav@@ en : there shall no man be able to stand before the@@ e , until th@@ ou have destroyed them .
all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multi@@ ply , and go in and poss@@ ess the land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent wa@@ xed not old upon the@@ e , neither did TH@@ Y fo@@ ot s@@ well , these for@@ ty years .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also consider in th@@ ine heart , that , as a man ch@@ as@@ ten@@ eth his son , so the Lord TH@@ Y God ch@@ as@@ ten@@ eth the@@ e .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
for the Lord TH@@ Y God br@@ ing@@ eth the@@ e into a good land , a land of bro@@ oks of water , of fo@@ un@@ tains and dep@@ ths that spring out of val@@ ley@@ s and hil@@ ls ;
a land of wheat , and bar@@ ley , and v@@ ines , and fi@@ g trees , and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates ; a land of oil olive , and hon@@ ey ;
a land where@@ in th@@ ou s@@ halt eat bread without scar@@ cen@@ ess , th@@ ou s@@ halt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hil@@ ls th@@ ou may@@ est di@@ g br@@ ass .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast e@@ aten and art full , then th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ less the Lord TH@@ Y God for the good land which he hat@@ h given the@@ e .
be@@ w@@ are that th@@ ou forget not the Lord TH@@ Y God , in not keeping his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his judg@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , which I command the@@ e this day :
L@@ est when th@@ ou h@@ ast e@@ aten and art full , and h@@ ast built good@@ ly houses , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in ;
and when TH@@ Y her@@ ds and TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks multi@@ ply , and TH@@ Y silver and TH@@ Y gold is multi@@ p@@ lied , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast is multi@@ p@@ lied ;
who led the@@ e through that great and ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where@@ in were fi@@ ery Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought the@@ e forth water out of the rock of F@@ lin@@ t ;
who f@@ ed the@@ e in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with man@@ na , which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers knew not , that he might hum@@ ble the@@ e , and that he might prove the@@ e , to do the@@ e good at TH@@ Y latter end ;
and th@@ ou say in th@@ ine heart , My power and the might of mine hand hat@@ h gotten me this wealth .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember the Lord TH@@ Y God : for it is he that gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e power to get wealth , that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , as it is this day .
as the nations which the Lord destro@@ yet@@ h before your face , so shall ye per@@ ish ; because ye would not be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to the voice of the Lord your God .
a people great and t@@ all , the children of the An@@ ak@@ ims , whom th@@ ou know@@ est , and of whom th@@ ou h@@ ast heard say , Wh@@ o can stand before the children of An@@ ak !
also in Ho@@ re@@ b ye provoked the Lord to wr@@ ath , so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
furthermore the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to me , saying , I have seen this people , and , be@@ hold , it is a sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked people :
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blo@@ t out their name from under heav@@ en : and I will make of the@@ e a nation m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er and greater than they .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant were in my two hands .
and I took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and br@@ ake them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the an@@ ger and hot disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , where@@ with the Lord was wro@@ th against you to destroy you . but the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me at that time also .
and the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him : and I pray@@ ed for Aaron also the same time .
thus I fell down before the Lord for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , as I fell down at the first ; because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
remember TH@@ Y servants , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b ; look not un@@ to the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of this people , nor to their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor to their sin :
and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est , and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them in the Ar@@ k .
and I made an Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and he@@ wed two tables of stone like un@@ to the first , and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
and I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the Ar@@ k which I had made ; and there they be , as the Lord comman@@ ded me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his stead .
from th@@ ence they jour@@ ne@@ yed un@@ to Gu@@ d@@ go@@ da@@ h ; and from Gu@@ d@@ go@@ da@@ h to J@@ ot@@ b@@ ath , a land of rivers of waters .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , take TH@@ Y journey before the people , that they may go in and poss@@ ess the land , which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers to give un@@ to them .
to keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and his stat@@ utes , which I command the@@ e this day for TH@@ Y good ?
be@@ hold , the heav@@ en and the heav@@ en of heav@@ ens is the Lord 's TH@@ Y God , the ear@@ th also , with all that there@@ in is .
only the Lord had a de@@ light in TH@@ Y fa@@ thers to love them , and he chose their se@@ ed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
for the Lord your God is God of go@@ ds , and Lord of lor@@ ds , a great God , a m@@ igh@@ ty , and a ter@@ ri@@ ble , which regar@@ de@@ th not persons , nor tak@@ eth reward :
he do@@ th exec@@ ute the judgment of the fa@@ ther@@ less and wi@@ dow , and lov@@ eth the st@@ ran@@ ger , in giving him food and ra@@ im@@ ent .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fear the Lord TH@@ Y God ; him s@@ halt th@@ ou serve , and to him s@@ halt th@@ ou cle@@ ave , and swe@@ ar by his name .
he is TH@@ Y praise , and he is TH@@ Y God , that hat@@ h done for the@@ e these great and ter@@ ri@@ ble things , which th@@ ine eyes have seen .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God , and keep his charge , and his stat@@ utes , and his judg@@ ments , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , al@@ way .
and his mir@@ ac@@ les , and his acts , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and un@@ to all his land ;
and what he did un@@ to you in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , until ye came into this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did .
therefore shall ye keep all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and poss@@ ess the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it ;
and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers to give un@@ to them and to their se@@ ed , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
but the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it , is a land of hil@@ ls and val@@ ley@@ s , and drin@@ ket@@ h water of the rain of heav@@ en :
a land which the Lord TH@@ Y God c@@ aret@@ h for : the eyes of the Lord TH@@ Y God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even un@@ to the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that th@@ ou may@@ est gather in TH@@ Y cor@@ n , and TH@@ Y wine , and th@@ ine oil .
and I will send gr@@ ass in TH@@ Y fields for TH@@ Y c@@ attle , that th@@ ou may@@ est eat and be full .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that your heart be not dec@@ e@@ ived , and ye turn aside , and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l , and bin@@ d them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as fron@@ t@@ lets between your eyes .
and ye shall te@@ ach them your children , speaking of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt write them upon the door posts of th@@ ine house , and upon TH@@ Y gates :
then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall poss@@ ess greater nations and m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than yo@@ ur@@ selves .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall tre@@ ad upon , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to you .
a b@@ les@@ sing , if ye obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
and a cur@@ se , if ye will not obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h brought the@@ e in un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it , that th@@ ou s@@ halt put the b@@ les@@ sing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se upon mount E@@ bal .
for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess the land which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you , and ye shall poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in .
and ye shall observe to do all the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which I set before you this day .
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , all the days that ye live upon the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , upon the high mountains , and upon the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that ye put your hand un@@ to , ye and your households , where@@ in the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e .
Y@@ e shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is right in his own eyes .
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inher@@ it@@ ance , which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self that th@@ ou offer not TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings in every place that th@@ ou se@@ est :
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of TH@@ Y tri@@ bes , there th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there th@@ ou s@@ halt do all that I command the@@ e .
only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall p@@ our it upon the ear@@ th as water .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self that th@@ ou for@@ sake not the Lev@@ ite as long as th@@ ou li@@ v@@ est upon the ear@@ th .
even as the ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck and the har@@ t is e@@ aten , so th@@ ou s@@ halt eat them : the un@@ clean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
only be sure that th@@ ou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and th@@ ou may@@ est not eat the life with the f@@ les@@ h .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not eat it ; th@@ ou s@@ halt p@@ our it upon the ear@@ th as water .
only TH@@ Y hol@@ y things which th@@ ou h@@ ast , and TH@@ Y vows , th@@ ou s@@ halt take , and go un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose :
when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall cut off the nations from before the@@ e , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess them , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their land ;
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , where@@ of he sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Let us go after other go@@ ds , which th@@ ou h@@ ast not known , and let us serve them ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
Y@@ e shall walk after the Lord your God , and fear him , and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and obe@@ y his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cle@@ ave un@@ to him .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not consent un@@ to him , nor he@@ arken un@@ to him ; neither shall th@@ ine eye p@@ ity him , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou spar@@ e , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou conce@@ al him :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely kill him ; th@@ ine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hat@@ h sought to th@@ rust the@@ e away from the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess as this is among you .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought among you ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely sm@@ ite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in , and the c@@ attle there@@ of , with the edge of the s@@ word .
Y@@ e are the children of the Lord your God : ye shall not cut yo@@ ur@@ selves , nor make any bal@@ d@@ ness between your eyes for the dead .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and the Lord hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people un@@ to himself , above all the nations that are upon the ear@@ th .
these are the be@@ asts which ye shall eat : the o@@ x , the she@@ ep , and the go@@ at ,
the har@@ t , and the ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck , and the f@@ allow de@@ er , and the wild go@@ at , and the p@@ y@@ gar@@ g , and the wild o@@ x , and the ch@@ am@@ o@@ is .
and every be@@ ast that par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and cle@@ av@@ eth the cle@@ ft into two cla@@ ws , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d among the be@@ asts , that ye shall eat .
and the sw@@ ine , because it divi@@ de@@ th the ho@@ of , yet che@@ w@@ eth not the cu@@ d , it is un@@ clean un@@ to you : ye shall not eat of their f@@ les@@ h , nor touch their dead car@@ case .
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fin@@ s and scal@@ es shall ye eat :
but these are they of which ye shall not eat : the e@@ ag@@ le , and os@@ si@@ fra@@ ge , and the os@@ pra@@ y ,
and the g@@ le@@ de , and the k@@ ite , and the vul@@ ture after his kind ,
and the ow@@ l , and the night ha@@ w@@ k , and the c@@ uc@@ ko@@ w , and the ha@@ w@@ k after his kind ,
and the stor@@ k , and the her@@ on after her kind , and the lap@@ wing , and the B@@ AT .
and every cre@@ eping thing that f@@ li@@ eth is un@@ clean un@@ to you : they shall not be e@@ aten .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt truly ti@@ the all the increase of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , that the field br@@ ing@@ eth forth year by year .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in th@@ ine hand , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose :
and the Lev@@ ite that is within TH@@ Y gates ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not for@@ sake him ; for he hat@@ h no part nor inher@@ it@@ ance with the@@ e .
at the end of three years th@@ ou s@@ halt bring forth all the ti@@ the of th@@ ine increase the same year , and s@@ halt lay it up within TH@@ Y gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every credi@@ tor that len@@ de@@ th ought un@@ to his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the Lord 's release .
of a foreig@@ ner th@@ ou may@@ est exact it again : but that which is th@@ ine with TH@@ Y brother th@@ ine hand shall release ;
but th@@ ou s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to him , and s@@ halt su@@ rely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wan@@ te@@ th .
for the poor shall never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to TH@@ Y brother , to TH@@ Y poor , and to TH@@ Y ne@@ edy , in TH@@ Y land .
and if TH@@ Y brother , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w man , or an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w woman , be sold un@@ to the@@ e , and serve the@@ e six years ; then in the seventh year th@@ ou s@@ halt let him go free from the@@ e .
and when th@@ ou sen@@ dest him out free from the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not let him go away empty :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of TH@@ Y flock , and out of TH@@ Y floor , and out of TH@@ Y win@@ e@@ press : of that where@@ with the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to him .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in the land of Egypt , and the Lord TH@@ Y God re@@ deemed the@@ e : therefore I command the@@ e this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say un@@ to the@@ e , I will not go away from the@@ e ; because he lov@@ eth the@@ e and th@@ ine house , because he is well with the@@ e ;
then th@@ ou s@@ halt take an a@@ ul , and th@@ rust it through his e@@ ar un@@ to the door , and he shall be TH@@ Y ser@@ vant for ever . and also un@@ to TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant th@@ ou s@@ halt do likewise .
all the fir@@ st@@ ling mal@@ es that come of TH@@ Y her@@ d and of TH@@ Y flock th@@ ou s@@ halt sanc@@ ti@@ fy un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : th@@ ou s@@ halt do no work with the fir@@ st@@ ling of TH@@ Y bul@@ lock , nor s@@ hear the fir@@ st@@ ling of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat it before the Lord TH@@ Y God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y household .
and if there be any ble@@ mis@@ h there@@ in , as if it be la@@ me , or b@@ lin@@ d , or have any ill ble@@ mis@@ h , th@@ ou s@@ halt not sacrifice it un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
only th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat the blood there@@ of ; th@@ ou s@@ halt p@@ our it upon the ground as water .
observe the month of A@@ bi@@ b , and keep the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : for in the month of A@@ bi@@ b the Lord TH@@ Y God brought the@@ e forth out of Egypt by night .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore sacrifice the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
T@@ ho@@ u may@@ est not sacrifice the pass@@ over within any of TH@@ Y gates , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : and th@@ ou s@@ halt turn in the morning , and go un@@ to TH@@ Y ten@@ ts .
six days th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a so@@ lem@@ n assembly to the Lord TH@@ Y God : th@@ ou s@@ halt do no work there@@ in .
seven weeks s@@ halt th@@ ou number un@@ to the@@ e : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as th@@ ou begin@@ n@@ est to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the cor@@ n .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in Egypt : and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe and do these stat@@ utes .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt observe the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les seven days , after that th@@ ou h@@ ast gathered in TH@@ Y cor@@ n and TH@@ Y wine :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the b@@ les@@ sing of the Lord TH@@ Y God which he hat@@ h given the@@ e .
judges and officers s@@ halt th@@ ou make the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , throughout TH@@ Y tri@@ bes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not w@@ rest judgment ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift do@@ th b@@ lin@@ d the eyes of the wise , and per@@ ver@@ t the words of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
that which is altogether just s@@ halt th@@ ou follow , that th@@ ou may@@ est live , and inher@@ it the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not plant the@@ e a gro@@ ve of any trees near un@@ to the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt make the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not sacrifice un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God any bul@@ lock , or she@@ ep , where@@ in is ble@@ mis@@ h , or any ev@@ il@@ fav@@ ou@@ red@@ ness : for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
if there be found among you , within any of TH@@ Y gates which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , man or woman , that hat@@ h w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord TH@@ Y God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and hat@@ h gone and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heav@@ en , which I have not comman@@ ded ;
and it be told the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of it , and inqu@@ ired dil@@ ig@@ ently , and , be@@ hold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought in Israel :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come un@@ to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and un@@ to the judge that shall be in those days , and inqu@@ ire ; and they shall she@@ w the@@ e the sentence of judgment :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall she@@ w the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe to do according to all that they inform the@@ e :
neither shall he multi@@ ply wi@@ ves to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multi@@ ply to himself silver and gold .
the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the tri@@ be of L@@ evi , shall have no part nor inher@@ it@@ ance with Israel : they shall eat the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and his inher@@ it@@ ance .
therefore shall they have no inher@@ it@@ ance among their bre@@ th@@ ren : the Lord is their inher@@ it@@ ance , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to them .
the fir@@ st@@ fruit also of TH@@ Y cor@@ n , of TH@@ Y wine , and of th@@ ine oil , and the first of the F@@ le@@ ece of TH@@ Y she@@ ep , s@@ halt th@@ ou give him .
for the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen him out of all TH@@ Y tri@@ bes , to stand to minister in the name of the Lord , him and his sons for ever .
and if a Lev@@ ite come from any of TH@@ Y gates out of all Israel , where he so@@ jour@@ ned , and come with all the desire of his mind un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God , as all his bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes do , which stand there before the Lord .
when th@@ ou art come into the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not learn to do after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of those nations .
for all that do these things are an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord : and because of these ab@@ omin@@ ations the Lord TH@@ Y God do@@ th drive them out from before the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be perfect with the Lord TH@@ Y God .
for these nations , which th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess , hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to observers of times , and un@@ to di@@ vin@@ ers : but as for the@@ e , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h not suffered the@@ e so to do .
the Lord TH@@ Y God will raise up un@@ to the@@ e a Pro@@ phe@@ t from the mid@@ st of the@@ e , of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; un@@ to him ye shall he@@ arken ;
and the Lord said un@@ to me , They have well spoken that which they have spoken .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not he@@ arken un@@ to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
and if th@@ ou say in th@@ ine heart , Ho@@ w shall we know the word which the Lord hat@@ h not spoken ?
when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h cut off the nations , whose land the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their cities , and in their houses ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt separate three cities for the@@ e in the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it .
and this is the case of the S@@ lay@@ er , which shall flee th@@ ither , that he may live : W@@ hos@@ o kil@@ le@@ th his neighbour ignor@@ antly , whom he ha@@ ted not in time past ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt separate three cities for the@@ e .
that innocent blood be not shed in TH@@ Y land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance , and so blood be upon the@@ e .
but if any man h@@ ate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and sm@@ ite him mort@@ ally that he die , and fle@@ eth into one of these cities :
then the el@@ ders of his city shall send and f@@ et@@ ch him th@@ ence , and deliver him into the hand of the av@@ eng@@ er of blood , that he may die .
Th@@ ine eye shall not p@@ ity him , but th@@ ou s@@ halt put away the guil@@ t of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with the@@ e .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the Lord , before the pri@@ ests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make dil@@ ig@@ ent In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition : and , be@@ hold , if the witness be a false witness , and hat@@ h testified fal@@ sely against his brother ;
then shall ye do un@@ to him , as he had thought to have done un@@ to his brother : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put the ev@@ il away from among you .
and th@@ ine eye shall not p@@ ity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , to@@ o@@ th for to@@ o@@ th , hand for hand , fo@@ ot for fo@@ ot .
and it shall be , when ye are come n@@ igh un@@ to the battle , that the pri@@ est shall approach and speak un@@ to the people ,
for the Lord your God is he that go@@ eth with you , to fight for you ag@@ gin@@ st your enem@@ ies , to save you .
and what man is there that hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed a wife , and hat@@ h not taken her ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking un@@ to the people , that they shall make cap@@ tains of the armies to lead the people .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st n@@ igh un@@ to a city to fight against it , then procla@@ im peace un@@ to it .
and it shall be , if it make the@@ e answer of peace , and open un@@ to the@@ e , then it shall be , that all the people that is found there@@ in shall be tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to the@@ e , and they shall serve the@@ e .
and if it will make no peace with the@@ e , but will make war against the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt bes@@ i@@ ege it :
and when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h delivered it into th@@ ine hands , th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite every male there@@ of with the edge of the s@@ word :
thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to all the cities which are very far off from the@@ e , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these people , which the Lord TH@@ Y God do@@ th give the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance , th@@ ou s@@ halt save alive nothing that bre@@ ath@@ eth :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them ; name@@ ly , the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e :
that they te@@ ach you not to do after all their ab@@ omin@@ ations , which they have done un@@ to their go@@ ds ; so should ye sin against the Lord your God .
if one be found sla@@ in in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hat@@ h sla@@ in him :
then TH@@ Y el@@ ders and TH@@ Y judges shall come forth , and they shall measure un@@ to the cities which are round about him that is sla@@ in :
and it shall be , that the city which is next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take an he@@ if@@ er , which hat@@ h not been w@@ rought with , and which hat@@ h not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
and the el@@ ders of that city shall bring down the he@@ if@@ er un@@ to a roug@@ h val@@ ley , which is neither ear@@ ed nor so@@ wn , and shall strike off the he@@ if@@ er 's nec@@ k there in the val@@ ley :
and all the el@@ ders of that city , that are next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , shall was@@ h their hands over the he@@ if@@ er that is be@@ headed in the val@@ ley :
be mer@@ ci@@ ful , O Lord , un@@ to TH@@ Y people Israel , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed , and lay not innocent blood un@@ to TH@@ Y people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be for@@ given them .
so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away the guil@@ t of innocent blood from among you , when th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
when th@@ ou go@@ est forth to war against th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h delivered them into th@@ ine hands , and th@@ ou h@@ ast taken them cap@@ tive ,
and se@@ est among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and h@@ ast a desire un@@ to her , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest have her to TH@@ Y wife ;
then th@@ ou s@@ halt bring her home to th@@ ine house ; and she shall s@@ have her head , and par@@ e her n@@ ails ;
then it shall be , when he mak@@ eth his sons to inher@@ it that which he hat@@ h , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , which is indeed the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , which will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have ch@@ as@@ tened him , will not he@@ arken un@@ to them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , and un@@ to the gate of his place ;
and they shall say un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , This our son is st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous , he will not obe@@ y our voice ; he is a gl@@ ut@@ ton , and a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d .
and if a man have committed a sin wor@@ thy of death , and he be to be put to death , and th@@ ou han@@ g him on a tree :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see the brother 's o@@ x or his she@@ ep go as@@ tra@@ y , and hide th@@ y@@ self from them : th@@ ou s@@ halt in any case bring them again un@@ to TH@@ Y brother .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see TH@@ Y brother 's ass or his o@@ x fall down by the way , and hide th@@ y@@ self from them : th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely help him to lift them up again .
the woman shall not wear that which per@@ tain@@ eth un@@ to a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's gar@@ ment : for all that do so are ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to the@@ e ; that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est prol@@ ong TH@@ Y days .
when th@@ ou buil@@ dest a new house , then th@@ ou s@@ halt make a batt@@ lement for TH@@ Y ro@@ of , that th@@ ou bring not blood upon th@@ ine house , if any man fall from th@@ ence .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not so@@ w TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard with di@@ vers se@@ eds : lest the fruit of TH@@ Y se@@ ed which th@@ ou h@@ ast so@@ wn , and the fruit of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , be def@@ iled .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not wear a gar@@ ment of di@@ vers sor@@ ts , as of wo@@ ol@@ len and lin@@ en together .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt make the@@ e fr@@ inges upon the four quarters of TH@@ Y ves@@ ture , where@@ with th@@ ou cover@@ est th@@ y@@ self .
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an ev@@ il name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a ma@@ id :
then shall the father of the dam@@ sel , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the dam@@ sel 's vir@@ gin@@ ity un@@ to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate :
and the el@@ ders of that city shall take that man and ch@@ as@@ tise him ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away ev@@ il from Israel .
if a dam@@ sel that is a vir@@ gin be bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed un@@ to an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if a man find a bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed dam@@ sel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die :
but un@@ to the dam@@ sel th@@ ou s@@ halt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
for he found her in the field , and the bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed dam@@ sel cri@@ ed , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a dam@@ sel that is a vir@@ gin , which is not bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
he that is wounded in the stones , or hat@@ h his priv@@ y member cut off , shall not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord .
a Bas@@ tar@@ d shall not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord .
an Am@@ mon@@ ite or Mo@@ abi@@ te shall not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord for ever :
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against the@@ e Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or of P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se the@@ e .
nevertheless the Lord TH@@ Y God would not he@@ arken un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am ; but the Lord TH@@ Y God turned the cur@@ se into a b@@ les@@ sing un@@ to the@@ e , because the Lord TH@@ Y God lov@@ ed the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not ab@@ h@@ or an E@@ dom@@ ite ; for he is TH@@ Y brother : th@@ ou s@@ halt not ab@@ h@@ or an Egyptian ; because th@@ ou w@@ ast a st@@ ran@@ ger in his land .
the children that are be@@ gotten of them shall enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord in their third generation .
but it shall be , when evening co@@ me@@ th on , he shall was@@ h himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt have a place also without the camp , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth abroad :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have a p@@ add@@ le upon TH@@ Y weapon ; and it shall be , when th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t ease th@@ y@@ self abroad , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g there@@ with , and s@@ halt turn back and cover that which co@@ me@@ th from the@@ e :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not deliver un@@ to his master the ser@@ vant which is escaped from his master un@@ to the@@ e :
he shall d@@ well with the@@ e , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of TH@@ Y gates , where it lik@@ eth him best : th@@ ou s@@ halt not op@@ press him .
there shall be no wh@@ ore of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Israel , nor a so@@ dom@@ ite of the sons of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not lend upon us@@ ury to TH@@ Y brother ; us@@ ury of money , us@@ ury of vic@@ tuals , us@@ ury of any thing that is l@@ ent upon us@@ ury :
but if th@@ ou s@@ halt for@@ bear to vo@@ w , it shall be no sin in the@@ e .
that which is gone out of TH@@ Y li@@ ps th@@ ou s@@ halt keep and perform ; even a fre@@ e@@ will offering , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised with TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into TH@@ Y neighbour 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then th@@ ou may@@ est eat grap@@ es TH@@ Y fill at th@@ ine own pleas@@ ure ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not put any in TH@@ Y ves@@ sel .
and when she is depar@@ ted out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his bre@@ th@@ ren of the children of Israel , and mak@@ eth mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of him , or sel@@ le@@ th him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt put ev@@ il away from among you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that th@@ ou observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so ye shall observe to do .
remember what the Lord TH@@ Y God did un@@ to Mi@@ ri@@ am by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt stand abroad , and the man to whom th@@ ou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad un@@ to the@@ e .
in any case th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sle@@ ep in his own ra@@ im@@ ent , and b@@ less the@@ e : and it shall be righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to the@@ e before the Lord TH@@ Y God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not op@@ press an hired ser@@ vant that is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , or of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers that are in TH@@ Y land within TH@@ Y gates :
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not per@@ ver@@ t the judgment of the st@@ ran@@ ger , nor of the fa@@ ther@@ less ; nor take a wi@@ dow 's ra@@ im@@ ent to pledge :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in Egypt , and the Lord TH@@ Y God re@@ deemed the@@ e th@@ ence : therefore I command the@@ e to do this thing .
when th@@ ou be@@ atest th@@ ine olive tree , th@@ ou s@@ halt not go over the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s again : it shall be for the st@@ ran@@ ger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
when th@@ ou gather@@ est the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , th@@ ou s@@ halt not g@@ le@@ an it after@@ ward : it shall be for the st@@ ran@@ ger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in the land of Egypt : therefore I command the@@ e to do this thing .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come un@@ to judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righ@@ te@@ ous , and condemn the w@@ ic@@ ked .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
and it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born which she be@@ aret@@ h shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the el@@ ders of his city shall call him , and speak un@@ to him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
and his name shall be called in Israel , The house of him that hat@@ h his sho@@ e lo@@ os@@ ed .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt cut off her hand , th@@ ine eye shall not p@@ ity her .
for all that do such things , and all that do un@@ righ@@ te@@ ously , are an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
remember what A@@ mal@@ ek did un@@ to the@@ e by the way , when ye were come forth out of Egypt ;
how he met the@@ e by the way , and smo@@ te the hin@@ d@@ most of the@@ e , even all that were fe@@ e@@ ble behind the@@ e , when th@@ ou w@@ ast fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he fear@@ ed not God .
and the pri@@ est shall take the bas@@ ket out of th@@ ine hand , and set it down before the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
and when we cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord God of our fa@@ thers , the Lord heard our voice , and looked on our aff@@ li@@ ction , and our labour , and our op@@ pression :
and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great ter@@ ri@@ b@@ len@@ ess , and with signs , and with won@@ ders :
and he hat@@ h brought us into this place , and hat@@ h given us this land , even a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
and now , be@@ hold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of the land , which th@@ ou , O Lord , h@@ ast given me . and th@@ ou s@@ halt set it before the Lord TH@@ Y God , and worship before the Lord TH@@ Y God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in every good thing which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to th@@ ine house , th@@ ou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that is among you .
look down from TH@@ Y hol@@ y habi@@ tation , from heav@@ en , and b@@ less TH@@ Y people Israel , and the land which th@@ ou h@@ ast given us , as th@@ ou s@@ war@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
this day the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e to do these stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments : th@@ ou s@@ halt therefore keep and do them with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
and the Lord hat@@ h av@@ ou@@ ched the@@ e this day to be his pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people , as he hat@@ h promised the@@ e , and that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments ;
and Mos@@ es with the el@@ ders of Israel comman@@ ded the people , saying , keep all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt set the@@ e up great stones , and pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister :
and there s@@ halt th@@ ou build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , an alt@@ ar of stones : th@@ ou s@@ halt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt build the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God of whole stones : and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer peace offer@@ ings , and s@@ halt eat there , and re@@ jo@@ ice before the Lord TH@@ Y God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore obe@@ y the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and do his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes , which I command the@@ e this day .
these shall stand upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im to b@@ less the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and L@@ evi , and Ju@@ da@@ h , and Is@@ sac@@ har , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall speak , and say un@@ to all the men of Israel with a l@@ oud voice ,
Cur@@ sed be he that li@@ eth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
and all these b@@ les@@ s@@ ings shall come on the@@ e , and over@@ take the@@ e , if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
b@@ les@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the city , and b@@ les@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the field .
b@@ les@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y ground , and the fruit of TH@@ Y c@@ attle , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
b@@ les@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st in , and b@@ les@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be when th@@ ou go@@ est out .
the Lord shall cause th@@ ine enem@@ ies that rise up against the@@ e to be s@@ mit@@ ten before TH@@ Y face : they shall come out against the@@ e one way , and flee before the@@ e seven ways .
the Lord shall command the b@@ les@@ sing upon the@@ e in TH@@ Y sto@@ re@@ houses , and in all that th@@ ou set@@ test th@@ ine hand un@@ to ; and he shall b@@ less the@@ e in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
the Lord shall establish the@@ e an hol@@ y people un@@ to himself , as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to the@@ e , if th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and walk in his ways .
and all people of the ear@@ th shall see that th@@ ou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of the@@ e .
Cur@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the city , and Cur@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the field .
Cur@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y land , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
Cur@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st in , and Cur@@ sed s@@ halt th@@ ou be when th@@ ou go@@ est out .
the Lord shall make the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce cle@@ ave un@@ to the@@ e , until he have consu@@ med the@@ e from off the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
and TH@@ Y heav@@ en that is over TH@@ Y head shall be br@@ ass , and the ear@@ th that is under the@@ e shall be iron .
the Lord shall make the rain of TH@@ Y land pow@@ der and d@@ ust : from heav@@ en shall it come down upon the@@ e , until th@@ ou be destroyed .
and TH@@ Y car@@ case shall be meat un@@ to all fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and no man shall fra@@ y them away .
the Lord will sm@@ ite the@@ e with the bot@@ ch of Egypt , and with the emer@@ ods , and with the sc@@ a@@ b , and with the it@@ ch , where@@ of th@@ ou can@@ st not be he@@ aled .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e with mad@@ ness , and b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , and ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment of heart :

T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : th@@ ou s@@ halt build an house , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not d@@ well there@@ in : th@@ ou s@@ halt plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and s@@ halt not gather the grap@@ es there@@ of .
TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given un@@ to another people , and th@@ ine eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in th@@ ine hand .
the fruit of TH@@ Y land , and all TH@@ Y la@@ bour@@ s , shall a nation which th@@ ou know@@ est not eat up ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be only op@@ pressed and cr@@ us@@ hed al@@ way :
so that th@@ ou s@@ halt be ma@@ d for the sight of th@@ ine eyes which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bot@@ ch that can@@ not be he@@ aled , from the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot un@@ to the top of TH@@ Y head .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt become an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , a pro@@ ver@@ b , and a by@@ word , among all nations w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord shall lead the@@ e .

he shall lend to the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be the ta@@ il .
because th@@ ou serv@@ ed@@ st not the Lord TH@@ Y God with jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , and with gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , for the ab@@ und@@ ance of all things ;
if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that th@@ ou may@@ est fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , the Lord TH@@ Y God ;
then the Lord will make TH@@ Y plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and sor@@ e si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
moreover he will bring upon the@@ e all the diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou w@@ ast afraid of ; and they shall cle@@ ave un@@ to the@@ e .
also every si@@ ck@@ ness , and every pla@@ gue , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the Lord bring upon the@@ e , until th@@ ou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heav@@ en for multi@@ tude ; because th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
and the Lord shall sc@@ at@@ ter the@@ e among all people , from the one end of the ear@@ th even un@@ to the other ; and there th@@ ou s@@ halt serve other go@@ ds , which neither th@@ ou nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations s@@ halt th@@ ou find no ease , neither shall the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot have rest : but the Lord shall give the@@ e there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and sor@@ row of mind :
and TH@@ Y life shall han@@ g in doubt before the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt fear day and night , and s@@ halt have none assur@@ ance of TH@@ Y life :
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , bes@@ ide the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
and Mos@@ es called un@@ to all Israel , and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all his servants , and un@@ to all his land ;
yet the Lord hat@@ h not given you an heart to perce@@ ive , and eyes to see , and e@@ ars to hear , un@@ to this day .
and I have led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : your clo@@ th@@ es are not wa@@ x@@ en old upon you , and TH@@ Y sho@@ e is not wa@@ x@@ en old upon TH@@ Y fo@@ ot .
and when ye came un@@ to this place , S@@ ih@@ on the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an , came out against us un@@ to battle , and we smo@@ te them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
keep therefore the words of this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and do them , that ye may prosp@@ er in all that ye do .
that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest enter into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the Lord TH@@ Y God , and into his oath , which the Lord TH@@ Y God mak@@ eth with the@@ e this day :
neither with you only do I make this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and this oath ;
( for ye know how we have d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt ; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ;
and ye have seen their ab@@ omin@@ ations , and their id@@ ols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them : )
and the Lord shall separate him un@@ to ev@@ il out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that are written in this book of the law :
then men shall say , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
for they went and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them , go@@ ds whom they knew not , and whom he had not given un@@ to them :
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against this land , to bring upon it all the cur@@ ses that are written in this book :
and the Lord rooted them out of their land in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
the secret things belong un@@ to the Lord our God : but those things which are revealed belong un@@ to us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
if any of th@@ ine be driven out un@@ to the out@@ most parts of heav@@ en , from th@@ ence will the Lord TH@@ Y God gather the@@ e , and from th@@ ence will he f@@ et@@ ch the@@ e :
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will bring the@@ e into the land which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers poss@@ essed , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess it ; and he will do the@@ e good , and multi@@ ply the@@ e above TH@@ Y fa@@ thers .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will circum@@ c@@ ise th@@ ine heart , and the heart of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , to love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , that th@@ ou may@@ est live .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will put all these cur@@ ses upon th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and on them that h@@ ate the@@ e , which persec@@ uted the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt return and obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , and do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day .
neither is it beyond the sea , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , Wh@@ o shall go over the sea for us , and bring it un@@ to us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very n@@ igh un@@ to the@@ e , in TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and in TH@@ Y heart , that th@@ ou may@@ est do it .
see , I have set before the@@ e this day life and good , and death and ev@@ il ;
but if th@@ ine heart turn away , so that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not hear , but s@@ halt be drawn away , and worship other go@@ ds , and serve them ;
I den@@ oun@@ ce un@@ to you this day , that ye shall su@@ rely per@@ ish , and that ye shall not prol@@ ong your days upon the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est over Jordan to go to poss@@ ess it .
and Mos@@ es went and sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all Israel .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord TH@@ Y God , he will go over before the@@ e , and he will destroy these nations from before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess them : and Jos@@ hua , he shall go over before the@@ e , as the Lord hat@@ h said .
and the Lord shall do un@@ to them as he did to S@@ ih@@ on and to O@@ g , kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and un@@ to the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and the Lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do un@@ to them according un@@ to all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I have comman@@ ded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God , he it is that do@@ th go with the@@ e ; he will not fail the@@ e , nor for@@ sake the@@ e .
and the Lord , he it is that do@@ th go before the@@ e ; he will be with the@@ e , he will not fail the@@ e , neither for@@ sake the@@ e : fear not , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
and Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it un@@ to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and un@@ to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
and Mos@@ es comman@@ ded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the so@@ lem@@ n@@ ity of the year of release , in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which he shall choose , th@@ ou s@@ halt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and the Lord appeared in the tab@@ ern@@ acle in a pil@@ lar of a cl@@ oud : and the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud stood over the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ ils which they shall have w@@ rought , in that they are turned un@@ to other go@@ ds .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and te@@ ach it the children of Israel : put it in their m@@ ou@@ ths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
Mos@@ es therefore wrote this song the same day , and ta@@ ught it the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that Mos@@ es comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes , which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , saying ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for a witness against the@@ e .
gather un@@ to me all the el@@ ders of your tri@@ bes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their e@@ ars , and call heav@@ en and ear@@ th to record against them .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel the words of this song , until they were ended .
my doc@@ tr@@ ine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall dis@@ til as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender her@@ b , and as the sho@@ wers upon the gr@@ ass :
because I will publish the name of the Lord : as@@ cri@@ be ye gre@@ at@@ ness un@@ to our God .
he is the Rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a God of truth and without in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , just and right is he .
do ye thus requ@@ ite the Lord , O fo@@ ol@@ ish people and un@@ wise ? is not he TH@@ Y father that hat@@ h bought the@@ e ? hat@@ h he not made the@@ e , and established the@@ e ?
remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask TH@@ Y father , and he will she@@ w the@@ e ; TH@@ Y el@@ ders , and they will tell the@@ e .
for the Lord 's portion is his people ; Jac@@ o@@ b is the lot of his inher@@ it@@ ance .
he found him in a de@@ sert land , and in the waste ho@@ w@@ ling w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; he led him about , he instruc@@ ted him , he kept him as the app@@ le of his eye .
so the Lord alone did lead him , and there was no st@@ range go@@ d with him .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , and oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
but J@@ es@@ hur@@ un wa@@ xed f@@ at , and kicked : th@@ ou art wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at , th@@ ou art grown th@@ ick , th@@ ou art covered with fat@@ ness ; then he for@@ so@@ ok God which made him , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed the Rock of his sal@@ vation .
they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with st@@ range go@@ ds , with ab@@ omin@@ ations provoked they him to an@@ ger .
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to dev@@ ils , not to God ; to go@@ ds whom they knew not , to new go@@ ds that came newly up , whom your fa@@ thers fear@@ ed not .
of the Rock that beg@@ at the@@ e th@@ ou art un@@ min@@ d@@ ful , and h@@ ast forgotten God that formed the@@ e .
and when the Lord saw it , he ab@@ hor@@ red them , because of the prov@@ oking of his sons , and of his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very fro@@ ward generation , children in whom is no faith .
for a fire is kin@@ d@@ led in mine an@@ ger , and shall bur@@ n un@@ to the lowest hell , and shall consum@@ e the ear@@ th with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
the s@@ word without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the vir@@ gin , the su@@ ck@@ ling also with the man of gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s .
I said , I would sc@@ at@@ ter them into cor@@ ners , I would make the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of them to ce@@ ase from among men :
O that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
for their v@@ ine is of the v@@ ine of So@@ dom , and of the fields of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h : their grap@@ es are grap@@ es of g@@ all , their clu@@ sters are bitter :
their wine is the po@@ ison of dra@@ g@@ ons , and the cru@@ el ven@@ om of as@@ ps .
to me belon@@ get@@ h ven@@ ge@@ ance , and re@@ comp@@ ence ; their fo@@ ot shall sli@@ de in due time : for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make has@@ te .
for the Lord shall judge his people , and rep@@ ent himself for his servants , when he se@@ eth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
which did eat the f@@ at of their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and d@@ rank the wine of their drink offer@@ ings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
if I wh@@ et my g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to mine enem@@ ies , and will reward them that h@@ ate me .
I will make mine ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood , and my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h ; and that with the blood of the sla@@ in and of the cap@@ tives , from the beginning of reven@@ ges upon the enemy .
and Mos@@ es came and sp@@ ake all the words of this song in the e@@ ars of the people , he , and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of nun .
for it is not a v@@ ain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prol@@ ong your days in the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over Jordan to poss@@ ess it .
and die in the mount w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est up , and be gathered un@@ to TH@@ Y people ; as Aaron TH@@ Y brother died in mount H@@ or , and was gathered un@@ to his people :
because ye t@@ res@@ passed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because ye sanc@@ ti@@ fied me not in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
yet th@@ ou s@@ halt see the land before the@@ e ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not go th@@ ither un@@ to the land which I give the children of Israel .
and this is the b@@ les@@ sing , where@@ with Mos@@ es the man of God b@@ les@@ sed the children of Israel before his death .
Ye@@ a , he lov@@ ed the people ; all his sa@@ ints are in TH@@ Y hand : and they sat down at TH@@ Y feet ; every one shall receive of TH@@ Y words .
they shall te@@ ach Jac@@ o@@ b TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , and Israel TH@@ Y law : they shall put incen@@ se before the@@ e , and whole bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice upon th@@ ine alt@@ ar .
and of Joseph he said , b@@ les@@ sed of the Lord be his land , for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of heav@@ en , for the dew , and for the deep that cou@@ ch@@ eth ben@@ e@@ ath ,
and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fru@@ its brought forth by the sun , and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things put forth by the moon ,
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains , and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of the lasting hil@@ ls ,
they shall call the people un@@ to the mountain ; there they shall offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for they shall su@@ ck of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , and of treasures hi@@ d in the s@@ and .
there is none like un@@ to the God of J@@ es@@ hur@@ un , who ri@@ de@@ th upon the heav@@ en in TH@@ Y help , and in his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy on the sky .
Israel then shall d@@ well in safety alone : the fo@@ un@@ tain of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be upon a land of cor@@ n and wine ; also his heav@@ ens shall drop down dew .
and Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b un@@ to the mountain of N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . and the Lord she@@ wed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to Dan ,
and the south , and the pla@@ in of the val@@ ley of Jer@@ ich@@ o , the city of pal@@ m trees , un@@ to Zo@@ ar .
so Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord died there in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , according to the word of the Lord .
and he buried him in a val@@ ley in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , over against Beth @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : but no man know@@ eth of his se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re un@@ to this day .
and Mos@@ es was an hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force ab@@ ated .
and the children of Israel we@@ pt for Mos@@ es in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b thirty days : so the days of we@@ eping and mourning for Mos@@ es were ended .
and there ar@@ ose not a pro@@ phe@@ t since in Israel like un@@ to Mos@@ es , whom the Lord knew face to face ,
and in all that m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and in all the great terror which Mos@@ es she@@ wed in the sight of all Israel .
now after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' minister , saying ,
Mos@@ es my ser@@ vant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , th@@ ou , and all this people , un@@ to the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad upon , that have I given un@@ to you , as I said un@@ to Mos@@ es .
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and this Lebanon even un@@ to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and un@@ to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
be strong and of a good courage : for un@@ to this people s@@ halt th@@ ou divide for an inher@@ it@@ ance the land , which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers to give them .
have not I comman@@ ded the@@ e ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be th@@ ou dis@@ may@@ ed : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou go@@ est .
and to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , sp@@ ake Jos@@ hua , saying ,
remember the word which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded you , saying , The Lord your God hat@@ h given you rest , and hat@@ h given you this land .
according as we hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to Mos@@ es in all things , so will we he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e : only the Lord TH@@ Y God be with the@@ e , as he was with Mos@@ es .
and it was told the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o , saying , be@@ hold , there came men in hi@@ ther to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
and the woman took the two men , and hi@@ d them , and said thus , There came men un@@ to me , but I w@@ ist not wh@@ ence they were :
and it came to pass about the time of sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : w@@ hi@@ ther the men went I wo@@ t not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall over@@ take them .
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of of the house , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order upon the ro@@ of .
and the men pursu@@ ed after them the way to Jordan un@@ to the for@@ ds : and as soon as they which pursu@@ ed after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and before they were laid down , she came up un@@ to them upon the ro@@ of ;
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she d@@ wel@@ t upon the wall .
and she said un@@ to them , G@@ et you to the mountain , lest the pursu@@ ers meet you ; and hide yo@@ ur@@ selves there three days , until the pursu@@ ers be returned : and after@@ ward may ye go your way .
and the men said un@@ to her , We will be bla@@ me@@ less of this th@@ ine oath which th@@ ou h@@ ast made us swe@@ ar .
and if th@@ ou ut@@ ter this our business , then we will be quit of th@@ ine oath which th@@ ou h@@ ast made us to swe@@ ar .
and she said , Accor@@ ding un@@ to your words , so be it . and she sent them away , and they depar@@ ted : and she bound the scar@@ let line in the window .
and they went , and came un@@ to the mountain , and abo@@ de there three days , until the pursu@@ ers were returned : and the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
so the two men returned , and des@@ cen@@ ded from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and told him all things that be@@ fell them :
and Jos@@ hua rose early in the morning ; and they removed from Sh@@ it@@ tim , and came to Jordan , he and all the children of Israel , and lo@@ d@@ ged there before they passed over .
and it came to pass after three days , that the officers went through the host ;
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , When ye see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the pri@@ ests , saying , T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and went before the people .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt command the pri@@ ests that bear the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , saying , When ye are come to the br@@ ink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
be@@ hold , the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord of all the ear@@ th pass@@ eth over before you into Jordan .
and it came to pass , when the people removed from their ten@@ ts , to pass over Jordan , and the pri@@ ests bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant before the people ;
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over Jordan , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
then Jos@@ hua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tri@@ be a man :
that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask their fa@@ thers in time to come , saying , What mean ye by these stones ?
and Jos@@ hua set up twelve stones in the mid@@ st of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the pri@@ ests which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant stood : and they are there un@@ to this day .
and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the children of G@@ ad , and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to them :
about for@@ ty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord un@@ to battle , to the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
on that day the Lord mag@@ ni@@ fied Jos@@ hua in the sight of all Israel ; and they fear@@ ed him , as they fear@@ ed Mos@@ es , all the days of his life .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ ilg@@ al , in the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and those twelve stones , which they took out of Jordan , did Jos@@ hua pit@@ ch in G@@ ilg@@ al .
and he sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fa@@ thers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
then ye shall let your children know , saying , Israel came over this Jordan on d@@ ry land .
and Jos@@ hua made him sharp k@@ ni@@ ves , and circum@@ c@@ ised the children of Israel at the hill of the fo@@ res@@ kins .
now all the people that came out were circum@@ c@@ ised : but all the people that were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circum@@ c@@ ised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them by the way .
and it came to pass , when they had done circum@@ c@@ ising all the people , that they abo@@ de in their places in the camp , ti@@ ll they were whole .
and the Lord said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , This day have I rol@@ led away the re@@ pro@@ ach of Egypt from off you . W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the name of the place is called G@@ ilg@@ al un@@ to this day .
and the children of Israel en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ ilg@@ al , and kept the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month at even in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and they did eat of the old cor@@ n of the land on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over , un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es , and par@@ ched cor@@ n in the sel@@ f@@ same day .
and the captain of the Lord 's host said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , Lo@@ ose TH@@ Y sho@@ e from off TH@@ Y fo@@ ot ; for the place where@@ on th@@ ou stan@@ dest is hol@@ y . and Jos@@ hua did so .
now Jer@@ ich@@ o was stra@@ it@@ ly shut up because of the children of Israel : none went out , and none came in .
and the Lord said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , Se@@ e , I have given into th@@ ine hand Jer@@ ich@@ o , and the king there@@ of , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and ye shall comp@@ ass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do six days .
and seven pri@@ ests shall bear before the Ar@@ k seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns : and the seventh day ye shall comp@@ ass the city seven times , and the pri@@ ests shall blow with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun called the pri@@ ests , and said un@@ to them , T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and let seven pri@@ ests bear seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns before the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and the armed men went before the pri@@ ests that ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward came after the Ar@@ k , the pri@@ ests going on , and b@@ low@@ ing with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
so the Ar@@ k of the Lord comp@@ ass@@ ed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lo@@ d@@ ged in the camp .
and Jos@@ hua rose early in the morning , and the pri@@ ests took up the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the pri@@ ests ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , Jos@@ hua said un@@ to the people , sh@@ out ; for the Lord hat@@ h given you the city .
and ye , in any wise keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the accur@@ sed thing , lest ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves accur@@ sed , when ye take of the accur@@ sed thing , and make the camp of Israel a cur@@ se , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of br@@ ass and iron , are consec@@ rated un@@ to the Lord : they shall come into the treas@@ ury of the Lord .
and they ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and o@@ x , and she@@ ep , and ass , with the edge of the s@@ word .
but Jos@@ hua had said un@@ to the two men that had sp@@ ied out the country , G@@ o into the har@@ lot 's house , and bring out th@@ ence the woman , and all that she hat@@ h , as ye sw@@ are un@@ to her .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was there@@ in : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron , they put into the treas@@ ury of the house of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Israel even un@@ to this day ; because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , which Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
so there went up th@@ ither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of A@@ I .
and Jos@@ hua rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and fell to the ear@@ th upon his face before the Ar@@ k of the Lord until the ev@@ enti@@ de , he and the el@@ ders of Israel , and put d@@ ust upon their heads .
so Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tri@@ bes ; and the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h was taken :
and he brought the family of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he took the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes : and he brought the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes man by man ; and Z@@ ab@@ di was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was taken .
so Jos@@ hua sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and they ran un@@ to the tent ; and , be@@ hold , it was hi@@ d in his tent , and the silver under it .
and they took them out of the mid@@ st of the tent , and brought them un@@ to Jos@@ hua , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up against A@@ I : and Jos@@ hua chose out thirty thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and sent them away by night .
( for they will come out after us ) ti@@ ll we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
then ye shall rise up from the amb@@ ush , and se@@ ize upon the city : for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have comman@@ ded you .
Jos@@ hua therefore sent them forth : and they went to lie in amb@@ ush , and abo@@ de between Be@@ the@@ l and A@@ I , on the west side of A@@ I : but Jos@@ hua lo@@ d@@ ged that night among the people .
and Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning , and num@@ ber@@ ed the people , and went up , he and the el@@ ders of Israel , before the people to A@@ I .
and he took about five thousand men , and set them to lie in amb@@ ush between Be@@ the@@ l and A@@ I , on the west side of the city .
and Jos@@ hua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and all the people that were in A@@ I were called together to pursue after them : and they pursu@@ ed after Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
and there was not a man left in A@@ I or Be@@ the@@ l , that went not out after Israel : and they left the city open , and pursu@@ ed after Israel .
and the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and has@@ ted and set the city on fire .
and when Jos@@ hua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city as@@ cen@@ ded , then they turned again , and sle@@ w the men of A@@ I .
and so it was , that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of A@@ I .
for Jos@@ hua drew not his hand back , where@@ with he stret@@ ched out the spe@@ ar , until he had ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ I .
only the c@@ attle and the sp@@ oil of that city Israel took for a pre@@ y un@@ to themselves , according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua .
and he wrote there upon the stones a cop@@ y of the law of Mos@@ es , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
and after@@ ward he read all the words of the law , the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings and cur@@ s@@ ings , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
and when the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ on heard what Jos@@ hua had done un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o and to A@@ I ,
they did work w@@ il@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their ass@@ es , and wine bott@@ les , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and old sho@@ es and cl@@ ou@@ ted upon their feet , and old gar@@ ments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was d@@ ry and mo@@ ul@@ dy .
and they went to Jos@@ hua un@@ to the camp at G@@ ilg@@ al , and said un@@ to him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said un@@ to him , From a very far country TH@@ Y servants are come because of the name of the Lord TH@@ Y God : for we have heard the f@@ ame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that were beyond Jordan , to S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and to O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , which was at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go un@@ to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and it is mo@@ ul@@ dy :
and these bott@@ les of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , be@@ hold , they be rent : and these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the men took of their vic@@ tuals , and asked not coun@@ sel at the m@@ outh of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua made peace with them , and made a league with them , to let them live : and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation sw@@ are un@@ to them .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they d@@ wel@@ t among them .
and the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and came un@@ to their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gi@@ be@@ on , and C@@ hep@@ hi@@ ra@@ h , and Be@@ ero@@ th , and Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im .
and the children of Israel smo@@ te them not , because the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation had sworn un@@ to them by the Lord God of Israel . and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation mur@@ mu@@ red against the pr@@ inces .
but all the pr@@ inces said un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , We have sworn un@@ to them by the Lord God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
this we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wr@@ ath be upon us , because of the oath which we sw@@ are un@@ to them .
and Jos@@ hua called for them , and he sp@@ ake un@@ to them , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have ye be@@ gu@@ iled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye d@@ well among us ?
now therefore ye are Cur@@ sed , and there shall none of you be fre@@ ed from being bon@@ d@@ men , and he@@ wers of wood and Dra@@ wers of water for the house of my God .
and now , be@@ hold , we are in th@@ ine hand : as it se@@ eme@@ th good and right un@@ to the@@ e to do un@@ to us , do .
and so did he un@@ to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they sle@@ w them not .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ zede@@ k king of Jer@@ usalem sent un@@ to Ho@@ ham king of He@@ br@@ on , and un@@ to Pi@@ ram king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , and un@@ to Jap@@ hi@@ a king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and un@@ to De@@ bir king of Eg@@ lon , saying ,
so Jos@@ hua as@@ cen@@ ded from G@@ ilg@@ al , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them before Israel , and sle@@ w them with a great sla@@ ughter at Gi@@ be@@ on , and ch@@ ased them along the way that go@@ eth up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on , and smo@@ te them to Az@@ ek@@ ah , and un@@ to Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah .
and there was no day like that before it or after it , that the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to the voice of a man : for the Lord fought for Israel .
and Jos@@ hua returned , and all Israel with him , un@@ to the camp to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and stay ye not , but pursue after your enem@@ ies , and sm@@ ite the hin@@ d@@ most of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the Lord your God hat@@ h delivered them into your hand .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing them with a very great sla@@ ughter , ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med , that the rest which remained of them entered into f@@ enced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings un@@ to him out of the cave , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
and Jos@@ hua said un@@ to them , Fe@@ ar not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the Lord do to all your enem@@ ies against whom ye fight .
and after@@ ward Jos@@ hua smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them , and han@@ ged them on five trees : and they were han@@ ging upon the trees until the evening .
then Jos@@ hua passed from Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah , and all Israel with him , un@@ to Lib@@ n@@ ah , and fought against Lib@@ n@@ ah :
and Jos@@ hua passed from Lib@@ n@@ ah , and all Israel with him , un@@ to L@@ ach@@ ish , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it , and fought against it :
and from L@@ ach@@ ish Jos@@ hua passed un@@ to Eg@@ lon , and all Israel with him ; and they en@@ camp@@ ed against it , and fought against it :
and Jos@@ hua went up from Eg@@ lon , and all Israel with him , un@@ to He@@ br@@ on ; and they fought against it :
and Jos@@ hua returned , and all Israel with him , to De@@ bir ; and fought against it :
and Jos@@ hua smo@@ te them from K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea even un@@ to Gaza , and all the country of Gos@@ h@@ en , even un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ on .
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the pla@@ ins south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , and in the val@@ ley , and in the borders of D@@ or on the west ,
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the s@@ and that is upon the sea shore in multi@@ tude , with hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots very many .
and when all these kings were met together , they came and pit@@ ched together at the waters of Mer@@ om , to fight against Israel .
and the Lord said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , Be not afraid because of them : for to mor@@ row about this time will I deliver them up all sla@@ in before Israel : th@@ ou s@@ halt h@@ ough their hor@@ ses , and bur@@ n their char@@ i@@ ots with fire .
so Jos@@ hua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Mer@@ om su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ; and they fell upon them .
and Jos@@ hua did un@@ to them as the Lord b@@ ade him : he h@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed their hor@@ ses , and bur@@ n@@ t their char@@ i@@ ots with fire .
and Jos@@ hua at that time turned back , and took Haz@@ or , and smo@@ te the king there@@ of with the s@@ word : for Haz@@ or be@@ fore@@ time was the head of all those k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms .
and they smo@@ te all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in with the edge of the s@@ word , ut@@ ter@@ ly destroying them : there was not any left to bre@@ a@@ the : and he bur@@ n@@ t Haz@@ or with fire .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Haz@@ or only ; that did Jos@@ hua bur@@ n .
as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant , so did Mos@@ es command Jos@@ hua , and so did Jos@@ hua ; he left nothing und@@ one of all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ on : all other they took in battle .
there was none of the An@@ ak@@ ims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , there remained .
and the coast of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , which was of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the gi@@ ants , that d@@ wel@@ t at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
them did Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord gave it for a possession un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o , one ; the king of A@@ I , which is bes@@ ide Be@@ the@@ l , one ;

the king of K@@ ede@@ sh , one ; the king of Jok@@ ne@@ am of Car@@ mel , one ;
the king of D@@ or in the coast of D@@ or , one ; the king of the nations of G@@ ilg@@ al , one ;
this is the land that yet remain@@ eth : all the borders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all G@@ es@@ hur@@ i ,
from the south , all the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and M@@ ear@@ ah that is bes@@ ide the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , un@@ to A@@ ph@@ ek , to the borders of the Am@@ ori@@ tes :
and the land of the G@@ ib@@ li@@ tes , and all Lebanon , toward the sun@@ rising , from Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ g@@ ad under mount Her@@ mon un@@ to the entering into Ham@@ ath .
with whom the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and the G@@ adi@@ tes have received their inher@@ it@@ ance , which Mos@@ es gave them , beyond Jordan eas@@ tw@@ ard , even as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord gave them ;
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is upon the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba un@@ to Di@@ bon ;
and all the cities of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which re@@ ig@@ ned in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , un@@ to the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and all mount Her@@ mon , and all B@@ ash@@ an un@@ to Sal@@ ca@@ h ;
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : but the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites d@@ well among the Isra@@ eli@@ tes until this day .
only un@@ to the tri@@ be of L@@ evi he gave none inher@@ it@@ ance ; the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inher@@ it@@ ance , as he said un@@ to them .
and Mos@@ es gave un@@ to the tri@@ be of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en inher@@ it@@ ance according to their families .
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and all her cities that are in the pla@@ in ; Di@@ bon , and B@@ am@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on ,
and Beth @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , and Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th ,
Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ er , did the children of Israel s@@ lay with the s@@ word among them that were sla@@ in by them .
and the border of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en was Jordan , and the border there@@ of . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en after their families , the cities and the villages there@@ of .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , even un@@ to the children of G@@ ad according to their families .
and their coast was Jaz@@ er , and all the cities of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and half the land of the children of Am@@ mon , un@@ to A@@ ro@@ er that is before R@@ ab@@ bah ;
and from H@@ es@@ h@@ bon un@@ to Ram@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ m@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and Bet@@ on@@ im ; and from Mah@@ an@@ aim un@@ to the border of De@@ bir ;
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of G@@ ad after their families , the cities , and their villages .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : and this was the possession of the half tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families .
and their coast was from Mah@@ an@@ aim , all B@@ ash@@ an , all the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , and all the towns of J@@ air , which are in B@@ ash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core cities :
these are the countries which Mos@@ es did distri@@ bute for inher@@ it@@ ance in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , on the other side Jordan , by Jer@@ ich@@ o , eas@@ tw@@ ard .
by lot was their inher@@ it@@ ance , as the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es , for the nine tri@@ bes , and for the half tri@@ be .
for Mos@@ es had given the inher@@ it@@ ance of two tri@@ bes and an half tri@@ be on the other side Jordan : but un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes he gave none inher@@ it@@ ance among them .
as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so the children of Israel did , and they divided the land .
for@@ ty years old was I when Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord sent me from K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea to es@@ p@@ y out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
He@@ br@@ on therefore became the inher@@ it@@ ance of Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h the Ken@@ ez@@ ite un@@ to this day , because that he wh@@ ol@@ ly followed the Lord God of Israel .
this then was the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south coast .
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that lo@@ ok@@ eth sou@@ th@@ ward :
and the east border was the salt sea , even un@@ to the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the ut@@ ter@@ most part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ la , and passed along by the north of Beth @@@ -@@ @ arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill un@@ to the fo@@ un@@ tain of the water of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border was drawn to Ba@@ al@@ ah , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im :
and the border comp@@ ass@@ ed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to mount Se@@ ir , and passed along un@@ to the side of mount J@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast there@@ of . this is the coast of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h round about according to their families .
and he went up th@@ ence to the inhabitants of De@@ bir : and the name of De@@ bir before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ se@@ p@@ her .
and O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , the brother of Cal@@ e@@ b , took it : and he gave him A@@ ch@@ sa@@ h his daughter to wife .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their families .
and the ut@@ ter@@ most cities of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h toward the coast of E@@ dom sou@@ th@@ ward were Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , and E@@ der , and Jag@@ ur ,
and L@@ eb@@ a@@ o@@ th , and Sh@@ il@@ him , and A@@ in , and R@@ im@@ mon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
from E@@ kr@@ on even un@@ to the sea , all that lay near Ash@@ do@@ d , with their villages :
Ash@@ do@@ d with her towns and her villages , Gaza with her towns and her villages , un@@ to the river of Egypt , and the great sea , and the border there@@ of :
and Hum@@ ta@@ h , and Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , which is He@@ br@@ on , and Z@@ ior ; nine cities with their villages :
and Ma@@ ar@@ ath , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ ano@@ th , and El@@ tek@@ on ; six cities with their villages :
and N@@ ib@@ sh@@ an , and the city of Sal@@ t , and En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di ; six cities with their villages .
as for the Je@@ bu@@ sites the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , the children of Ju@@ da@@ h could not drive them out : but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h at Jer@@ usalem un@@ to this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jer@@ ich@@ o , un@@ to the water of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that go@@ eth up from Jer@@ ich@@ o throughout mount Be@@ the@@ l ,
and go@@ eth out from Be@@ the@@ l to L@@ uz , and pass@@ eth along un@@ to the borders of Ar@@ chi to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th ,
and go@@ eth down w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the coast of Jap@@ h@@ le@@ ti , un@@ to the coast of Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and to Ge@@ zer : and the go@@ ings out there@@ of are at the sea .
and the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families was thus : even the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance on the east side was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , un@@ to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eas@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and passed by it on the east to Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h ;
and it went down from Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and to Na@@ ar@@ ath , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and went out at Jordan .
the border went out from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im by their families .
and the separate cities for the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were among the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , all the cities with their villages .
and there fell ten por@@ tions to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , bes@@ ide the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an , which were on the other side Jordan ;
and the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from As@@ her to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah , that li@@ eth before Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the border went along on the right hand un@@ to the inhabitants of En @@@ -@@ @ tap@@ pu@@ ah .
now Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had the land of T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah : but T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah on the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h belonged to the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ;
sou@@ th@@ ward it was E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's , and nor@@ th@@ ward it was Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in As@@ her on the north , and in Is@@ sac@@ har on the east .
yet the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were wa@@ x@@ en strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute ; but did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , T@@ ho@@ u art a great people , and h@@ ast great power : th@@ ou s@@ halt not have one lot only :
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel assemb@@ led together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation there . and the land was sub@@ du@@ ed before them .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Ju@@ da@@ h shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
Y@@ e shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the descri@@ ption hi@@ ther to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
and the men went and passed through the land , and described it by cities into seven parts in a book , and came again to Jos@@ hua to the host at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
and Jos@@ hua cast lots for them in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h before the Lord : and there Jos@@ hua divided the land un@@ to the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , and des@@ cen@@ ded to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
and passed along toward the side over against Ara@@ bah nor@@ th@@ ward , and went down un@@ to Ara@@ bah :
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward : and the out@@ go@@ ings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and Jordan was the border of it on the east side . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Benjamin , by the co@@ asts there@@ of round about , according to their families .
now the cities of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jer@@ ich@@ o , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah , and the val@@ ley of K@@ ez@@ iz ,
and Ze@@ lah , Ele@@ p@@ h , and J@@ eb@@ us@@ i , which is Jer@@ usalem , Gi@@ be@@ ath , and Kir@@ j@@ ath ; fo@@ ur@@ teen cities with their villages . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inher@@ it@@ ance was within the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Ba@@ al@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ beer , Ram@@ ath of the south . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families .
and the third lot came up for the children of Ze@@ bul@@ un according to their families : and the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance was un@@ to Sar@@ id :
and their border went up toward the sea , and Mar@@ al@@ ah , and reached to Dab@@ bas@@ het@@ h , and reached to the river that is before Jok@@ ne@@ am ;
and turned from Sar@@ id eas@@ tw@@ ard toward the sun@@ rising un@@ to the border of Ch@@ is@@ lo@@ th @@@ -@@ @ tab@@ or , and then go@@ eth out to da@@ ber@@ ath , and go@@ eth up to Jap@@ hi@@ a ,
and from th@@ ence pass@@ eth on along on the east to G@@ it@@ ta@@ h @@@ -@@ @ hep@@ her , to I@@ t@@ ta@@ h @@@ -@@ @ kaz@@ in , and go@@ eth out to Rem@@ mon @@@ -@@ @ me@@ tho@@ ar to Ne@@ ah ;
and the border comp@@ ass@@ eth it on the north side to H@@ ann@@ athon : and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of are in the val@@ ley of J@@ ip@@ h@@ th@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ el :
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Ze@@ bul@@ un according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and the fourth lot came out to Is@@ sac@@ har , for the children of Is@@ sac@@ har according to their families .
and the coast reac@@ het@@ h to T@@ ab@@ or , and Sha@@ haz@@ im@@ ah , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h ; and the out@@ go@@ ings of their border were at Jordan : six@@ teen cities with their villages .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and the fifth lot came out for the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her according to their families .
and then the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city T@@ y@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of are at the sea from the coast to A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b :
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out to the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , even for the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families .
and their coast was from H@@ ele@@ p@@ h , from Al@@ lon to Za@@ an@@ ann@@ im , and Ad@@ ami , N@@ eke@@ b , and J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el , un@@ to Lak@@ um ; and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of were at Jordan :
and Ir@@ on , and Mig@@ dal @@@ -@@ @ el , Ho@@ rem , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h ; n@@ in@@ ete@@ en cities with their villages .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and the seventh lot came out for the tri@@ be of the children of Dan according to their families .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
when they had made an end of dividing the land for inher@@ it@@ ance by their co@@ asts , the children of Israel gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to Jos@@ hua the son of nun among them :
according to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ser@@ ah in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and he built the city , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in .
the Lord also sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
and they appointed K@@ ede@@ sh in Gal@@ il@@ ee in mount Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and Sh@@ ec@@ hem in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , which is He@@ br@@ on , in the mountain of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and the children of Israel gave un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes out of their inher@@ it@@ ance , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , these cities and their subur@@ bs .
and the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
the children of Mer@@ ari by their families had out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and the children of Israel gave by lot un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes these cities with their subur@@ bs , as the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi , had : for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
but the fields of the city , and the villages there@@ of , gave they to Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h for his possession .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the pri@@ est He@@ br@@ on with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Lib@@ n@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ,
and J@@ at@@ tir with her subur@@ bs , and E@@ sh@@ te@@ mo@@ a with her subur@@ bs ,
and A@@ in with her subur@@ bs , and J@@ ut@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h with her subur@@ bs ; nine cities out of those two tri@@ bes .
and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , Gi@@ be@@ on with her subur@@ bs , Ge@@ ba with her subur@@ bs ,
and the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes which remained of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
for they gave them Sh@@ ec@@ hem with her subur@@ bs in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Ge@@ zer with her subur@@ bs ,
and K@@ ib@@ z@@ aim with her subur@@ bs , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on with her subur@@ bs ; four cities .
and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Tan@@ ach with her subur@@ bs , and G@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ rim@@ mon with her subur@@ bs ; two cities .
and un@@ to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with her subur@@ bs , and Kar@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs ,
so all the cities for the children of Mer@@ ari by their families , which were remaining of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , were by their lot twelve cities .
all the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes within the possession of the children of Israel were for@@ ty and eight cities with their subur@@ bs .
these cities were every one with their subur@@ bs round about them : thus were all these cities .
and the Lord gave un@@ to Israel all the land which he sw@@ are to give un@@ to their fa@@ thers ; and they poss@@ essed it , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in .
there failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken un@@ to the house of Israel ; all came to pass .
and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e have kept all that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded you , and have obe@@ yed my voice in all that I comman@@ ded you :
Y@@ e have not left your bre@@ th@@ ren these many days un@@ to this day , but have kept the charge of the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord your God .
so Jos@@ hua b@@ les@@ sed them , and sent them away : and they went un@@ to their ten@@ ts .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up to war against them .
and with him ten pr@@ inces , of each chief house a pr@@ ince throughout all the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fa@@ thers among the thousands of Israel .
and they came un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , un@@ to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they sp@@ ake with them , saying ,
is the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we are not cleans@@ ed until this day , although there was a pla@@ gue in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord ,
did not A@@ ch@@ an the son of Zer@@ ah commit a t@@ res@@ pass in the accur@@ sed thing , and wr@@ ath fell on all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel ? and that man per@@ ished not alone in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
then the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h answ@@ ered , and said un@@ to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer there@@ on bur@@ n@@ t offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offer@@ ings there@@ on , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak un@@ to our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest un@@ to Israel from all their enem@@ ies round about , that Jos@@ hua wa@@ xed old and stric@@ ken in age .
and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hat@@ h done un@@ to all these nations because of you ; for the Lord your God is he that hat@@ h fought for you .
and the Lord your God , he shall exp@@ el them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall poss@@ ess their land , as the Lord your God hat@@ h promised un@@ to you .
be ye therefore very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that ye turn not aside there@@ from to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to them :
for the Lord hat@@ h driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hat@@ h been able to stand before you un@@ to this day .
one man of you shall ch@@ ase a thousand : for the Lord your God , he it is that figh@@ te@@ th for you , as he hat@@ h promised you .
and Jos@@ hua gathered all the tri@@ bes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the el@@ ders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Ab@@ ra@@ ham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and multi@@ p@@ lied his se@@ ed , and gave him I@@ sa@@ ac .
and I gave un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac Jac@@ o@@ b and E@@ sa@@ u : and I gave un@@ to E@@ sa@@ u mount Se@@ ir , to poss@@ ess it ; but Jac@@ o@@ b and his children went down into Egypt .
I sent Mos@@ es also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and after@@ ward I brought you out .
and I brought your fa@@ thers out of Egypt : and ye came un@@ to the sea ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed after your fa@@ thers with char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men un@@ to the Red sea .
then Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por , king of Mo@@ a@@ b , ar@@ ose and war@@ red against Israel , and sent and called Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or to cur@@ se you :
and the Lord dra@@ ve out from before us all the people , even the Am@@ ori@@ tes which d@@ wel@@ t in the land : therefore will we also serve the Lord ; for he is our God .
and Jos@@ hua said un@@ to the people , Y@@ e can@@ not serve the Lord : for he is an hol@@ y God ; he is a Je@@ al@@ ous God ; he will not for@@ give your trans@@ gres@@ sions nor your sin@@ s .
now therefore put away , said he , the st@@ range go@@ ds which are among you , and inc@@ line your heart un@@ to the Lord God of Israel .
and it came to pass after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ser@@ ah , which is in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north side of the hill of G@@ a@@ ash .
and Ele@@ azar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that per@@ tained to Ph@@ ine@@ has his son , which was given him in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and Ju@@ da@@ h went up ; and the Lord delivered the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes into their hand : and they sle@@ w of them in B@@ ez@@ ek ten thousand men .
but Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ bez@@ ek fled ; and they pursu@@ ed after him , and caught him , and cut off his thum@@ bs and his great to@@ es .
now the children of Ju@@ da@@ h had fought against Jer@@ usalem , and had taken it , and s@@ mit@@ ten it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
and after@@ ward the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , that d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and in the south , and in the val@@ ley .
and from th@@ ence he went against the inhabitants of De@@ bir : and the name of De@@ bir before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ se@@ p@@ her :
and Ju@@ da@@ h went with Simeon his brother , and they sle@@ w the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that inhabited Z@@ ep@@ hat@@ h , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed it . and the name of the city was called Hor@@ ma@@ h .
also Ju@@ da@@ h took Gaza with the coast there@@ of , and As@@ k@@ el@@ on with the coast there@@ of , and E@@ kr@@ on with the coast there@@ of .
and the Lord was with Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he dra@@ ve out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the val@@ ley , because they had char@@ i@@ ots of iron .
and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Je@@ bu@@ sites that inhabited Jer@@ usalem ; but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Benjamin in Jer@@ usalem un@@ to this day .
and the house of Joseph , they also went up against Be@@ the@@ l : and the Lord was with them .
and when he she@@ wed them the entrance into the city , they smo@@ te the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the man went into the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and built a city , and called the name there@@ of L@@ uz : which is the name there@@ of un@@ to this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute , and did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
neither did E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in Ge@@ zer ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t in Ge@@ zer among them .
neither did Ze@@ bul@@ un drive out the inhabitants of Kit@@ ron , nor the inhabitants of Na@@ hal@@ ol ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t among them , and became tri@@ but@@ aries .
neither did As@@ her drive out the inhabitants of Ac@@ cho , nor the inhabitants of Z@@ id@@ on , nor of Ah@@ lab , nor of A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b , nor of Hel@@ bah , nor of Ap@@ hi@@ k , nor of Re@@ ho@@ b :
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the val@@ ley :
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in mount Her@@ es in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became tri@@ but@@ aries .
and the coast of the Am@@ ori@@ tes was from the going up to Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , from the rock , and up@@ ward .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their al@@ tar@@ s : but ye have not obe@@ yed my voice : why have ye done this ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thor@@ ns in your sides , and their go@@ ds shall be a sn@@ are un@@ to you .
and it came to pass , when the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and they called the name of that place Bo@@ c@@ him : and they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there un@@ to the Lord .
and when Jos@@ hua had let the people go , the children of Israel went every man un@@ to his inher@@ it@@ ance to poss@@ ess the land .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ her@@ es , in the mount of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north side of the hill G@@ a@@ ash .
and also all that generation were gathered un@@ to their fa@@ thers : and there ar@@ ose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and served Ba@@ al@@ im :
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for ev@@ il , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn un@@ to them : and they were greatly dist@@ ressed .
nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that sp@@ o@@ iled them .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and he said , Bec@@ ause that this people hat@@ h trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I comman@@ ded their fa@@ thers , and have not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to my voice ;
I also will not hen@@ ce@@ forth drive out any from before them of the nations which Jos@@ hua left when he died :
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk there@@ in , as their fa@@ thers did keep it , or not .
therefore the Lord left those nations , without driving them out has@@ ti@@ ly ; neither delivered he them into the hand of Jos@@ hua .
name@@ ly , five lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes that d@@ wel@@ t in mount Lebanon , from mount Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ her@@ mon un@@ to the entering in of Ham@@ ath .
and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , H@@ itti@@ tes , and Am@@ ori@@ tes , and Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and Je@@ bu@@ sites :
and they took their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to be their wi@@ ves , and gave their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to their sons , and served their go@@ ds .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and for@@ g@@ at the Lord their God , and served Ba@@ al@@ im and the gro@@ ves .
therefore the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia : and the children of Israel served Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim eight years .
and when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon him , and he jud@@ ged Israel , and went out to war : and the Lord delivered Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia into his hand ; and his hand prev@@ ailed against Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and he gathered un@@ to him the children of Am@@ mon and A@@ mal@@ ek , and went and smo@@ te Israel , and poss@@ essed the city of pal@@ m trees .
but E@@ h@@ ud made him a da@@ g@@ ger which had two ed@@ ges , of a cu@@ bit length ; and he did gir@@ d it under his ra@@ im@@ ent upon his right th@@ igh .
and he brought the present un@@ to Eg@@ lon king of Mo@@ a@@ b : and Eg@@ lon was a very f@@ at man .
and when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that b@@ are the present .
and E@@ h@@ ud came un@@ to him ; and he was sitting in a summer par@@ l@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and E@@ h@@ ud said , I have a message from God un@@ to the@@ e . and he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and E@@ h@@ ud put forth his left hand , and took the da@@ g@@ ger from his right th@@ igh , and th@@ rust it into his bel@@ ly :
and the haf@@ t also went in after the bla@@ de ; and the f@@ at closed upon the bla@@ de , so that he could not draw the da@@ g@@ ger out of his bel@@ ly ; and the dir@@ t came out .
then E@@ h@@ ud went forth through the por@@ ch , and shut the doors of the par@@ l@@ our upon him , and locked them .
and E@@ h@@ ud escaped while they tar@@ ried , and passed beyond the qu@@ arri@@ es , and escaped un@@ to Se@@ ir@@ ath .
and they sle@@ w of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , all lu@@ st@@ y , and all men of val@@ our ; and there escaped not a man .
so Mo@@ a@@ b was sub@@ du@@ ed that day under the hand of Israel . and the land had rest fo@@ ur@@ score years .
and the children of Israel again did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , when E@@ h@@ ud was dead .
and the Lord sold them into the hand of J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an , that re@@ ig@@ ned in Haz@@ or ; the captain of whose host was Sis@@ era , which d@@ wel@@ t in Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
and the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord : for he had nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron ; and twenty years he m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly op@@ pressed the children of Israel .
and De@@ bor@@ ah , a pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of Lap@@ i@@ do@@ th , she jud@@ ged Israel at that time .
and she d@@ wel@@ t under the pal@@ m tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
and I will draw un@@ to the@@ e to the river K@@ ish@@ on Sis@@ era , the captain of J@@ ab@@ in 's army , with his char@@ i@@ ots and his multi@@ tude ; and I will deliver him into th@@ ine hand .
and B@@ arak called Ze@@ bul@@ un and Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i to K@@ ede@@ sh ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet : and De@@ bor@@ ah went up with him .
and they she@@ wed Sis@@ era that B@@ arak the son of A@@ bin@@ o@@ am was gone up to mount T@@ ab@@ or .
and Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les un@@ to the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted Sis@@ era , and all his char@@ i@@ ots , and all his host , with the edge of the s@@ word before B@@ arak ; so that Sis@@ era ligh@@ ted down off his char@@ i@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the host , un@@ to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the host of Sis@@ era fell upon the edge of the s@@ word ; and there was not a man left .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and he said un@@ to her , Gi@@ ve me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a little water to drink ; for I am thir@@ st@@ y . and she opened a bot@@ tle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
and the hand of the children of Israel prosp@@ ered , and prev@@ ailed against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
hear , O ye kings ; give e@@ ar , O ye pr@@ inces ; I , even I , will sing un@@ to the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
Lord , when th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test out of Se@@ ir , when th@@ ou mar@@ ch@@ ed@@ st out of the field of E@@ dom , the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and the heav@@ ens dropped , the cl@@ ou@@ ds also dropped water .
the mountains mel@@ ted from before the Lord , even that S@@ ina@@ i from before the Lord God of Israel .
in the days of Sh@@ am@@ gar the son of An@@ ath , in the days of Ja@@ el , the highways were un@@ occupied , and the travellers walked through by@@ ways .
my heart is toward the govern@@ ors of Israel , that offered themselves will@@ ingly among the people . b@@ less ye the Lord .

aw@@ ake , aw@@ ake , De@@ bor@@ ah : aw@@ ake , aw@@ ake , ut@@ ter a song : arise , B@@ arak , and lead TH@@ Y cap@@ tivity cap@@ tive , th@@ ou son of A@@ bin@@ o@@ am .
then he made him that remain@@ eth have domin@@ ion over the no@@ bles among the people : the Lord made me have domin@@ ion over the m@@ igh@@ ty .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after the@@ e , Benjamin , among TH@@ Y people ; out of Mac@@ hir came down govern@@ ors , and out of Ze@@ bul@@ un they that handle the p@@ en of the writer .
and the pr@@ inces of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah ; even Is@@ sac@@ har , and also B@@ arak : he was sent on fo@@ ot into the val@@ ley . for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great th@@ ou@@ ghts of heart .
why abo@@ dest th@@ ou among the she@@ ep@@ fol@@ ds , to hear the ble@@ atings of the f@@ loc@@ ks ? for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great sear@@ ch@@ ings of heart .
Ze@@ bul@@ un and Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i were a people that jeop@@ ar@@ ded their lives un@@ to the death in the high places of the field .
the river of K@@ ish@@ on swe@@ pt them away , that ancient river , the river K@@ ish@@ on . O my sou@@ l , th@@ ou h@@ ast tro@@ dden down strength .
then were the hor@@ se@@ ho@@ of@@ s broken by the means of the pr@@ ans@@ ings , the pr@@ ans@@ ings of their m@@ igh@@ ty ones .
b@@ les@@ sed above women shall Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite be , b@@ les@@ sed shall she be above women in the tent .
she put her hand to the na@@ il , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer ; and with the ham@@ mer she smo@@ te Sis@@ era , she smo@@ te off his head , when she had pi@@ er@@ ced and stric@@ ken through his temp@@ les .
at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell : where he bo@@ wed , there he fell down dead .
the mother of Sis@@ era looked out at a window , and cri@@ ed through the lat@@ tice , Wh@@ y is his char@@ i@@ ot so long in coming ? why tar@@ ry the whe@@ els of his char@@ i@@ ots ?
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Mi@@ dian seven years .
and the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel : and because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and c@@ aves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and Israel was greatly imp@@ over@@ ished because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ; and the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ,
that the Lord sent a pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to the children of Israel , which said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all that op@@ pressed you , and dra@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said un@@ to you , I am the Lord your God ; fear not the go@@ ds of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in whose land ye d@@ well : but ye have not obe@@ yed my voice .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord appeared un@@ to him , and said un@@ to him , The Lord is with the@@ e , th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ our .
and the Lord looked upon him , and said , G@@ o in this TH@@ Y might , and th@@ ou s@@ halt save Israel from the hand of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites : have not I sent the@@ e ?
and he said un@@ to him , If now I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , then she@@ w me a sign that th@@ ou talk@@ est with me .
de@@ part not hence , I pra@@ y the@@ e , until I come un@@ to the@@ e , and bring forth my present , and set it before the@@ e . and he said , I will tar@@ ry until th@@ ou come again .
and when G@@ ide@@ on perceived that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord , G@@ ide@@ on said , A@@ las , O Lord God ! for because I have seen an an@@ gel of the Lord face to face .
and build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which th@@ ou s@@ halt cut down .
and they said one to another , Wh@@ o hat@@ h done this thing ? and when they inqu@@ ired and asked , they said , G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash hat@@ h done this thing .
then all the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of J@@ ez@@ reel .
but the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon G@@ ide@@ on , and he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et ; and A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ er was gathered after him .
and it was so : for he rose up early on the mor@@ row , and th@@ rust the F@@ le@@ ece together , and wr@@ ing@@ ed the dew out of the F@@ le@@ ece , a bo@@ w@@ l full of water .
and God did so that night : for it was d@@ ry upon the F@@ le@@ ece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
and the Lord said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , The people that are with the@@ e are too many for me to give the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into their hands , lest Israel va@@ un@@ t themselves against me , saying , M@@ ine own hand hat@@ h sav@@ ed me .
and the number of them that la@@ pped , putting their hand to their m@@ outh , were three hundred men : but all the rest of the people bo@@ wed down upon their k@@ ne@@ es to drink water .
and it came to pass the same night , that the Lord said un@@ to him , arise , get the@@ e down un@@ to the host ; for I have delivered it into th@@ ine hand .
but if th@@ ou fear to go down , go th@@ ou with P@@ hur@@ ah TH@@ Y ser@@ vant down to the host :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt hear what they say ; and after@@ ward shall th@@ ine hands be strengthened to go down un@@ to the host . then went he down with P@@ hur@@ ah his ser@@ vant un@@ to the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and by the sea side for multi@@ tude .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a tr@@ ump@@ et in every man 's hand , with empty pit@@ chers , and lam@@ ps within the pit@@ chers .
when I blow with a tr@@ ump@@ et , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the tr@@ ump@@ ets also on every side of all the camp , and say , The s@@ word of the Lord , and of G@@ ide@@ on .
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp : and all the host ran , and cri@@ ed , and fled .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and G@@ ide@@ on came to Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , fa@@ int , yet pursuing them .
and the pr@@ inces of Suc@@ co@@ th said , Ar@@ e the hands of Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na now in th@@ ine hand , that we should give bread un@@ to th@@ ine army ?
and he went up th@@ ence to Pen@@ uel , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them likewise : and the men of Pen@@ uel answ@@ ered him as the men of Suc@@ co@@ th had answ@@ ered him .
and he sp@@ ake also un@@ to the men of Pen@@ uel , saying , When I come again in peace , I will break down this to@@ wer .
and G@@ ide@@ on went up by the way of them that d@@ wel@@ t in ten@@ ts on the east of N@@ ob@@ ah and Jo@@ g@@ beha@@ h , and smo@@ te the host : for the host was secure .
and when Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na fled , he pursu@@ ed after them , and took the two kings of Mi@@ dian , Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na , and dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted all the host .
and caught a young man of the men of Suc@@ co@@ th , and inqu@@ ired of him : and he described un@@ to him the pr@@ inces of Suc@@ co@@ th , and the el@@ ders there@@ of , even thre@@ es@@ core and se@@ ven@@ teen men .
and he took the el@@ ders of the city , and thor@@ ns of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and bri@@ ers , and with them he ta@@ ught the men of Suc@@ co@@ th .
and he beat down the to@@ wer of Pen@@ uel , and sle@@ w the men of the city .
then the men of Israel said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , R@@ ule th@@ ou over us , both th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y son 's son also : for th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered us from the hand of Mi@@ dian .
thus was Mi@@ dian sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and G@@ ide@@ on had thre@@ es@@ core and ten sons of his body be@@ gotten : for he had many wi@@ ves .
and G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h of the A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ ri@@ tes .
and it came to pass , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a wh@@ oring after Ba@@ al@@ im , and made Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
and the children of Israel remember@@ ed not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enem@@ ies on every side :
neither she@@ wed they kin@@ d@@ ness to the house of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , name@@ ly , G@@ ide@@ on , according to all the Go@@ od@@ ness which he had she@@ wed un@@ to Israel .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem un@@ to his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and they gave him thre@@ es@@ core and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith , where@@ with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch hired v@@ ain and light persons , which followed him .
and all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem gathered together , and all the house of Mil@@ lo , and went , and made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , by the pla@@ in of the pil@@ lar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
the trees went forth on a time to ano@@ int a king over them ; and they said un@@ to the olive tree , reign th@@ ou over us .
but the olive tree said un@@ to them , Sho@@ uld I leave my fat@@ ness , where@@ with by me they honour God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and the v@@ ine said un@@ to them , Sho@@ uld I leave my wine , which che@@ er@@ eth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely , in that ye have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , and if ye have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done un@@ to him according to the de@@ serving of his hands ;
( for my father fought for you , and adv@@ ent@@ ured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Mi@@ dian :
if ye then have dealt truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and with his house this day , then re@@ jo@@ ice ye in A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and let him also re@@ jo@@ ice in you :
and Jo@@ th@@ am ran away , and fled , and went to Be@@ er , and d@@ wel@@ t there , for fear of A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch his brother .
then God sent an ev@@ il spirit between A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch :
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his bre@@ th@@ ren , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem : and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their confidence in him .
and would to God this people were under my hand ! then would I remove A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch . and he said to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , In@@ cre@@ ase th@@ ine army , and come out .
and when Ze@@ bul the ru@@ ler of the city heard the words of G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed , his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led .
and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch priv@@ ily , saying , be@@ hold , G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his bre@@ th@@ ren be come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and , be@@ hold , they for@@ ti@@ fy the city against the@@ e .
now therefore up by night , th@@ ou and the people that is with the@@ e , and lie in wait in the field :
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ch@@ ased him , and he fled before him , and many were over@@ thrown and wounded , even un@@ to the entering of the gate .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch d@@ wel@@ t at Ar@@ um@@ ah : and Ze@@ bul th@@ rust out G@@ a@@ al and his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they should not d@@ well in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that the people went out into the field ; and they told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and sle@@ w the people that was there@@ in , and beat down the city , and so@@ wed it with salt .
and when all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the go@@ d Ber@@ ith .
and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , that all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem were gathered together .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and th@@ ither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and g@@ at them up to the top of the to@@ wer .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came un@@ to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and went hard un@@ to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
and a certain woman cast a piece of a mil@@ l@@ stone upon A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's head , and all to br@@ ake his s@@ kul@@ l .
and when the men of Israel saw that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch was dead , they depar@@ ted every man un@@ to his place .
thus God ren@@ dered the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , which he did un@@ to his father , in s@@ lay@@ ing his sev@@ enty bre@@ th@@ ren :
and all the ev@@ il of the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem did God ren@@ der upon their heads : and upon them came the cur@@ se of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al .
and after A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch there ar@@ ose to defend Israel Tola the son of Pu@@ ah , the son of Do@@ do , a man of Is@@ sac@@ har ; and he d@@ wel@@ t in Sh@@ amir in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and he jud@@ ged Israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in Sh@@ amir .
and he had thirty sons that ro@@ de on thirty ass col@@ ts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Hav@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ j@@ air un@@ to this day , which are in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hands of the children of Am@@ mon .
moreover the children of Am@@ mon passed over Jordan to fight also against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was sor@@ e dist@@ ressed .
and the Lord said un@@ to the children of Israel , did not I deliver you from the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and from the Am@@ ori@@ tes , from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians also , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the Ma@@ on@@ ites , did op@@ press you ; and ye cri@@ ed to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
go and cry un@@ to the go@@ ds which ye have chosen ; let them deliver you in the time of your tri@@ bu@@ lation .
and the children of Israel said un@@ to the Lord , We have sin@@ ned : do th@@ ou un@@ to us wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to the@@ e ; deliver us only , we pra@@ y the@@ e , this day .
and they put away the st@@ range go@@ ds from among them , and served the Lord : and his sou@@ l was gri@@ ev@@ ed for the mis@@ ery of Israel .
then the children of Am@@ mon were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . and the children of Israel assemb@@ led themselves together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and the people and pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said one to another , What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
now J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ our , and he was the son of an har@@ lot : and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad beg@@ at J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain men to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel .
and it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to f@@ et@@ ch J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b :
and they said un@@ to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , C@@ ome , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Am@@ mon .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah said un@@ to the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , did not ye h@@ ate me , and exp@@ el me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come un@@ to me now when ye are in dist@@ ress ?
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah said un@@ to the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and the Lord deliver them before me , shall I be your head ?
and the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said un@@ to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , The Lord be witness between us , if we do not so according to TH@@ Y words .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah went with the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and the people made him head and captain over them : and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah ut@@ tered all his words before the Lord in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , What h@@ ast th@@ ou to do with me , that th@@ ou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again un@@ to the king of the children of Am@@ mon :
and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , Israel took not away the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , nor the land of the children of Am@@ mon :
but when Israel came up from Egypt , and walked through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness un@@ to the Red sea , and came to K@@ ade@@ sh ;
and Israel sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon ; and Israel said un@@ to him , Let us pass , we pra@@ y the@@ e , through TH@@ Y land into my place .
but S@@ ih@@ on tr@@ usted not Israel to pass through his coast : but S@@ ih@@ on gathered all his people together , and pit@@ ched in Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and they poss@@ essed all the co@@ asts of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , from Ar@@ non even un@@ to J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , and from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness even un@@ to Jordan .
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou poss@@ ess that which Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h TH@@ Y go@@ d gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess ? so wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we poss@@ ess .
and now art th@@ ou any thing better than Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por , king of Mo@@ a@@ b ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I have not sin@@ ned against the@@ e , but th@@ ou do@@ est me wrong to war against me : the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Am@@ mon .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the king of the children of Am@@ mon hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the words of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah which he sent him .
then the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah vowed a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and said , If th@@ ou s@@ halt without fail deliver the children of Am@@ mon into mine hands ,
so J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah passed over un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon to fight against them ; and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah came to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h un@@ to his house , and , be@@ hold , his daughter came out to meet him with tim@@ bre@@ ls and with dan@@ ces : and she was his only child ; bes@@ ide her he had neither son nor daughter .
and she said un@@ to her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my fel@@ lows .
and he said , G@@ o . and he sent her away for two months : and she went with her compan@@ ions , and be@@ w@@ ailed her vir@@ gin@@ ity upon the mountains .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah said un@@ to them , I and my people were at great stri@@ fe with the children of Am@@ mon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah jud@@ ged Israel six years . then died J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was buried in one of the cities of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and he had thirty sons , and thirty da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom he sent abroad , and took in thirty da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters from abroad for his sons . and he jud@@ ged Israel seven years .
and El@@ on the Ze@@ bul@@ on@@ ite died , and was buried in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on in the country of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
and he had for@@ ty sons and thirty ne@@ phe@@ ws , that ro@@ de on thre@@ es@@ core and ten ass col@@ ts : and he jud@@ ged Israel eight years .
and Ab@@ don the son of Hil@@ le@@ l the Pi@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ ite died , and was buried in Pi@@ ra@@ th@@ on in the land of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , in the mount of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines for@@ ty years .
and there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dani@@ tes , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and b@@ are not .
and God hear@@ ken@@ ed to the voice of Man@@ o@@ ah ; and the an@@ gel of God came again un@@ to the woman as she sat in the field : but Man@@ o@@ ah her husband was not with her .
she may not eat of any thing that co@@ me@@ th of the v@@ ine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing : all that I comman@@ ded her let her observe .
and Man@@ o@@ ah said un@@ to the an@@ gel of the Lord , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let us de@@ tain the@@ e , until we shall have made ready a k@@ id for the@@ e .
so Man@@ o@@ ah took a k@@ id with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock un@@ to the Lord : and the an@@ gel did won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly ; and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
but the an@@ gel of the Lord did no more appear to Man@@ o@@ ah and to his wife . then Man@@ o@@ ah knew that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord .
and Sam@@ son went down to Tim@@ n@@ ath , and saw a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ath of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ath of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ n@@ ath , and came to the v@@ ine@@ yards of Tim@@ n@@ ath : and , be@@ hold , a young lion ro@@ ar@@ ed against him .
and he went down , and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Sam@@ son well .
so his father went down un@@ to the woman : and Sam@@ son made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty compan@@ ions to be with him .
and her father said , I veril@@ y thought that th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st ut@@ ter@@ ly ha@@ ted her ; therefore I gave her to TH@@ Y compan@@ ion : is not her younger sister fa@@ i@@ rer than she ? take her , I pra@@ y the@@ e , instead of her .
and Sam@@ son said concerning them , Now shall I be more bla@@ me@@ less than the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , though I do them a disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure .
and Sam@@ son went and caught three hundred fo@@ x@@ es , and took fire@@ brands , and turned ta@@ il to ta@@ il , and put a fire@@ brand in the mid@@ st between two ta@@ ils .
and Sam@@ son said un@@ to them , Th@@ ough ye have done this , yet will I be av@@ en@@ ged of you , and after that I will ce@@ ase .
and he smo@@ te them hip and th@@ igh with a great sla@@ ughter : and he went down and d@@ wel@@ t in the top of the rock E@@ tam .
then the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up , and pit@@ ched in Ju@@ da@@ h , and spread themselves in Leh@@ i .
and he found a new j@@ aw@@ bone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and sle@@ w a thousand men there@@ with .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand , and called that place Ram@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ le@@ hi .
and it came to pass after@@ ward , that he lov@@ ed a woman in the val@@ ley of So@@ rek , whose name was Del@@ il@@ ah .
and Sam@@ son said un@@ to her , If they bin@@ d me with seven green with@@ s that were never dri@@ ed , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
then the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought up to her seven green with@@ s which had not been dri@@ ed , and she bound him with them .
and Del@@ il@@ ah said un@@ to Sam@@ son , be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast mo@@ cked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , where@@ with th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test be bound .
and he said un@@ to her , If they bin@@ d me fast with new ro@@ pes that never were occupied , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his sou@@ l was v@@ ex@@ ed un@@ to death ;
but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he did gr@@ ind in the prison house .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the ha@@ ir of his head began to grow again after he was sha@@ ven .
then the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice un@@ to D@@ agon their go@@ d , and to re@@ jo@@ ice : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destro@@ yer of our country , which sle@@ w many of us .
and Sam@@ son said un@@ to the la@@ d that held him by the hand , suffer me that I may feel the pil@@ lars where@@ upon the house stan@@ de@@ th , that I may le@@ an upon them .
and the man Mic@@ ah had an house of go@@ ds , and made an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and consec@@ rated one of his sons , who became his pri@@ est .
in those days there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and there was a young man out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h of the family of Ju@@ da@@ h , who was a Lev@@ ite , and he so@@ jour@@ ned there .
and the man depar@@ ted out of the city from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h to so@@ jour@@ n where he could find a place : and he came to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he jour@@ ne@@ yed .
and Mic@@ ah said un@@ to him , Wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ? and he said un@@ to him , I am a Lev@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h , and I go to so@@ jour@@ n where I may find a place .
and the Lev@@ ite was content to d@@ well with the man ; and the young man was un@@ to him as one of his sons .
and Mic@@ ah consec@@ rated the Lev@@ ite ; and the young man became his pri@@ est , and was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
and they said un@@ to him , As@@ k coun@@ sel , we pra@@ y the@@ e , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the pri@@ est said un@@ to them , G@@ o in peace : before the Lord is your way where@@ in ye go .
when ye go , ye shall come un@@ to a people secure , and to a large land : for God hat@@ h given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the ear@@ th .
and there went from th@@ ence of the family of the Dani@@ tes , out of Zor@@ ah and out of E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war .
and they passed th@@ ence un@@ to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and came un@@ to the house of Mic@@ ah .
and they turned th@@ i@@ ther@@ ward , and came to the house of the young man the Lev@@ ite , even un@@ to the house of Mic@@ ah , and sal@@ uted him .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and the pri@@ est 's heart was glad , and he took the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the Gra@@ ven image , and went in the mid@@ st of the people .
so they turned and depar@@ ted , and put the little ones and the c@@ attle and the carri@@ age before them .
and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the children of Dan . and they turned their faces , and said un@@ to Mic@@ ah , What ail@@ eth the@@ e , that th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st with such a company ?
and he said , Y@@ e have taken away my go@@ ds which I made , and the pri@@ est , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say un@@ to me , What ail@@ eth the@@ e ?
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back un@@ to his house .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born un@@ to Israel : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
and when the man rose up to de@@ part , his father in law urged him : therefore he lo@@ d@@ ged there again .
and he ar@@ ose early in the morning on the fifth day to de@@ part : and the dam@@ sel 's father said , Com@@ for@@ t th@@ ine heart , I pra@@ y the@@ e . and they tar@@ ried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jer@@ usalem ; and there were with him two ass@@ es s@@ add@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to his master , C@@ ome , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and let us turn in into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it .
and his master said un@@ to him , We will not turn aside hi@@ ther into the city of a st@@ ran@@ ger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gi@@ be@@ ah , which belon@@ get@@ h to Benjamin .
and , be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city : and the old man said , W@@ hi@@ ther go@@ est th@@ ou ? and wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ?
so he brought him into his house , and gave pro@@ ven@@ der un@@ to the ass@@ es : and they was@@ hed their feet , and did eat and drink .
then came the woman in the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lor@@ d was , ti@@ ll it was light .
and he said un@@ to her , Up , and let us be going . but none answ@@ ered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and g@@ at him un@@ to his place .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , with the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to the Lord in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot@@ men that drew s@@ word .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h . ) Th@@ en said the children of Israel , T@@ ell us , how was this w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ?
and the Lev@@ ite , the husband of the woman that was sla@@ in , answ@@ ered and said , I came into Gi@@ be@@ ah that belon@@ get@@ h to Benjamin , I and my conc@@ ub@@ ine , to lo@@ dge .
and I took my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inher@@ it@@ ance of Israel : for they have committed le@@ w@@ d@@ ness and Fol@@ ly in Israel .
and all the people ar@@ ose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gi@@ be@@ ah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , k@@ n@@ it together as one man .
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men le@@ f@@ than@@ ded ; every one could s@@ ling stones at an ha@@ ir b@@ read@@ th , and not mis@@ s .
and the men of Israel , bes@@ ide Benjamin , were num@@ ber@@ ed four hundred thousand men that drew s@@ word : all these were men of war .
and the children of Israel rose up in the morning , and en@@ camp@@ ed against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gi@@ be@@ ah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men ; all these drew the s@@ word .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
and there came against Gi@@ be@@ ah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was sor@@ e : but they knew not that ev@@ il was near them .
and the liers in wait has@@ ted , and rushed upon Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smo@@ te all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great fla@@ me with smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the fla@@ me began to arise up out of the city with a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them , and , be@@ hold , the fla@@ me of the city as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en .
and when the men of Israel turned again , the men of Benjamin were amaz@@ ed : for they saw that ev@@ il was come upon them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel un@@ to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle over@@ took them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the mid@@ st of them .
thus they inc@@ los@@ ed the Benj@@ am@@ ites round about , and ch@@ ased them , and tro@@ de them down with ease over against Gi@@ be@@ ah toward the sun@@ rising .
so that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the s@@ word ; all these were men of val@@ our .
but six hundred men turned and fled to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness un@@ to the rock R@@ im@@ mon , and abo@@ de in the rock R@@ im@@ mon four months .
now the men of Israel had sworn in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter un@@ to Benjamin to wife .
and the people came to the house of God , and abo@@ de there ti@@ ll even before God , and lifted up their voices , and we@@ pt sor@@ e ;
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that the people rose early , and built there an alt@@ ar , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings .
and the children of Israel re@@ pen@@ ted them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tri@@ be cut off from Israel this day .
for the people were num@@ ber@@ ed , and , be@@ hold , there were none of the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad there .
and this is the thing that ye shall do , Y@@ e shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy every male , and every woman that hat@@ h la@@ in by man .
and they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them un@@ to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock R@@ im@@ mon , and to call peac@@ e@@ ably un@@ to them .
and the people re@@ pen@@ ted them for Benjamin , because that the Lord had made a breach in the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and they said , There must be an inher@@ it@@ ance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tri@@ be be not destroyed out of Israel .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it we may not give them wi@@ ves of our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cur@@ sed be he that gi@@ vet@@ h a wife to Benjamin .
and the children of Israel depar@@ ted th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch Na@@ om@@ i 's husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
and they took them wi@@ ves of the women of Mo@@ a@@ b ; the name of the one was Or@@ p@@ ah , and the name of the other R@@ ut@@ h : and they d@@ wel@@ led there about ten years .
and Mah@@ lon and Ch@@ il@@ ion died also both of them ; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return un@@ to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Na@@ om@@ i said un@@ to her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law , G@@ o , return each to her mother 's house : the Lord deal kin@@ dly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she k@@ is@@ sed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and Na@@ om@@ i said , Tur@@ n again , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : why will ye go with me ? are there yet any more sons in my w@@ om@@ b , that they may be your hus@@ bands ?
and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt again : and Or@@ p@@ ah k@@ is@@ sed her mother in law ; but R@@ ut@@ h cla@@ ve un@@ to her .
where th@@ ou di@@ est , will I die , and there will I be buried : the Lord do so to me , and more also , if ought but death part the@@ e and me .
when she saw that she was ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly min@@ ded to go with her , then she left speaking un@@ to her .
so they two went until they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . and it came to pass , when they were come to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Na@@ om@@ i ?
so Na@@ om@@ i returned , and R@@ ut@@ h the Mo@@ abi@@ tes@@ s , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : and they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem in the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
and Na@@ om@@ i had a k@@ ins@@ man of her husband 's , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of wealth , of the family of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; and his name was Bo@@ az .
and she went , and came , and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and her ha@@ p was to light on a part of the field belonging un@@ to Bo@@ az , who was of the kin@@ d@@ red of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and be@@ hold , Bo@@ az came from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said un@@ to the re@@ apers , The Lord be with you . and they answ@@ ered him , The Lord b@@ less the@@ e .
and the ser@@ vant that was set over the re@@ apers answ@@ ered and said , It is the Mo@@ abi@@ tish dam@@ sel that came back with Na@@ om@@ i out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b :
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a st@@ ran@@ ger ?
the Lord re@@ compen@@ se TH@@ Y work , and a full reward be given the@@ e of the Lord God of Israel , under whose w@@ ings th@@ ou art come to trust .
and when she was risen up to g@@ le@@ an , Bo@@ az comman@@ ded his young men , saying , Let her g@@ le@@ an even among the s@@ heav@@ es , and re@@ pro@@ ach her not :
and let fall also some of the hand@@ ful@@ s of purpose for her , and leave them , that she may g@@ le@@ an them , and re@@ bu@@ ke her not .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
so she kept fast by the ma@@ i@@ den@@ s of Bo@@ az to g@@ le@@ an un@@ to the end of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est and of wheat har@@ v@@ est ; and d@@ wel@@ t with her mother in law .
and she went down un@@ to the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law b@@ ade her .
and it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , be@@ hold , a woman lay at his feet .
and now it is true that I am TH@@ Y near k@@ ins@@ man : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it there is a k@@ ins@@ man near@@ er than I@@ .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Wh@@ o art th@@ ou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
then said she , sit still , my daughter , until th@@ ou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
and he said un@@ to the k@@ ins@@ man , Na@@ om@@ i , that is come again out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , sel@@ le@@ th a par@@ cel of land , which was our brother Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's :
and let TH@@ Y house be like the house of P@@ har@@ ez , whom Tam@@ ar b@@ are un@@ to Ju@@ da@@ h , of the se@@ ed which the Lord shall give the@@ e of this young woman .
so Bo@@ az took R@@ ut@@ h , and she was his wife : and when he went in un@@ to her , the Lord gave her concep@@ tion , and she b@@ are a son .
and he shall be un@@ to the@@ e a re@@ sto@@ rer of TH@@ Y life , and a no@@ ur@@ is@@ her of th@@ ine old age : for TH@@ Y daughter in law , which lov@@ eth the@@ e , which is better to the@@ e than seven sons , hat@@ h born him .
and Na@@ om@@ i took the child , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and became nur@@ se un@@ to it .
and Ob@@ ed beg@@ at J@@ es@@ se , and J@@ es@@ se beg@@ at David .
and he had two wi@@ ves ; the name of the one was H@@ ann@@ ah , and the name of the other Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah : and Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah had children , but H@@ ann@@ ah had no children .
and when the time was that El@@ kan@@ ah offered , he gave to Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah his wife , and to all her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , por@@ tions :
but un@@ to H@@ ann@@ ah he gave a wor@@ thy portion ; for he lov@@ ed H@@ ann@@ ah : but the Lord had shut up her w@@ om@@ b .
and her ad@@ versary also provoked her sor@@ e , for to make her fre@@ t , because the Lord had shut up her w@@ om@@ b .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and did not eat .
so H@@ ann@@ ah rose up after they had e@@ aten in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and after they had dr@@ un@@ k . now E@@ li the pri@@ est sat upon a seat by a post of the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and she was in bit@@ ter@@ ness of sou@@ l , and pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and we@@ pt sor@@ e .
and it came to pass , as she continued pray@@ ing before the Lord , that E@@ li marked her m@@ outh .
now H@@ ann@@ ah , she sp@@ ake in her heart ; only her li@@ ps moved , but her voice was not heard : therefore E@@ li thought she had been dr@@ un@@ ken .
count not th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id for a daughter of Bel@@ ial : for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of my complaint and gri@@ ef have I spoken hi@@ ther@@ to .
and she said , Let th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id find grace in TH@@ Y sight . so the woman went her way , and did eat , and her coun@@ tenance was no more sad .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it came to pass , when the time was come about after H@@ ann@@ ah had conce@@ ived , that she b@@ are a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Bec@@ ause I have asked him of the Lord .
and the man El@@ kan@@ ah , and all his house , went up to offer un@@ to the Lord the ye@@ arly sacrifice , and his vo@@ w .
and they sle@@ w a bul@@ lock , and brought the child to E@@ li .
and she said , O@@ h my lor@@ d , as TH@@ Y sou@@ l li@@ vet@@ h , my lor@@ d , I am the woman that stood by the@@ e here , pray@@ ing un@@ to the Lord .
for this child I pray@@ ed ; and the Lord hat@@ h given me my petition which I asked of him :
talk no more so exceeding pro@@ u@@ dly ; let not ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy come out of your m@@ outh : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
the bo@@ ws of the m@@ igh@@ ty men are broken , and they that stumb@@ led are gir@@ ded with strength .
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hun@@ gry ce@@ ased : so that the bar@@ ren hat@@ h born seven ; and she that hat@@ h many children is wa@@ xed fe@@ e@@ ble .
the Lord kil@@ le@@ th , and mak@@ eth alive : he br@@ ing@@ eth down to the grave , and br@@ ing@@ eth up .
he will keep the feet of his sa@@ ints , and the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be silent in d@@ ark@@ ness ; for by strength shall no man prev@@ ail .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord : for men ab@@ hor@@ red the offering of the Lord .
moreover his mother made him a little co@@ at , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the ye@@ arly sacrifice .
and the Lord visited H@@ ann@@ ah , so that she conce@@ ived , and b@@ are three sons and two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . and the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
now E@@ li was very old , and heard all that his sons did un@@ to all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
N@@ ay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the Lord 's people to trans@@ gress .
and the child Samuel grew on , and was in favour both with the Lord , and also with men .
and there came a man of God un@@ to E@@ li , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , did I pla@@ in@@ ly appear un@@ to the house of TH@@ Y father , when they were in Egypt in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ?
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of TH@@ Y father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt see an enemy in my habi@@ tation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house for ever .
and this shall be a sign un@@ to the@@ e , that shall come upon TH@@ Y two sons , on H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and the child Samuel minist@@ ered un@@ to the Lord before E@@ li . and the word of the Lord was pre@@ ci@@ ous in those days ; there was no open vision .
and it came to pass at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wa@@ x dim , that he could not see ;
and ER@@ E the lam@@ p of God went out in the temp@@ le of the Lord , where the Ar@@ k of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sle@@ ep ;
now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed un@@ to him .
and the Lord called Samuel again the third time . and he ar@@ ose and went to E@@ li , and said , H@@ ere am I ; for th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st call me . and E@@ li perceived that the Lord had called the child .
and the Lord said to Samuel , be@@ hold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the e@@ ars of every one that he@@ aret@@ h it shall t@@ ing@@ le .
in that day I will perform against E@@ li all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity which he know@@ eth ; because his sons made themselves v@@ ile , and he re@@ strained them not .
and Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . and Samuel fear@@ ed to she@@ w E@@ li the vision .
and Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him , and did let none of his words fall to the ground .
and all Israel from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba knew that Samuel was established to be a pro@@ phe@@ t of the Lord .
and the Lord appeared again in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h : for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h by the word of the Lord .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was s@@ mit@@ ten before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they sle@@ w of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and when the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel sh@@ ou@@ ted with a great sh@@ out , so that the ear@@ th ran@@ g again .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were afraid , for they said , God is come into the camp . and they said , Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! for there hat@@ h not been such a thing her@@ et@@ o@@ fore .
Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these m@@ igh@@ ty go@@ ds ? these are the go@@ ds that smo@@ te the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans with all the plagu@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought , and Israel was s@@ mit@@ ten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great sla@@ ughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot@@ men .
and the Ar@@ k of God was taken ; and the two sons of E@@ li , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , were sla@@ in .
and there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h the same day with his clo@@ th@@ es rent , and with ear@@ th upon his head .
and when E@@ li heard the no@@ ise of the cr@@ ying , he said , What mean@@ eth the no@@ ise of this t@@ um@@ ult ? and the man came in has@@ ti@@ ly , and told E@@ li .
now E@@ li was n@@ in@@ ety and eight years old ; and his eyes were dim , that he could not see .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said un@@ to her , Fe@@ ar not ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast born a son . but she answ@@ ered not , neither did she regard it .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took the Ar@@ k of God , they brought it into the house of D@@ agon , and set it by D@@ agon .
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the mor@@ row , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the ear@@ th before the Ar@@ k of the Lord . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the pri@@ ests of D@@ agon , nor any that come into D@@ agon 's house , tre@@ ad on the threshold of D@@ agon in Ash@@ do@@ d un@@ to this day .
and when the men of Ash@@ do@@ d saw that it was so , they said , The Ar@@ k of the God of Israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sor@@ e upon us , and upon D@@ agon our go@@ d .
and the men that died not were s@@ mit@@ ten with the emer@@ ods : and the cry of the city went up to heav@@ en .
and the Ar@@ k of the Lord was in the country of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven months .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the pri@@ ests and the di@@ vin@@ ers , saying , What shall we do to the Ar@@ k of the Lord ? tell us where@@ with we shall send it to his place .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then do ye har@@ den your hear@@ ts , as the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and P@@ har@@ o@@ ah har@@ dened their hear@@ ts ? when he had w@@ rought won@@ der@@ fully among them , did they not let the people go , and they depar@@ ted ?
now therefore make a new c@@ art , and take two mil@@ ch k@@ ine , on which there hat@@ h come no yok@@ e , and tie the k@@ ine to the c@@ art , and bring their cal@@ ves home from them :
and the men did so ; and took two mil@@ ch k@@ ine , and tied them to the c@@ art , and shut up their cal@@ ves at home :
and they laid the Ar@@ k of the Lord upon the c@@ art , and the co@@ ffer with the m@@ ice of gold and the images of their emer@@ ods .
and they of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
and when the five lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had seen it , they returned to E@@ kr@@ on the same day .
and these are the golden emer@@ ods which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord ; for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for As@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
and the men of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , ce@@ ase not to cry un@@ to the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Samuel took a suc@@ king lam@@ b , and offered it for a bur@@ n@@ t offering wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ to the Lord : and Samuel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord for Israel ; and the Lord heard him .
and the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and smo@@ te them , until they came under Beth @@@ -@@ @ car .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were sub@@ du@@ ed , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
and he went from year to year in cir@@ cu@@ it to Be@@ the@@ l , and G@@ ilg@@ al , and M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and jud@@ ged Israel in all those places .
and his return was to Ram@@ ah ; for there was his house ; and there he jud@@ ged Israel ; and there he built an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his fir@@ st@@ born was Jo@@ el ; and the name of his second , A@@ bi@@ ah : they were judges in Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and the Lord said un@@ to Samuel , Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of the people in all that they say un@@ to the@@ e : for they have not rejected the@@ e , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
now therefore he@@ arken un@@ to their voice : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it yet protest so@@ lem@@ n@@ ly un@@ to them , and she@@ w them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the Lord un@@ to the people that asked of him a king .
and he will take your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to be conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ aries , and to be co@@ oks , and to be Bak@@ ers .
and he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your ol@@ i@@ ve@@ yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
and he will take the tenth of your se@@ ed , and of your v@@ ine@@ yards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your men@@ servants , and your ma@@ id@@ servants , and your good@@ li@@ est young men , and your ass@@ es , and put them to his work .
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our batt@@ les .
and Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he re@@ hear@@ sed them in the e@@ ars of the Lord .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of B@@ ech@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of power .
and the ass@@ es of K@@ ish Sa@@ ul 's father were lost . and K@@ ish said to Sa@@ ul his son , T@@ ake now one of the servants with the@@ e , and arise , go seek the ass@@ es .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant that was with him , C@@ ome , and let us return ; lest my father leave car@@ ing for the ass@@ es , and take thought for us .
( Be@@ fore@@ time in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he sp@@ ake , C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er : for he that is now called a Pro@@ phe@@ t was be@@ fore@@ time called a Se@@ er . )
then said Sa@@ ul to his ser@@ vant , Wel@@ l said ; come , let us go . so they went un@@ to the city where the man of God was .
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young ma@@ i@@ den@@ s going out to draw water , and said un@@ to them , Is the se@@ er here ?
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
now the Lord had told Samuel in his e@@ ar a day before Sa@@ ul came , saying ,
then Sa@@ ul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , T@@ ell me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , where the se@@ er 's house is .
and Samuel took Sa@@ ul and his ser@@ vant , and brought them into the par@@ l@@ our , and made them sit in the chi@@ ef@@ est place among them that were bid@@ den , which were about thirty persons .
and Samuel said un@@ to the co@@ ok , Br@@ ing the portion which I gave the@@ e , of which I said un@@ to the@@ e , S@@ et it by the@@ e .
and when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel commun@@ ed with Sa@@ ul upon the top of the house .
and they will sal@@ ute the@@ e , and give the@@ e two lo@@ aves of bread ; which th@@ ou s@@ halt receive of their hands .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord will come upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with them , and s@@ halt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come un@@ to the@@ e , that th@@ ou do as occasion serve the@@ e ; for God is with the@@ e .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
and when they came th@@ ither to the hill , be@@ hold , a company of pro@@ ph@@ ets met him ; and the Spiri@@ t of God came upon him , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied among them .
and when he had made an end of pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying , he came to the high place .
and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to his un@@ cle , He told us pla@@ in@@ ly that the ass@@ es were found . but of the matter of the k@@ ing@@ dom , where@@ of Samuel sp@@ ake , he told him not .
and when Samuel had caused all the tri@@ bes of Israel to come near , the tri@@ be of Benjamin was taken .
when he had caused the tri@@ be of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Mat@@ ri was taken , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
and they ran and f@@ et@@ ched him th@@ ence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and Sa@@ ul also went home to Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hear@@ ts God had touched .
then N@@ ah@@ ash the Am@@ mon@@ ite came up , and en@@ camp@@ ed against J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad : and all the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h said un@@ to N@@ ah@@ ash , Mak@@ e a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with us , and we will serve the@@ e .
then came the mes@@ sen@@ gers to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and told the ti@@ dings in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and we@@ pt .
and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul came after the her@@ d out of the field ; and Sa@@ ul said , What ail@@ eth the people that they we@@ ep ? and they told him the ti@@ dings of the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h .
and when he num@@ ber@@ ed them in B@@ ez@@ ek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h thirty thousand .
therefore the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h said , To mor@@ row we will come out un@@ to you , and ye shall do with us all that se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to you .
and Samuel said un@@ to all Israel , be@@ hold , I have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to your voice in all that ye said un@@ to me , and have made a king over you .
and he said un@@ to them , The Lord is witness against you , and his ano@@ in@@ ted is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answ@@ ered , He is witness .
and Samuel said un@@ to the people , It is the Lord that advanced Mos@@ es and Aaron , and that brought your fa@@ thers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fa@@ thers .
when Jac@@ o@@ b was come into Egypt , and your fa@@ thers cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , then the Lord sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , which brought forth your fa@@ thers out of Egypt , and made them d@@ well in this place .
and when ye saw that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon came against you , ye said un@@ to me , N@@ ay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the Lord your God was your king .
now therefore be@@ hold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desi@@ red ! and , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h set a king over you .
but if ye will not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
so Samuel called un@@ to the Lord ; and the Lord sent Th@@ under and rain that day : and all the people greatly fear@@ ed the Lord and Samuel .
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after v@@ ain things , which can@@ not profit nor deliver ; for they are v@@ ain .
for the Lord will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hat@@ h pleased the Lord to make you his people .
moreover as for me , God for@@ bid that I should sin against the Lord in ce@@ asing to pra@@ y for you : but I will te@@ ach you the good and the right way :
Sa@@ ul re@@ ig@@ ned one year ; and when he had re@@ ig@@ ned two years over Israel ,
and Jon@@ athan smo@@ te the gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines that was in Ge@@ ba , and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard of it . and Sa@@ ul ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ et throughout all the land , saying , Let the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws hear .
and all Israel heard say that Sa@@ ul had s@@ mit@@ ten a gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and that Israel also was had in ab@@ omin@@ ation with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the people were called together after Sa@@ ul to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and some of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws went over Jordan to the land of G@@ ad and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . as for Sa@@ ul , he was yet in G@@ ilg@@ al , and all the people followed him tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
and he tar@@ ried seven days , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed : but Samuel came not to G@@ ilg@@ al ; and the people were sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might sal@@ ute him .
therefore said I , The Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down now upon me to G@@ ilg@@ al , and I have not made supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the Lord : I forced myself therefore , and offered a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and Samuel said to Sa@@ ul , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord TH@@ Y God , which he comman@@ ded the@@ e : for now would the Lord have established TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever .
and Samuel ar@@ ose , and g@@ at him up from G@@ ilg@@ al un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin . and Sa@@ ul num@@ ber@@ ed the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and Sa@@ ul , and Jon@@ athan his son , and the people that were present with them , abo@@ de in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin : but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ camp@@ ed in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h .
and the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned un@@ to the way that le@@ ade@@ th to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , un@@ to the land of Sh@@ ual :
now there was no S@@ mit@@ h found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , L@@ est the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws make them s@@ words or spe@@ ars :
but all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes went down to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to shar@@ p@@ en every man his share , and his co@@ ul@@ ter , and his ax@@ e , and his mat@@ to@@ ck .
yet they had a file for the mat@@ to@@ cks , and for the co@@ ul@@ ters , and for the for@@ ks , and for the ax@@ es , and to shar@@ p@@ en the go@@ ads .
and Sa@@ ul tar@@ ried in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of Gi@@ be@@ ah under a po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree which is in Mig@@ ron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the one was situ@@ ate nor@@ th@@ ward over against Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , and the other sou@@ th@@ ward over against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and both of them discovered themselves un@@ to the gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , be@@ hold , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws come forth out of the ho@@ les where they had hi@@ d themselves .
and that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half ac@@ re of land , which a yok@@ e of ox@@ en might plo@@ w .
and the watch@@ men of Sa@@ ul in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin looked ; and , be@@ hold , the multi@@ tude mel@@ ted away , and they went on beating down one another .
then said Sa@@ ul un@@ to the people that were with him , N@@ um@@ ber now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had num@@ ber@@ ed , be@@ hold , Jon@@ athan and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er were not there .
and Sa@@ ul and all the people that were with him assemb@@ led themselves , and they came to the battle : and , be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ f@@ it@@ ure .
moreover the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hi@@ d themselves in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
then said Jon@@ athan , My father hat@@ h troubled the land : see , I pra@@ y you , how mine eyes have been en@@ ligh@@ tened , because I tas@@ ted a little of this hon@@ ey .
how much more , if hap@@ ly the people had e@@ aten freely to day of the sp@@ oil of their enem@@ ies which they found ? for had there not been now a much greater sla@@ ughter among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
and the people fle@@ w upon the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and Sa@@ ul built an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord : the same was the first alt@@ ar that he built un@@ to the Lord .
for , as the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , which sav@@ eth Israel , though it be in Jon@@ athan my son , he shall su@@ rely die . but there was not a man among all the people that answ@@ ered him .
and he gathered an host , and smo@@ te the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that sp@@ o@@ iled them .
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am , the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az : and the name of the captain of his host was Ab@@ ner , the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
and K@@ ish was the father of Sa@@ ul ; and N@@ er the father of Ab@@ ner was the son of A@@ bi@@ el .
and there was sor@@ e war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Sa@@ ul : and when Sa@@ ul saw any strong man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him un@@ to him .
Samuel also said un@@ to Sa@@ ul , The Lord sent me to ano@@ int the@@ e to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore he@@ arken th@@ ou un@@ to the voice of the words of the Lord .
and Sa@@ ul came to a city of A@@ mal@@ ek , and laid wait in the val@@ ley .
and Sa@@ ul smo@@ te the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites from Hav@@ il@@ ah until th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Sh@@ ur , that is over against Egypt .
and he took A@@ ga@@ g the king of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites alive , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the people with the edge of the s@@ word .
and Samuel came to Sa@@ ul : and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed be th@@ ou of the Lord : I have performed the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
and Samuel said , When th@@ ou w@@ ast little in th@@ ine own sight , w@@ ast th@@ ou not made the head of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the Lord ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e king over Israel ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , but di@@ d@@ st fly upon the sp@@ oil , and di@@ d@@ st ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord ?
and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to Samuel , Ye@@ a , I have obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord , and have gone the way which the Lord sent me , and have brought A@@ ga@@ g the king of A@@ mal@@ ek , and have ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , par@@ don my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the Lord .
and Samuel said un@@ to Sa@@ ul , I will not return with the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hat@@ h rejected the@@ e from being king over Israel .
and as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the sk@@ ir@@ t of his man@@ tle , and it rent .
and Samuel said un@@ to him , The Lord hat@@ h rent the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel from the@@ e this day , and hat@@ h given it to a neighbour of th@@ ine , that is better than th@@ ou .
then he said , I have sin@@ ned : yet honour me now , I pra@@ y the@@ e , before the el@@ ders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the Lord TH@@ Y God .
and Samuel said , As TH@@ Y s@@ word hat@@ h made women ch@@ ild@@ less , so shall TH@@ Y mother be ch@@ ild@@ less among women . and Samuel he@@ wed A@@ ga@@ g in pieces before the Lord in G@@ ilg@@ al .
then Samuel went to Ram@@ ah ; and Sa@@ ul went up to his house to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul .
then Samuel took the Hor@@ n of oil , and ano@@ in@@ ted him in the mid@@ st of his bre@@ th@@ ren : and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to his servants , Pro@@ vi@@ de me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
and J@@ es@@ se took an ass la@@ den with bread , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and a k@@ id , and sent them by David his son un@@ to Sa@@ ul .
and Sa@@ ul sent to J@@ es@@ se , saying , Let David , I pra@@ y the@@ e , stand before me ; for he hat@@ h found favour in my sight .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Sho@@ cho@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and pit@@ ched between Sho@@ cho@@ h and Az@@ ek@@ ah , in E@@ ph@@ es @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ m@@ im .
and Sa@@ ul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pit@@ ched by the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , and set the battle in array against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a val@@ ley between them .
and he had an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head , and he was armed with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
and he had gre@@ aves of br@@ ass upon his leg@@ s , and a target of br@@ ass between his sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and the staff of his spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am ; and his spe@@ ar 's head weighed six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul .
and the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se went and followed Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next un@@ to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
now Sa@@ ul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , fighting with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
for Israel and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had put the battle in array , army against army .
and David left his carri@@ age in the hand of the keep@@ er of the carri@@ age , and ran into the army , and came and sal@@ uted his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sor@@ e afraid .
and the people answ@@ ered him after this manner , saying , S@@ o shall it be done to the man that kil@@ le@@ th him .
and he turned from him toward another , and sp@@ ake after the same manner : and the people answ@@ ered him again after the former manner .
and when the words were heard which David sp@@ ake , they re@@ hear@@ sed them before Sa@@ ul : and he sent for him .
and Sa@@ ul said to David , T@@ ho@@ u art not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him : for th@@ ou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
TH@@ Y ser@@ vant sle@@ w both the lion and the bear : and this un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Phil@@ ist@@ ine shall be as one of them , seeing he hat@@ h de@@ fied the armies of the living God .
and Sa@@ ul armed David with his arm@@ our , and he put an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head ; also he armed him with a co@@ at of mail .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine came on and drew near un@@ to David ; and the man that b@@ are the shield went before him .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he dis@@ da@@ ined him : for he was but a youth , and ru@@ d@@ dy , and of a fair coun@@ tenance .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said un@@ to David , A@@ m I a do@@ g , that th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to me with st@@ aves ? and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine Cur@@ sed David by his go@@ ds .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said to David , C@@ ome to me , and I will give TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and to the be@@ asts of the field .
and all this assembly shall know that the Lord sav@@ eth not with s@@ word and spe@@ ar : for the battle is the Lord 's , and he will give you into our hands .
and it came to pass , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine ar@@ ose , and came and drew n@@ igh to meet David , that David has@@ ted , and ran toward the army to meet the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
and the children of Israel returned from ch@@ asing after the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and they sp@@ o@@ iled their ten@@ ts .
and as David returned from the sla@@ ughter of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , Ab@@ ner took him , and brought him before Sa@@ ul with the head of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his hand .
and Sa@@ ul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father 's house .
and Sa@@ ul cast the j@@ av@@ elin ; for he said , I will sm@@ ite David even to the wall with it . and David avoided out of his presence twice .
and Sa@@ ul was afraid of David , because the Lord was with him , and was depar@@ ted from Sa@@ ul .
therefore Sa@@ ul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and David beha@@ ved himself wis@@ ely in all his ways ; and the Lord was with him .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore when Sa@@ ul saw that he beha@@ ved himself very wis@@ ely , he was afraid of him .
and David said un@@ to Sa@@ ul , Wh@@ o am I ? and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son in law to the king ?
but it came to pass at the time when Mer@@ a@@ b Sa@@ ul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given un@@ to Adri@@ el the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite to wife .
and the servants of Sa@@ ul told him , saying , On this manner sp@@ ake David .
and when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son in law : and the days were not expired .
and Sa@@ ul saw and knew that the Lord was with David , and that Mic@@ hal Sa@@ ul 's daughter lov@@ ed him .
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Jon@@ athan called David , and Jon@@ athan she@@ wed him all those things . and Jon@@ athan brought David to Sa@@ ul , and he was in his presence , as in times past .
and there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sle@@ w them with a great sla@@ ughter ; and they fled from him .
and the ev@@ il spirit from the Lord was upon Sa@@ ul , as he sat in his house with his j@@ av@@ elin in his hand : and David played with his hand .
and Sa@@ ul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the j@@ av@@ elin ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the j@@ av@@ elin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
so Mic@@ hal let David down through a window : and he went , and fled , and escaped .
and Mic@@ hal took an image , and laid it in the bed , and put a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for his bolster , and covered it with a clo@@ th .
and Sa@@ ul sent the mes@@ sen@@ gers again to see David , saying , Br@@ ing him up to me in the bed , that I may s@@ lay him .
and when the mes@@ sen@@ gers were come in , be@@ hold , there was an image in the bed , with a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for his bolster .
so David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ram@@ ah , and told him all that Sa@@ ul had done to him . and he and Samuel went and d@@ wel@@ t in N@@ ai@@ o@@ th .
and it was told Sa@@ ul , saying , be@@ hold , David is at N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
and when it was told Sa@@ ul , he sent other mes@@ sen@@ gers , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied likewise . and Sa@@ ul sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again the third time , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied also .
and he went th@@ ither to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah : and the Spiri@@ t of God was upon him also , and he went on , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , until he came to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
if TH@@ Y father at all mis@@ s me , then say , David ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly asked leave of me that he might run to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem his city : for there is a ye@@ arly sacrifice there for all the family .
if he say thus , It is well ; TH@@ Y ser@@ vant shall have peace : but if he be very wro@@ th , then be sure that ev@@ il is determined by him .
and Jon@@ athan said , F@@ ar be it from the@@ e : for if I knew certainly that ev@@ il were determined by my father to come upon the@@ e , then would not I tell it the@@ e ?
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not only while yet I live she@@ w me the kin@@ d@@ ness of the Lord , that I die not :
but also th@@ ou s@@ halt not cut off TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hat@@ h cut off the enem@@ ies of David every one from the face of the ear@@ th .
so Jon@@ athan made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of David , saying , Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David 's enem@@ ies .
and Jon@@ athan caused David to swe@@ ar again , because he lov@@ ed him : for he lov@@ ed him as he lov@@ ed his own sou@@ l .
and when th@@ ou h@@ ast stayed three days , then th@@ ou s@@ halt go down quickly , and come to the place where th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st hide th@@ y@@ self when the business was in hand , and s@@ halt remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
and I will sho@@ ot three ar@@ ro@@ ws on the side there@@ of , as though I shot at a mark .
but if I say thus un@@ to the young man , be@@ hold , the ar@@ ro@@ ws are beyond the@@ e ; go TH@@ Y way : for the Lord hat@@ h sent the@@ e away .
and as tou@@ ching the matter which th@@ ou and I have spoken of , be@@ hold , the Lord be between the@@ e and me for ever .
so David hi@@ d himself in the field : and when the new moon was come , the king sat him down to eat meat .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of J@@ es@@ se li@@ vet@@ h upon the ground , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be established , nor TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom . W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now send and f@@ et@@ ch him un@@ to me , for he shall su@@ rely die .
and Sa@@ ul cast a j@@ av@@ elin at him to sm@@ ite him : where@@ by Jon@@ athan knew that it was determined of his father to s@@ lay David .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little la@@ d with him .
and he said un@@ to his la@@ d , R@@ un , find out now the ar@@ ro@@ ws which I sho@@ ot . and as the la@@ d ran , he shot an ar@@ row beyond him .
and when the la@@ d was come to the place of the ar@@ row which Jon@@ athan had shot , Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the la@@ d , and said , Is not the ar@@ row beyond the@@ e ?
and Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the la@@ d , Mak@@ e speed , has@@ te , stay not . and Jon@@ athan 's la@@ d gathered up the ar@@ ro@@ ws , and came to his master .
but the la@@ d knew not any thing : only Jon@@ athan and David knew the matter .
then came David to No@@ b to A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the pri@@ est : and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch was afraid at the meeting of David , and said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y art th@@ ou alone , and no man with the@@ e ?
and the pri@@ est answ@@ ered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hal@@ low@@ ed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g , an E@@ dom@@ ite , the chi@@ ef@@ est of the her@@ d@@ men that belonged to Sa@@ ul .
and David ar@@ ose , and fled that day for fear of Sa@@ ul , and went to A@@ ch@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
have I need of ma@@ d men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the ma@@ d man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
David therefore depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and escaped to the cave Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and when his bre@@ th@@ ren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down th@@ ither to him .
then answ@@ ered Do@@ e@@ g the E@@ dom@@ ite , which was set over the servants of Sa@@ ul , and said , I saw the son of J@@ es@@ se coming to No@@ b , to A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b .
then the king sent to call A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the pri@@ est , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and all his father 's house , the pri@@ ests that were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
and one of the sons of A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , named A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , escaped , and fled after David .
abide th@@ ou with me , fear not : for he that seek@@ eth my life seek@@ eth TH@@ Y life : but with me th@@ ou s@@ halt be in safeguard .
so David and his men went to Ke@@ il@@ ah , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brought away their c@@ attle , and smo@@ te them with a great sla@@ ughter . so David sav@@ ed the inhabitants of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
and it came to pass , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
and Sa@@ ul called all the people together to war , to go down to Ke@@ il@@ ah , to bes@@ i@@ ege David and his men .
and David saw that Sa@@ ul was come out to seek his life : and David was in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h in a wood .
and they two made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant before the Lord : and David abo@@ de in the wood , and Jon@@ athan went to his house .
then came up the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , Do@@ th not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on ?
now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of TH@@ Y sou@@ l to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king 's hand .
go , I pra@@ y you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his ha@@ un@@ t is , and who hat@@ h seen him there : for it is told me that he deal@@ eth very sub@@ til@@ ly .
and they ar@@ ose , and went to Z@@ ip@@ h before Sa@@ ul : but David and his men were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on , in the pla@@ in on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on .
but there came a mes@@ sen@@ ger un@@ to Sa@@ ul , saying , has@@ te the@@ e , and come ; for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have inv@@ aded the land .
and David went up from th@@ ence , and d@@ wel@@ t in strong holds at En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
and it came to pass , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
then Sa@@ ul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the ro@@ cks of the wild go@@ ats .
and he came to the she@@ ep@@ co@@ tes by the way , where was a cave ; and Sa@@ ul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
and it came to pass after@@ ward , that David 's heart smo@@ te him , because he had cut off Sa@@ ul 's sk@@ ir@@ t .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Sa@@ ul . but Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also ar@@ ose after@@ ward , and went out of the cave , and cri@@ ed after Sa@@ ul , saying , My lor@@ d the king . and when Sa@@ ul looked behind him , David sto@@ op@@ ed with his face to the ear@@ th , and bo@@ wed himself .
the Lord judge between me and the@@ e , and the Lord av@@ en@@ ge me of the@@ e : but mine hand shall not be upon the@@ e .
as sa@@ ith the pro@@ ver@@ b of the an@@ ci@@ ents , W@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess proce@@ ede@@ th from the w@@ ic@@ ked : but mine hand shall not be upon the@@ e .
after whom is the king of Israel come out ? after whom dost th@@ ou pursue ? after a dead do@@ g , after a fle@@ a .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed this day how that th@@ ou h@@ ast dealt well with me : for@@ as@@ much as when the Lord had delivered me into th@@ ine hand , th@@ ou kil@@ led@@ st me not .
for if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? where@@ fore the Lord reward the@@ e good for that th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to me this day .
and now , be@@ hold , I know well that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely be king , and that the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel shall be established in th@@ ine hand .
swe@@ ar now therefore un@@ to me by the Lord , that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said un@@ to the young men , G@@ et you up to Car@@ mel , and go to Nab@@ al , and gre@@ et him in my name :
and thus shall ye say to him that li@@ vet@@ h in prosperity , Peace be both to the@@ e , and peace be to th@@ ine house , and peace be un@@ to all that th@@ ou h@@ ast .
and now I have heard that th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ hear@@ ers : now TH@@ Y she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing un@@ to them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
and when David 's young men came , they sp@@ ake to Nab@@ al according to all those words in the name of David , and ce@@ ased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my f@@ les@@ h that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it un@@ to men , whom I know not wh@@ ence they be ?
so David 's young men turned their way , and went again , and came and told him all those say@@ ings .
they were a wall un@@ to us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the she@@ ep .
so and more also do God un@@ to the enem@@ ies of David , if I leave of all that per@@ tain to him by the morning light any that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall .
and when A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il saw David , she has@@ ted , and ligh@@ ted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground ,
and now this b@@ les@@ sing which th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id hat@@ h brought un@@ to my lor@@ d , let it even be given un@@ to the young men that follow my lor@@ d .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and it came to pass about ten days after , that the Lord smo@@ te Nab@@ al , that he died .
and when the servants of David were come to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il to Car@@ mel , they sp@@ ake un@@ to her , saying , David sent us un@@ to the@@ e to take the@@ e to him to wife .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il has@@ ted , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
and the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes came un@@ to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , Do@@ th not David hide himself in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before J@@ es@@ him@@ on ?
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
and Sa@@ ul pit@@ ched in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before J@@ es@@ him@@ on , by the way . but David abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
David therefore sent out sp@@ ies , and understood that Sa@@ ul was come in very de@@ ed .
David said furthermore , As the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , the Lord shall sm@@ ite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall des@@ cen@@ d into battle , and per@@ ish .
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill af@@ ar off ; a great space being between them :
and he said , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do@@ th my lor@@ d thus pursue after his ser@@ vant ? for what have I done ? or what ev@@ il is in mine hand ?
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the ear@@ th before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one do@@ th hunt a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains .
and David answ@@ ered and said , be@@ hold the king 's spe@@ ar ! and let one of the young men come over and f@@ et@@ ch it .
the Lord ren@@ der to every man his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and his fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness : for the Lord delivered the@@ e into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's ano@@ in@@ ted .
and , be@@ hold , as TH@@ Y life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tri@@ bu@@ lation .
and David ar@@ ose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him un@@ to A@@ ch@@ ish , the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
and David d@@ wel@@ t with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
and it was told Sa@@ ul that David was fled to G@@ ath : and he sought no more again for him .
and the time that David d@@ wel@@ t in the country of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was a full year and four months .
and A@@ ch@@ ish said , W@@ hi@@ ther have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Ju@@ da@@ h , and against the south of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and against the south of the Ken@@ ites .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . and Sa@@ ul had put away those that had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered themselves together , and came and pit@@ ched in Sh@@ un@@ em : and Sa@@ ul gathered all Israel together , and they pit@@ ched in G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
and when Sa@@ ul saw the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly tre@@ m@@ b@@ led .
and when Sa@@ ul inqu@@ ired of the Lord , the Lord answ@@ ered him not , neither by dre@@ ams nor by U@@ rim , nor by pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and Sa@@ ul sw@@ are to her by the Lord , saying , As the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , there shall no punishment happen to the@@ e for this thing .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice : and the woman sp@@ ake to Sa@@ ul , saying , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou dec@@ e@@ ived me ? for th@@ ou art Sa@@ ul .
because th@@ ou obe@@ yed@@ st not the voice of the Lord , nor execu@@ ted@@ st his fierce wr@@ ath upon A@@ mal@@ ek , therefore hat@@ h the Lord done this thing un@@ to the@@ e this day .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , he@@ arken th@@ ou also un@@ to the voice of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before the@@ e ; and eat , that th@@ ou may@@ est have strength , when th@@ ou go@@ est on TH@@ Y way .
and the woman had a f@@ at cal@@ f in the house ; and she has@@ ted , and killed it , and took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and did bak@@ e un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread there@@ of :
and she brought it before Sa@@ ul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together all their armies to A@@ ph@@ ek : and the Isra@@ eli@@ tes pit@@ ched by a fo@@ un@@ tain which is in J@@ ez@@ reel .
and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but David and his men passed on in the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward with A@@ ch@@ ish .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , Sa@@ ul sle@@ w his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now rise up early in the morning with TH@@ Y master 's servants that are come with the@@ e : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part .
so David and his men rose up early to de@@ part in the morning , to return into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and had taken the women cap@@ tives , that were there@@ in : they sle@@ w not any , either great or small , but carried them away , and went on their way .
so David and his men came to the city , and , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
and David 's two wi@@ ves were taken cap@@ tives , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
we made an inv@@ asion upon the south of the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and upon the coast which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and upon the south of Cal@@ e@@ b ; and we burned Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g with fire .
and there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , neither sp@@ oil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : David recovered all .
and it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordin@@ ance for Israel un@@ to this day .
and to them which were in Hor@@ ma@@ h , and to them which were in Ch@@ or @@@ -@@ @ ash@@ an , and to them which were in Ath@@ ach ,
and to them which were in He@@ br@@ on , and to all the places where David himself and his men were won@@ t to ha@@ un@@ t .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and fell down sla@@ in in mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard upon Sa@@ ul and upon his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , Sa@@ ul 's sons .
and the battle went sor@@ e against Sa@@ ul , and the ar@@ chers hit him ; and he was sor@@ e wounded of the ar@@ chers .
and when his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er saw that Sa@@ ul was dead , he fell likewise upon his s@@ word , and died with him .
so Sa@@ ul died , and his three sons , and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er , and all his men , that same day together .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his three sons fallen in mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
and they cut off his head , and stri@@ pped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their id@@ ols , and among the people .
and they put his arm@@ our in the house of Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : and they fas@@ tened his body to the wall of Beth @@@ -@@ @ S@@ han .
and when the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad heard of that which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had done to Sa@@ ul ;
now it came to pass after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had abo@@ de two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
and when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called un@@ to me . and I answ@@ ered , H@@ ere am I@@ .
then David took hold on his clo@@ th@@ es , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until even , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
and David lamen@@ ted with this lament@@ ation over Sa@@ ul and over Jon@@ athan his son :
( also he b@@ ade them te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the use of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ her . )
tell it not in G@@ ath , publish it not in the streets of As@@ k@@ el@@ on ; lest the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines re@@ jo@@ ice , lest the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised triumph .
from the blood of the sla@@ in , from the f@@ at of the m@@ igh@@ ty , the bo@@ w of Jon@@ athan turned not back , and the s@@ word of Sa@@ ul returned not empty .
Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan were lov@@ ely and pleas@@ ant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les , they were stronger than li@@ ons .
Y@@ e da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Israel , we@@ ep over Sa@@ ul , who clo@@ th@@ ed you in scar@@ let , with other deli@@ ghts , who put on or@@ nam@@ ents of gold upon your appar@@ el .
how are the m@@ igh@@ ty fallen in the mid@@ st of the battle ! O Jon@@ athan , th@@ ou was sla@@ in in th@@ ine high places .
I am dist@@ ressed for the@@ e , my brother Jon@@ athan : very pleas@@ ant h@@ ast th@@ ou been un@@ to me : TH@@ Y love to me was won@@ der@@ ful , passing the love of women .
so David went up th@@ ither , and his two wi@@ ves also , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il Nab@@ al 's wife the Car@@ mel@@ ite .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . and they told David , saying , That the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad were they that buried Sa@@ ul .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and said un@@ to them , b@@ les@@ sed be ye of the Lord , that ye have she@@ wed this kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to your lor@@ d , even un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
and now the Lord she@@ w kin@@ d@@ ness and truth un@@ to you : and I also will requ@@ ite you this kin@@ d@@ ness , because ye have done this thing .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye val@@ i@@ ant : for your master Sa@@ ul is dead , and also the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have ano@@ in@@ ted me king over them .
but Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , captain of Sa@@ ul 's host , took Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , and brought him over to Mah@@ an@@ aim ;
Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h Sa@@ ul 's son was for@@ ty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and re@@ ig@@ ned two years . but the house of Ju@@ da@@ h followed David .
and the time that David was king in He@@ br@@ on over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h was seven years and six months .
and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and the servants of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , went out from Mah@@ an@@ aim to Gi@@ be@@ on .
then there ar@@ ose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin , which per@@ tained to Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , and twelve of the servants of David .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : where@@ fore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and there was a very sor@@ e battle that day ; and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
and there were three sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah there , Jo@@ a@@ b , and Ab@@ is@@ hai , and A@@ sah@@ el : and A@@ sah@@ el was as light of fo@@ ot as a wild ro@@ e .
and A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
then Ab@@ ner looked behind him , and said , Art th@@ ou A@@ sah@@ el ? and he answ@@ ered , I am .
and Ab@@ ner said again to A@@ sah@@ el , Tur@@ n the@@ e aside from following me : where@@ fore should I sm@@ ite the@@ e to the ground ? how then should I hold up my face to Jo@@ a@@ b TH@@ Y brother ?
Jo@@ a@@ b also and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that li@@ eth before Gi@@ ah by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
and the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Ab@@ ner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
and Jo@@ a@@ b said , As God li@@ vet@@ h , unless th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st spoken , su@@ rely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
so Jo@@ a@@ b ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et , and all the people stood still , and pursu@@ ed after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
and Ab@@ ner and his men walked all that night through the pla@@ in , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ th@@ ron , and they came to Mah@@ an@@ aim .
and Jo@@ a@@ b returned from following Ab@@ ner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there la@@ cked of David 's servants n@@ in@@ ete@@ en men and A@@ sah@@ el .
but the servants of David had s@@ mit@@ ten of Benjamin , and of Ab@@ ner 's men , so that three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core men died .
and they took up A@@ sah@@ el , and buried him in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father , which was in B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . and Jo@@ a@@ b and his men went all night , and they came to He@@ br@@ on at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David : but David wa@@ xed stronger and stronger , and the house of Sa@@ ul wa@@ xed we@@ aker and we@@ aker .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and the fourth , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ; and the fifth , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of A@@ bi@@ tal ;
and the sixth , I@@ thre@@ am , by Eg@@ lah David 's wife . these were born to David in He@@ br@@ on .
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong for the house of Sa@@ ul .
and Sa@@ ul had a conc@@ ub@@ ine , whose name was R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah : and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h said to Ab@@ ner , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou gone in un@@ to my father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine ?
and her husband went with her along we@@ eping behind her to Ba@@ hur@@ im . then said Ab@@ ner un@@ to him , G@@ o , return . and he returned .
and Ab@@ ner had communication with the el@@ ders of Israel , saying , Y@@ e sought for David in times past to be king over you :
and Ab@@ ner also sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Ab@@ ner came to David to He@@ br@@ on , and twenty men with him . and David made Ab@@ ner and the men that were with him a feast .
T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , and to know TH@@ Y going out and TH@@ Y coming in , and to know all that th@@ ou do@@ est .
and when Jo@@ a@@ b was come out from David , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers after Ab@@ ner , which brought him again from the well of Si@@ ra@@ h : but David knew it not .
and after@@ ward when David heard it , he said , I and my k@@ ing@@ dom are guil@@ t@@ less before the Lord for ever from the blood of Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er :
so Jo@@ a@@ b and Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother sle@@ w Ab@@ ner , because he had sla@@ in their brother A@@ sah@@ el at Gi@@ be@@ on in the battle .
and they buried Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on : and the king lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt at the grave of Ab@@ ner ; and all the people we@@ pt .
TH@@ Y hands were not bound , nor TH@@ Y feet put into f@@ et@@ ters : as a man fal@@ le@@ th before w@@ ic@@ ked men , so fel@@ lest th@@ ou . and all the people we@@ pt again over him .
and all the people took no@@ tice of it , and it pleased them : as wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the king did pleased all the people .
for all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to s@@ lay Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er .
and I am this day weak , though ano@@ in@@ ted king ; and these men the sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah be too hard for me : the Lord shall reward the do@@ er of ev@@ il according to his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
and when Sa@@ ul 's son heard that Ab@@ ner was dead in He@@ br@@ on , his hands were fe@@ e@@ ble , and all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes were troubled .
how much more , when w@@ ic@@ ked men have sla@@ in a righ@@ te@@ ous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the ear@@ th ?
then came all the tri@@ bes of Israel to David un@@ to He@@ br@@ on , and sp@@ ake , saying , be@@ hold , we are TH@@ Y bone and TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h .
so all the el@@ ders of Israel came to the king to He@@ br@@ on ; and king David made a league with them in He@@ br@@ on before the Lord : and they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel .
in He@@ br@@ on he re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h seven years and six months : and in Jer@@ usalem he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty and three years over all Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
nevertheless David took the strong hold of Z@@ ion : the same is the city of David .
and David went on , and grew great , and the Lord God of hosts was with him .
and David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that he had ex@@ al@@ ted his k@@ ing@@ dom for his people Israel 's sake .
and David took him more conc@@ ub@@ ines and wi@@ ves out of Jer@@ usalem , after he was come from He@@ br@@ on : and there were yet sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters born to David .
and these be the names of those that were born un@@ to him in Jer@@ usalem ; Sh@@ am@@ mu@@ a , and Sho@@ ba@@ b , and Na@@ than , and Solomon ,
but when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines also came and spread themselves in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and they set the Ar@@ k of God upon a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b that was in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hi@@ o , the sons of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , dra@@ ve the new c@@ art .
and when they came to N@@ ach@@ on 's th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , Uz@@ z@@ ah put forth his hand to the Ar@@ k of God , and took hold of it ; for the ox@@ en sho@@ ok it .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ z@@ ah ; and God smo@@ te him there for his er@@ ror ; and there he died by the Ar@@ k of God .
and David was disp@@ le@@ ased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uz@@ z@@ ah : and he called the name of the place Per@@ ez @@@ -@@ @ uz@@ z@@ ah to this day .
so David would not remove the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and the Ar@@ k of the Lord continued in the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te three months : and the Lord b@@ les@@ sed Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and all his household .
and it was so , that when they that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the Lord had gone six p@@ aces , he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed ox@@ en and fat@@ lings .
and David dan@@ ced before the Lord with all his might ; and David was gir@@ ded with a lin@@ en ep@@ ho@@ d .
so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et .
and as the Ar@@ k of the Lord came into the city of David , Mic@@ hal Sa@@ ul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before the Lord ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and as soon as David had made an end of offering bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
and it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enem@@ ies ;
and it came to pass that night , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Na@@ than , saying ,
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I was with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies out of TH@@ Y sight , and have made the@@ e a great name , like un@@ to the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and when TH@@ Y days be fulfilled , and th@@ ou s@@ halt sle@@ ep with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , I will set up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall proceed out of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
but my mer@@ cy shall not de@@ part away from him , as I took it from Sa@@ ul , whom I put away before the@@ e .
and th@@ ine house and TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom shall be established for ever before the@@ e : TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one shall be established for ever .
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Na@@ than speak un@@ to David .
then went king David in , and sat before the Lord , and he said , Wh@@ o am I , O Lord God ? and what is my house , that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought me hi@@ ther@@ to ?
for TH@@ Y word 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , h@@ ast th@@ ou done all these great things , to make TH@@ Y ser@@ vant know them .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore th@@ ou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like the@@ e , neither is there any God bes@@ ide the@@ e , according to all that we have heard with our e@@ ars .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast confirmed to th@@ y@@ self TH@@ Y people Israel to be a people un@@ to the@@ e for ever : and th@@ ou , Lord , art become their God .
and now , O Lord God , the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken concerning TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
and let TH@@ Y name be mag@@ ni@@ fied for ever , saying , The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel : and let the house of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David be established before the@@ e .
for th@@ ou , O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , h@@ ast revealed to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , saying , I will build the@@ e an house : therefore hat@@ h TH@@ Y ser@@ vant found in his heart to pra@@ y this pray@@ er un@@ to the@@ e .
and now , O Lord God , th@@ ou art that God , and TH@@ Y words be true , and th@@ ou h@@ ast promised this Go@@ od@@ ness un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant :
and after this it came to pass , that David smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sub@@ du@@ ed them : and David took Me@@ the@@ g @@@ -@@ @ am@@ ma@@ h out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
David smo@@ te also Had@@ ade@@ zer , the son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , as he went to rec@@ over his border at the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
and David took from him a thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and seven hundred hor@@ se@@ men , and twenty thousand foot@@ men : and David h@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed all the char@@ i@@ ot hor@@ ses , but reserved of them for an hundred char@@ i@@ ots .
and when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to succ@@ our Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
then David put gar@@ ris@@ ons in Syria of Dam@@ as@@ cus : and the Syri@@ ans became servants to David , and brought gifts . and the Lord preserved David w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went .
and David took the shi@@ elds of gold that were on the servants of Had@@ ade@@ zer , and brought them to Jer@@ usalem .
and from Bet@@ ah , and from Ber@@ o@@ th@@ ai , cities of Had@@ ade@@ zer , king David took exceeding much br@@ ass .
and David g@@ at him a name when he returned from s@@ mit@@ ing of the Syri@@ ans in the val@@ ley of salt , being E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men .
and he put gar@@ ris@@ ons in E@@ dom ; throughout all E@@ dom put he gar@@ ris@@ ons , and all they of E@@ dom became David 's servants . and the Lord preserved David w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went .
and David re@@ ig@@ ned over all Israel ; and David executed judgment and justice un@@ to all his people .
and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah was over the host ; and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud was rec@@ order ;
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and Ser@@ ai@@ ah was the s@@ cri@@ be ;
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over both the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites ; and David 's sons were chief rul@@ ers .
and the king said un@@ to him , W@@ here is he ? and Z@@ ib@@ a said un@@ to the king , be@@ hold , he is in the house of Mac@@ hir , the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , in L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Debar .
then king David sent , and f@@ et@@ ched him out of the house of Mac@@ hir , the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , from L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Debar .
then the king called to Z@@ ib@@ a , Sa@@ ul 's ser@@ vant , and said un@@ to him , I have given un@@ to TH@@ Y master 's son all that per@@ tained to Sa@@ ul and to all his house .
and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h had a young son , whose name was Mic@@ ha . and all that d@@ wel@@ t in the house of Z@@ ib@@ a were servants un@@ to M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h .
so M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem : for he did eat continu@@ ally at the king 's table ; and was la@@ me on both his feet .
and it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and Han@@ un his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore Han@@ un took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their gar@@ ments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
and he said , If the Syri@@ ans be too strong for me , then th@@ ou s@@ halt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for the@@ e , then I will come and help the@@ e .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the Lord do that which se@@ eme@@ th him good .
and Jo@@ a@@ b drew n@@ igh , and the people that were with him , un@@ to the battle against the Syri@@ ans : and they fled before him .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were s@@ mit@@ ten before Israel , they gathered themselves together .
and Had@@ are@@ zer sent , and brought out the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and they came to He@@ lam ; and Sho@@ b@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to He@@ lam . and the Syri@@ ans set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and David sent and inqu@@ ired after the woman . and one said , Is not this B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , the daughter of Eli@@ am , the wife of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te ?
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and took her ; and she came in un@@ to him , and he lay with her ; for she was pur@@ ified from her un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess : and she returned un@@ to her house .
and when U@@ ri@@ ah was come un@@ to him , David demanded of him how Jo@@ a@@ b did , and how the people did , and how the war prosp@@ ered .
and David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , G@@ o down to TH@@ Y house , and was@@ h TH@@ Y feet . and U@@ ri@@ ah depar@@ ted out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mes@@ s of meat from the king .
but U@@ ri@@ ah sle@@ pt at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lor@@ d , and went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , S@@ et ye U@@ ri@@ ah in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the hot@@ test battle , and re@@ tire ye from him , that he may be s@@ mit@@ ten , and die .
and it came to pass , when Jo@@ a@@ b observed the city , that he assigned U@@ ri@@ ah un@@ to a place where he knew that val@@ i@@ ant men were .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Jo@@ a@@ b : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te died also .
and charged the mes@@ sen@@ ger , saying , When th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of telling the matters of the war un@@ to the king ,
and if so be that the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore appro@@ ached ye so n@@ igh un@@ to the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
and the sho@@ o@@ ters shot from off the wall upon TH@@ Y servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te is dead also .
and when the wife of U@@ ri@@ ah heard that U@@ ri@@ ah her husband was dead , she mour@@ ned for her husband .
and the Lord sent Na@@ than un@@ to David . and he came un@@ to him , and said un@@ to him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
and David 's an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against the man ; and he said to Na@@ than , As the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , the man that hat@@ h done this thing shall su@@ rely die :
and he shall restore the lam@@ b fo@@ ur@@ fold , because he did this thing , and because he had no p@@ ity .
now therefore the s@@ word shall never de@@ part from th@@ ine house ; because th@@ ou h@@ ast desp@@ ised me , and h@@ ast taken the wife of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te to be TH@@ Y wife .
and David said un@@ to Na@@ than , I have sin@@ ned against the Lord . and Na@@ than said un@@ to David , The Lord also hat@@ h put away TH@@ Y sin ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not die .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it , because by this de@@ ed th@@ ou h@@ ast given great occasion to the enem@@ ies of the Lord to b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme , the child also that is born un@@ to the@@ e shall su@@ rely die .
and Na@@ than depar@@ ted un@@ to his house . and the Lord struck the child that U@@ ri@@ ah 's wife b@@ are un@@ to David , and it was very si@@ ck .
David therefore bes@@ ought God for the child ; and David fas@@ ted , and went in , and lay all night upon the ear@@ th .
and the el@@ ders of his house ar@@ ose , and went to him , to raise him up from the ear@@ th : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
but when David saw that his servants wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed , David perceived that the child was dead : therefore David said un@@ to his servants , Is the child dead ? and they said , He is dead .
then said his servants un@@ to him , What thing is this that th@@ ou h@@ ast done ? th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st fast and we@@ ep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st rise and eat bread .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and en@@ camp against the city , and take it : lest I take the city , and it be called after my name .
and David gathered all the people together , and went to R@@ ab@@ bah , and fought against it , and took it .
and it came to pass after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tam@@ ar ; and Am@@ non the son of David lov@@ ed her .
and Am@@ non was so v@@ ex@@ ed , that he fell si@@ ck for his sister Tam@@ ar ; for she was a vir@@ gin ; and Am@@ non thought it hard for him to do any thing to her .
but Am@@ non had a friend , whose name was Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b , the son of Shi@@ me@@ ah David 's brother : and Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b was a very sub@@ til man .
and she took a pan , and p@@ oured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Am@@ non said , H@@ ave out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and Am@@ non said un@@ to Tam@@ ar , Br@@ ing the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of th@@ ine hand . and Tam@@ ar took the cak@@ es which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Am@@ non her brother .
and when she had brought them un@@ to him to eat , he took hold of her , and said un@@ to her , C@@ ome lie with me , my sister .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it he would not he@@ arken un@@ to her voice : but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her .
then he called his ser@@ vant that minist@@ ered un@@ to him , and said , P@@ ut now this woman out from me , and bol@@ t the door after her .
and she had a gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs upon her : for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that were vir@@ g@@ ins appar@@ elled . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and rent her gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on cr@@ ying .
but when king David heard of all these things , he was very wro@@ th .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om sp@@ ake un@@ to his brother Am@@ non neither good nor bad : for Ab@@ sal@@ om ha@@ ted Am@@ non , because he had forced his sister Tam@@ ar .
and the king said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , N@@ ay , my son , let us not all now go , lest we be char@@ ge@@ able un@@ to the@@ e . and he pressed him : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it he would not go , but b@@ les@@ sed him .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om pressed him , that he let Am@@ non and all the king 's sons go with him .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hat@@ h sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
then the king ar@@ ose , and tar@@ e his gar@@ ments , and lay on the ear@@ th ; and all his servants stood by with their clo@@ th@@ es rent .
now therefore let not my lor@@ d the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Am@@ non only is dead .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b said un@@ to the king , be@@ hold , the king 's sons come : as TH@@ Y ser@@ vant said , so it is .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled , and went to Tal@@ ma@@ i , the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud , king of G@@ es@@ hur . and David mour@@ ned for his son every day .
and the sou@@ l of king David lon@@ ged to go forth un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om : for he was comfor@@ ted concerning Am@@ non , seeing he was dead .
and come to the king , and speak on this manner un@@ to him . so Jo@@ a@@ b put the words in her m@@ outh .
and when the woman of Tek@@ o@@ ah sp@@ ake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and said , Hel@@ p , O king .
and TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id had two sons , and they two stro@@ ve together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smo@@ te the other , and sle@@ w him .
and the woman of Tek@@ o@@ ah said un@@ to the king , My lor@@ d , O king , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity be on me , and on my father 's house : and the king and his th@@ r@@ one be guil@@ t@@ less .
for the king will hear , to deliver his hand@@ ma@@ id out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inher@@ it@@ ance of God .
then the king answ@@ ered and said un@@ to the woman , hide not from me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , the thing that I shall ask the@@ e . and the woman said , Let my lor@@ d the king now speak .
to f@@ et@@ ch about this form of speech hat@@ h TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jo@@ a@@ b done this thing : and my lor@@ d is wise , according to the wis@@ dom of an an@@ gel of God , to know all things that are in the ear@@ th .
and the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so Ab@@ sal@@ om returned to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
and un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a fair coun@@ tenance .
so Ab@@ sal@@ om d@@ wel@@ t two full years in Jer@@ usalem , and saw not the king 's face .
therefore Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for Jo@@ a@@ b , to have sent him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
then Jo@@ a@@ b ar@@ ose , and came to Ab@@ sal@@ om un@@ to his house , and said un@@ to him , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have TH@@ Y servants set my field on fire ?
so Jo@@ a@@ b came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bo@@ wed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king k@@ is@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and it came to pass after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ ses , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
and it was so , that when any man came n@@ igh to him to do him obe@@ is@@ ance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and on this manner did Ab@@ sal@@ om to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Ab@@ sal@@ om st@@ ole the hear@@ ts of the men of Israel .
and with Ab@@ sal@@ om went two hundred men out of Jer@@ usalem , that were called ; and they went in their simp@@ lic@@ ity , and they knew not any thing .
and there came a mes@@ sen@@ ger to David , saying , The hear@@ ts of the men of Israel are after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and the king 's servants said un@@ to the king , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants are ready to do wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever my lor@@ d the king shall appoint .
and the king went forth , and all his household after him . and the king left ten women , which were conc@@ ub@@ ines , to keep the house .
and the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tar@@ ried in a place that was far off .
and all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men which came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
then said the king to I@@ t@@ ta@@ i the G@@ itti@@ te , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore go@@ est th@@ ou also with us ? return to TH@@ Y place , and abide with the king : for th@@ ou art a st@@ ran@@ ger , and also an ex@@ ile .
and David said to I@@ t@@ ta@@ i , G@@ o and pass over . and I@@ t@@ ta@@ i the G@@ itti@@ te passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
and all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but if he thus say , I have no de@@ light in the@@ e ; be@@ hold , here am I , let him do to me as se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to him .
see , I will tar@@ ry in the pla@@ in of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , until there come word from you to certi@@ fy me .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shi@@ pped God , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at rent , and ear@@ th upon his head :
and h@@ ast th@@ ou not there with the@@ e Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt hear out of the king 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them ye shall send un@@ to me every thing that ye can hear .
then said the king to Z@@ ib@@ a , be@@ hold , th@@ ine are all that per@@ tained un@@ to M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h . and Z@@ ib@@ a said , I hum@@ bly bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e that I may find grace in TH@@ Y sight , my lor@@ d , O king .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that the Lord will look on mine aff@@ li@@ ction , and that the Lord will requ@@ ite me good for his cur@@ sing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shi@@ me@@ i went along on the hill 's side over against him , and Cur@@ sed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast d@@ ust .
and the king , and all the people that were with him , came we@@ ary , and ref@@ res@@ hed themselves there .
and it came to pass , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , was come un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hus@@ hai said un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om , N@@ ay ; but whom the Lord , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
and again , whom should I serve ? should I not serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in TH@@ Y father 's presence , so will I be in TH@@ Y presence .
so they spread Ab@@ sal@@ om a tent upon the top of the house ; and Ab@@ sal@@ om went in un@@ to his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines in the sight of all Israel .
and I will come upon him while he is we@@ ary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will sm@@ ite the king only :
and I will bring back all the people un@@ to the@@ e : the man whom th@@ ou seek@@ est is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t : for all Israel know@@ eth that TH@@ Y father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
then said Hus@@ hai un@@ to Zad@@ ok and to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests , Th@@ us and thus did A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el coun@@ sel Ab@@ sal@@ om and the el@@ ders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I coun@@ sel@@ led .
and the woman took and spread a covering over the well 's m@@ outh , and spread ground cor@@ n there@@ on ; and the thing was not known .
then David ar@@ ose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there la@@ cked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
then David came to Mah@@ an@@ aim . and Ab@@ sal@@ om passed over Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om made A@@ masa captain of the host instead of Jo@@ a@@ b : which A@@ masa was a man 's son , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra an Isra@@ elite , that went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
and David num@@ ber@@ ed the people that were with him , and set cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds over them .
and the king comman@@ ded Jo@@ a@@ b and Ab@@ is@@ hai and I@@ t@@ ta@@ i , saying , De@@ al g@@ ently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and all the people heard when the king gave all the cap@@ tains charge concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the wood of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ;
where the people of Israel were sla@@ in before the servants of David , and there was there a great sla@@ ughter that day of twenty thousand men .
for the battle was there sc@@ at@@ tered over the face of all the country : and the wood dev@@ oured more people that day than the s@@ word dev@@ oured .
otherwise I should have w@@ rought fal@@ se@@ hood against mine own life : for there is no matter hi@@ d from the king , and th@@ ou th@@ y@@ self wo@@ ul@@ dest have set th@@ y@@ self against me .
and ten young men that b@@ are Jo@@ a@@ b 's arm@@ our comp@@ ass@@ ed about and smo@@ te Ab@@ sal@@ om , and sle@@ w him .
and they took Ab@@ sal@@ om , and cast him into a great p@@ it in the wood , and laid a very great he@@ ap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
then said Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az the son of Zad@@ ok , Let me now run , and bear the king ti@@ dings , how that the Lord hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged him of his enem@@ ies .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of over the gate un@@ to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold a man running alone .
and the watch@@ man cri@@ ed , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is ti@@ dings in his m@@ outh . and he came Ap@@ ace , and drew near .
and the victory that day was turned into mourning un@@ to all the people : for the people heard say that day how the king was gri@@ ev@@ ed for his son .
and the people g@@ at them by ste@@ alth that day into the city , as people being as@@ ha@@ med ste@@ al away when they flee in battle .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om , whom we ano@@ in@@ ted over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ?
Y@@ e are my bre@@ th@@ ren , ye are my b@@ ones and my f@@ les@@ h : where@@ fore then are ye the last to bring back the king ?
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Ju@@ da@@ h came to G@@ ilg@@ al , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , be@@ hold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king .
but Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered and said , shall not Shi@@ me@@ i be put to death for this , because he Cur@@ sed the Lord 's ano@@ in@@ ted ?
therefore the king said un@@ to Shi@@ me@@ i , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not die . and the king sw@@ are un@@ to him .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jer@@ usalem to meet the king , that the king said un@@ to him , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore w@@ en@@ test not th@@ ou with me , M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ?
and he hat@@ h s@@ lan@@ dered TH@@ Y ser@@ vant un@@ to my lor@@ d the king ; but my lor@@ d the king is as an an@@ gel of God : do therefore what is good in th@@ ine eyes .
and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h said un@@ to the king , Ye@@ a , let him take all , for@@ as@@ much as my lor@@ d the king is come again in peace un@@ to his own house .
and Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te came down from Ro@@ gel@@ im , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
now Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even fo@@ ur@@ score years old : and he had provided the king of sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Mah@@ an@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
TH@@ Y ser@@ vant will go a little way over Jordan with the king : and why should the king re@@ compen@@ se it me with such a reward ?
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king k@@ is@@ sed Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , and b@@ les@@ sed him ; and he returned un@@ to his own place .
then the king went on to G@@ ilg@@ al , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went on with him : and all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
so every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri : but the men of Ju@@ da@@ h cla@@ ve un@@ to their king , from Jordan even to Jer@@ usalem .
so A@@ masa went to assem@@ ble the men of Ju@@ da@@ h : but he tar@@ ried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
and there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men : and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
and one of Jo@@ a@@ b 's men stood by him , and said , He that fav@@ ou@@ re@@ th Jo@@ a@@ b , and he that is for David , let him go after Jo@@ a@@ b .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Jo@@ a@@ b , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
and he went through all the tri@@ bes of Israel un@@ to A@@ bel , and to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then cri@@ ed a wise woman out of the city , He@@ ar , hear ; say , I pra@@ y you , un@@ to Jo@@ a@@ b , C@@ ome near hi@@ ther , that I may speak with the@@ e .
then she sp@@ ake , saying , They were won@@ t to speak in old time , saying , They shall su@@ rely ask coun@@ sel at A@@ bel : and so they ended the matter .
now Jo@@ a@@ b was over all the host of Israel : and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and over the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites :
and Sh@@ eva was s@@ cri@@ be : and Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar were the pri@@ ests :
and it was told David what R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , the conc@@ ub@@ ine of Sa@@ ul , had done .
and he brought up from th@@ ence the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and the b@@ ones of Jon@@ athan his son ; and they gathered the b@@ ones of them that were han@@ ged .
moreover the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and David wa@@ xed fa@@ int .
and it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w Sap@@ h , which was of the sons of the giant .
and there was again a battle in Go@@ b with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ o@@ regi@@ m , a B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
these four were born to the giant in G@@ ath , and fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
I will call on the Lord , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from mine enem@@ ies .
when the waves of death comp@@ ass@@ ed me , the floods of un@@ go@@ dly men made me afraid ;
there went up a smoke out of his nos@@ tr@@ ils , and fire out of his m@@ outh dev@@ oured : co@@ als were kin@@ d@@ led by it .
he bo@@ wed the heav@@ ens also , and came down ; and d@@ ark@@ ness was under his feet .
and he ro@@ de upon a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and did fly : and he was seen upon the w@@ ings of the wind .
and he made d@@ ark@@ ness pav@@ ili@@ ons round about him , dark waters , and th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sk@@ ies .
through the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness before him were co@@ als of fire kin@@ d@@ led .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the re@@ bu@@ king of the Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
he sent from above , he took me ; he drew me out of many waters ;
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that ha@@ ted me : for they were too strong for me .
they prevented me in the day of my cal@@ am@@ ity : but the Lord was my stay .
he brought me forth also into a large place : he delivered me , because he deli@@ gh@@ ted in me .
the Lord re@@ warded me according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : according to the cle@@ ann@@ ess of my hands hat@@ h he re@@ compen@@ sed me .
for I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly depar@@ ted from my God .
for all his judg@@ ments were before me : and as for his stat@@ utes , I did not de@@ part from them .
I was also u@@ pri@@ ght before him , and have kept myself from mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
therefore the Lord hat@@ h re@@ compen@@ sed me according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; according to my cle@@ ann@@ ess in his eye sight .
with the mer@@ ci@@ ful th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self mer@@ ci@@ ful , and with the u@@ pri@@ ght man th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self u@@ pri@@ ght .
with the p@@ ure th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self p@@ ure ; and with the fro@@ ward th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self un@@ sav@@ our@@ y .
and the aff@@ lic@@ ted people th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save : but th@@ ine eyes are upon the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring them down .
for by the@@ e I have run through a troop : by my God have I le@@ ap@@ ed over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried : he is a bu@@ ck@@ ler to all them that trust in him .
for who is God , save the Lord ? and who is a rock , save our God ?
God is my strength and power : and he mak@@ eth my way perfect .
he mak@@ eth my feet like hin@@ ds ' feet : and set@@ te@@ th me upon my high places .
he teach@@ eth my hands to war ; so that a bo@@ w of steel is broken by mine arms .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also given me the shield of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : and TH@@ Y g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess hat@@ h made me great .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast en@@ lar@@ ged my steps under me ; so that my feet did not sli@@ p .
I have pursu@@ ed mine enem@@ ies , and destroyed them ; and turned not again until I had consu@@ med them .
and I have consu@@ med them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : ye@@ a , they are fallen under my feet .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast gir@@ ded me with strength to battle : them that rose up against me h@@ ast th@@ ou sub@@ du@@ ed under me .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also given me the nec@@ ks of mine enem@@ ies , that I might destroy them that h@@ ate me .
they looked , but there was none to save ; even un@@ to the Lord , but he answ@@ ered them not .
then did I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , I did stamp them as the m@@ ire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
T@@ ho@@ u also h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people , th@@ ou h@@ ast kept me to be head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
S@@ tran@@ gers shall submit themselves un@@ to me : as soon as they hear , they shall be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to me .
the Lord li@@ vet@@ h ; and b@@ les@@ sed be my rock ; and ex@@ al@@ ted be the God of the rock of my sal@@ vation .
it is God that av@@ eng@@ eth me , and that br@@ ing@@ eth down the people under me ,
and that br@@ ing@@ eth me forth from mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou also h@@ ast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , among the he@@ a@@ then , and I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to TH@@ Y name .
he is the to@@ wer of sal@@ vation for his king : and she@@ w@@ eth mer@@ cy to his ano@@ in@@ ted , un@@ to David , and to his se@@ ed for ever@@ more .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of J@@ es@@ se said , and the man who was raised up on high , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the swe@@ et p@@ sal@@ mist of Israel , said ,
the Spiri@@ t of the Lord sp@@ ake by me , and his word was in my ton@@ gue .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel sp@@ ake to me , He that ru@@ le@@ th over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun ris@@ eth , even a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds ; as the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ inging out of the ear@@ th by clear sh@@ ining after rain .
but the sons of Bel@@ ial shall be all of them as thor@@ ns th@@ rust away , because they can@@ not be taken with hands :
but the man that shall touch them must be f@@ enced with iron and the staff of a spe@@ ar ; and they shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly burned with fire in the same place .
and after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of len@@ ti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
but he stood in the mid@@ st of the ground , and defended it , and sle@@ w the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Lord w@@ rought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time un@@ to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
was he not most honour@@ able of three ? therefore he was their captain : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it he at@@ tained not un@@ to the first three .
he was more honour@@ able than the thirty , but he at@@ tained not to the first three . and David set him over his guard .
H@@ ele@@ b the son of Ba@@ an@@ ah , a Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , I@@ t@@ ta@@ i the son of Ri@@ ba@@ i out of Gi@@ be@@ ah of the children of Benjamin ,
Eli@@ phe@@ let the son of Ah@@ as@@ ba@@ i , the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , Eli@@ am the son of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el the G@@ il@@ on@@ ite ,
so when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jer@@ usalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
so the Lord sent a p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba sev@@ enty thousand men .
and G@@ ad came that day to David , and said un@@ to him , G@@ o up , re@@ ar an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Ara@@ un@@ ah the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and David , according to the saying of G@@ ad , went up as the Lord comman@@ ded .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and David built there an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings . so the Lord was in@@ treated for the land , and the pla@@ gue was stayed from Israel .
now king David was old and stric@@ ken in years ; and they covered him with clo@@ th@@ es , but he g@@ at no heat .
so they sought for a fair dam@@ sel throughout all the co@@ asts of Israel , and found Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g a Sh@@ un@@ am@@ m@@ ite , and brought her to the king .
and the dam@@ sel was very fair , and ch@@ er@@ ished the king , and minist@@ ered to him : but the king knew her not .
then Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ex@@ al@@ ted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
and he con@@ ferred with Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and with A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est : and they following Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah helped him .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men which belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
now therefore come , let me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give the@@ e coun@@ sel , that th@@ ou may@@ est save th@@ ine own life , and the life of TH@@ Y son Solomon .
be@@ hold , while th@@ ou yet talk@@ est there with the king , I also will come in after the@@ e , and confirm TH@@ Y words .
and B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba went in un@@ to the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the Sh@@ un@@ am@@ m@@ ite minist@@ ered un@@ to the king .
and now , be@@ hold , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah re@@ ig@@ net@@ h ; and now , my lor@@ d the king , th@@ ou know@@ est it not :
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lor@@ d the king shall sle@@ ep with his fa@@ thers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offen@@ ders .
and , lo , while she yet talked with the king , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t also came in .
and they told the king , saying , be@@ hold Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t . and when he was come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
and Na@@ than said , My lor@@ d , O king , h@@ ast th@@ ou said , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my th@@ r@@ one ?
but me , even me TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Solomon , hat@@ h he not called .
and king David said , C@@ all me Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada . and they came before the king .
the king also said un@@ to them , T@@ ake with you the servants of your lor@@ d , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mul@@ e , and bring him down to G@@ ih@@ on :
and let Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t ano@@ int him there king over Israel : and blow ye with the tr@@ ump@@ et , and say , God save king Solomon .
as the Lord hat@@ h been with my lor@@ d the king , even so be he with Solomon , and make his th@@ r@@ one greater than the th@@ r@@ one of my lor@@ d king David .
and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est took an Hor@@ n of oil out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and ano@@ in@@ ted Solomon . and they ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ et ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th rent with the sound of them .
and Jon@@ athan answ@@ ered and said to Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , Ver@@ ily our lor@@ d king David hat@@ h made Solomon king .
and also thus said the king , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , which hat@@ h given one to sit on my th@@ r@@ one this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and all the guests that were with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way .
and Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah fear@@ ed because of Solomon , and ar@@ ose , and went , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
and Solomon said , If he will she@@ w himself a wor@@ thy man , there shall not an ha@@ ir of him fall to the ear@@ th : but if w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess shall be found in him , he shall die .
now the days of David drew n@@ igh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
but she@@ w kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to the sons of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and let them be of those that eat at TH@@ Y table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Ab@@ sal@@ om TH@@ Y brother .
now therefore hold him not guil@@ t@@ less : for th@@ ou art a wise man , and know@@ est what th@@ ou ou@@ gh@@ test to do un@@ to him ; but his ho@@ ar head bring th@@ ou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel were for@@ ty years : seven years re@@ ig@@ ned he in He@@ br@@ on , and thirty and three years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem .
then sat Solomon upon the th@@ r@@ one of David his father ; and his k@@ ing@@ dom was established greatly .
and Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h came to B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba the mother of Solomon . and she said , Co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou peac@@ e@@ ably ? and he said , Peac@@ e@@ ably .
then she said , I desire one small petition of the@@ e ; I pra@@ y the@@ e , say me not n@@ ay . and the king said un@@ to her , As@@ k on , my mother : for I will not say the@@ e n@@ ay .
and king Solomon sent by the hand of Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est un@@ to the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
then ti@@ dings came to Jo@@ a@@ b : for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he turned not after Ab@@ sal@@ om . and Jo@@ a@@ b fled un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
so Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell upon him , and sle@@ w him : and he was buried in his own house in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the king put Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada in his room over the host : and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est did the king put in the room of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar .
for it shall be , that on the day th@@ ou go@@ est out , and pass@@ est over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , th@@ ou s@@ halt know for certain that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die : TH@@ Y blood shall be upon th@@ ine own head .
and Shi@@ me@@ i ar@@ ose , and s@@ add@@ led his ass , and went to G@@ ath to A@@ ch@@ ish to seek his servants : and Shi@@ me@@ i went , and brought his servants from G@@ ath .
and it was told Solomon that Shi@@ me@@ i had gone from Jer@@ usalem to G@@ ath , and was come again .
why then h@@ ast th@@ ou not kept the oath of the Lord , and the comman@@ d@@ ment that I have charged the@@ e with ?
the king said moreover to Shi@@ me@@ i , T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est all the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess which th@@ ine heart is priv@@ y to , that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st to David my father : therefore the Lord shall return TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess upon th@@ ine own head ;
and the king went to Gi@@ be@@ on to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings did Solomon offer upon that alt@@ ar .
and now , O Lord my God , th@@ ou h@@ ast made TH@@ Y ser@@ vant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant is in the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y people which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , a great people , that can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed nor counted for multi@@ tude .
and the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
and I have also given the@@ e that which th@@ ou h@@ ast not asked , both ri@@ ches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like un@@ to the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk in my ways , to keep my stat@@ utes and my comman@@ d@@ ments , as TH@@ Y father David did walk , then I will leng@@ then TH@@ Y days .
then came there two women , that were har@@ lots , un@@ to the king , and stood before him .
and the one woman said , O my lor@@ d , I and this woman d@@ well in one house ; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house .
and she ar@@ ose at midnight , and took my son from bes@@ ide me , while th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id sle@@ pt , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
then said the king , The one sa@@ ith , This is my son that li@@ vet@@ h , and TH@@ Y son is the dead : and the other sa@@ ith , N@@ ay ; but TH@@ Y son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and these were the pr@@ inces which he had ; A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est ,
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the host : and Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar were the pri@@ ests :
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Na@@ than was over the officers : and Z@@ ab@@ ud the son of Na@@ than was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
and Ah@@ is@@ har was over the household : and Ad@@ on@@ i@@ ram the son of Ab@@ da was over the tri@@ bute .
the son of D@@ ek@@ ar , in Mak@@ az , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and El@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ han@@ an :
the son of H@@ es@@ ed , in A@@ ru@@ both ; to him per@@ tained So@@ cho@@ h , and all the land of Hep@@ her :
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud ; to him per@@ tained Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean , which is by Z@@ art@@ an@@ ah ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean to A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , even un@@ to the place that is beyond Jok@@ ne@@ am :
Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az was in Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i ; he also took Bas@@ math the daughter of Solomon to wife :
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , in the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel were many , as the s@@ and which is by the sea in multi@@ tude , e@@ ating and drinking , and making mer@@ ry .
and Solomon re@@ ig@@ ned over all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms from the river un@@ to the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and un@@ to the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten f@@ at ox@@ en , and twenty ox@@ en out of the pas@@ tures , and an hundred she@@ ep , bes@@ ide har@@ ts , and ro@@ e@@ bu@@ cks , and f@@ allow@@ de@@ er , and fat@@ ted fo@@ w@@ l .
for he had domin@@ ion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Az@@ z@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel d@@ wel@@ t saf@@ ely , every man under his v@@ ine and under his fi@@ g tree , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , all the days of Solomon .
and those officers provided vic@@ tual for king Solomon , and for all that came un@@ to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month : they la@@ cked nothing .
and God gave Solomon wis@@ dom and understanding exceeding much , and lar@@ gen@@ ess of heart , even as the s@@ and that is on the sea shore .
and Solomon 's wis@@ dom exc@@ elled the wis@@ dom of all the children of the east country , and all the wis@@ dom of Egypt .
for he was wis@@ er than all men ; than E@@ than the E@@ z@@ rah@@ ite , and H@@ eman , and Chal@@ col , and Dar@@ da , the sons of Ma@@ hol : and his f@@ ame was in all nations round about .
and he sp@@ ake three thousand Pro@@ ver@@ bs : and his songs were a thousand and five .
and H@@ i@@ ram king of T@@ y@@ re sent his servants un@@ to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted him king in the room of his father : for H@@ i@@ ram was ever a l@@ over of David .
and Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of p@@ ure oil : thus gave Solomon to H@@ i@@ ram year by year .
and the Lord gave Solomon wis@@ dom , as he promised him : and there was peace between H@@ i@@ ram and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
and king Solomon raised a lev@@ y out of all Israel ; and the lev@@ y was thirty thousand men .
and he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Ad@@ on@@ i@@ ram was over the lev@@ y .
bes@@ ide the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and the king comman@@ ded , and they brought great stones , costly stones , and he@@ wed stones , to lay the foundation of the house .
and Solomon 's buil@@ ders and H@@ i@@ ram 's buil@@ ders did he@@ w them , and the st@@ on@@ es@@ quar@@ ers : so they prepared tim@@ ber and stones to build the house .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length there@@ of was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length there@@ of , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house ; and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built ch@@ ambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle : and he made ch@@ ambers round about :
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with be@@ ams and boards of c@@ ed@@ ar .
and I will d@@ well among the children of Israel , and will not for@@ sake my people Israel .
and the house , that is , the temp@@ le before it , was for@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long .
and the c@@ ed@@ ar of the house within was car@@ ved with k@@ n@@ ops and open flowers : all was c@@ ed@@ ar ; there was no stone seen .
and the or@@ acle he prepared in the house within , to set there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in the he@@ ight there@@ of : and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold ; and so covered the alt@@ ar which was of c@@ ed@@ ar .
so Solomon over@@ laid the house within with p@@ ure gold : and he made a partition by the cha@@ ins of gold before the or@@ acle ; and he over@@ laid it with gold .
and the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole alt@@ ar that was by the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
the he@@ ight of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and so was it of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
and he car@@ ved all the walls of the house round about with car@@ ved figures of ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees and open flowers , within and without .
and for the entering of the or@@ acle he made doors of olive tree : the lin@@ tel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid , in the month Z@@ if :
and it was covered with c@@ ed@@ ar above upon the be@@ ams , that lay on for@@ ty five pil@@ lars , fif@@ teen in a row .
and there were windows in three ro@@ ws , and light was against light in three ranks .
and he made a por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pil@@ lars and the th@@ ick be@@ am were before them .
then he made a por@@ ch for the th@@ r@@ one where he might judge , even the por@@ ch of judgment : and it was covered with c@@ ed@@ ar from one side of the floor to the other .
and his house where he d@@ wel@@ t had another court within the por@@ ch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like un@@ to this por@@ ch .
and the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and stones of eight cu@@ bi@@ ts .
for he cast two pil@@ lars of br@@ ass , of E@@ igh@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts high ap@@ i@@ ece : and a line of twelve cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass either of them about .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set upon the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts :
and n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one chap@@ iter , and seven for the other chap@@ iter .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the top of the pil@@ lars were of L@@ ily work in the por@@ ch , four cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers upon the two pil@@ lars had po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates also above , over against the bel@@ ly which was by the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred in ro@@ ws round about upon the other chap@@ iter .
and he set up the pil@@ lars in the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called the name there@@ of J@@ ach@@ in : and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and he called the name there@@ of Bo@@ az .
and upon the top of the pil@@ lars was L@@ ily work : so was the work of the pil@@ lars finished .
and he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and it was an hand b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick , and the bri@@ m there@@ of was w@@ rought like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies : it contained two thousand ba@@ ths .
and he made ten bases of br@@ ass ; four cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length of one base , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight of it .
and the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the led@@ ges :
and every base had four br@@ as@@ en whe@@ els , and plates of br@@ ass : and the four cor@@ ners there@@ of had under@@ set@@ ters : under the lav@@ er were under@@ set@@ ters m@@ ol@@ ten , at the side of every addition .
and under the borders were four whe@@ els ; and the ax@@ let@@ re@@ es of the whe@@ els were joined to the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and a half a cu@@ bit .
and the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ let@@ re@@ es , and their nav@@ es , and their fel@@ lo@@ es , and their spok@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
and there were four under@@ set@@ ters to the four cor@@ ners of one base : and the under@@ set@@ ters were of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass of half a cu@@ bit high : and on the top of the base the led@@ ges there@@ of and the borders there@@ of were of the same .
for on the plates of the led@@ ges there@@ of , and on the borders there@@ of , he gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the pro@@ portion of every one , and addi@@ tions round about .
after this manner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
then made he ten la@@ vers of br@@ ass : one lav@@ er contained for@@ ty ba@@ ths : and every lav@@ er was four cu@@ bi@@ ts : and upon every one of the ten bases one lav@@ er .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard over against the south .
and H@@ i@@ ram made the la@@ vers , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . so H@@ i@@ ram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord :
and four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks , even two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for one network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the pil@@ lars ;
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons : and all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright br@@ ass .
in the pla@@ in of Jordan did the king cast them , in the cla@@ y ground between Suc@@ co@@ th and Zar@@ than .
and Solomon left all the vessels un@@ weighed , because they were exceeding many : neither was the weight of the br@@ ass found out .
and Solomon made all the vessels that per@@ tained un@@ to the house of the Lord : the alt@@ ar of gold , and the table of gold , where@@ upon the she@@ w@@ bread was ,
and all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves un@@ to king Solomon at the feast in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even those did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and ox@@ en , that could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
for the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread forth their two w@@ ings over the place of the Ar@@ k , and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms covered the Ar@@ k and the st@@ aves there@@ of above .
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are un@@ to this day .
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister because of the cl@@ oud : for the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
I have su@@ rely built the@@ e an house to d@@ well in , a settled place for the@@ e to abide in for ever .
and the king turned his face about , and b@@ les@@ sed all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel : ( and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , which sp@@ ake with his m@@ outh un@@ to David my father , and hat@@ h with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
and it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and the Lord said un@@ to David my father , whereas it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house un@@ to my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well that it was in th@@ ine heart .
nevertheless th@@ ou s@@ halt not build the house ; but TH@@ Y son that shall come forth out of TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , he shall build the house un@@ to my name .
and I have set there a place for the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the alt@@ ar of the Lord in the presence of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heav@@ en :
who h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that th@@ ou promis@@ ed@@ st him : th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est also with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let TH@@ Y word , I pra@@ y the@@ e , be ver@@ ified , which th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father .
but will God indeed d@@ well on the ear@@ th ? be@@ hold , the heav@@ en and heav@@ en of heav@@ ens can@@ not contain the@@ e ; how much less this house that I have buil@@ ded ?
yet have th@@ ou respect un@@ to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and to the pray@@ er , which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e to day :
if any man t@@ res@@ pass against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swe@@ ar , and the oath come before th@@ ine alt@@ ar in this house :
when TH@@ Y people Israel be s@@ mit@@ ten down before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e , and shall turn again to the@@ e , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and pra@@ y , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the@@ e in this house :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y people Israel , and bring them again un@@ to the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers .
when heav@@ en is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and turn from their sin , when th@@ ou aff@@ lic@@ test them :
that they may fear the@@ e all the days that they live in the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
moreover concerning a st@@ ran@@ ger , that is not of TH@@ Y people Israel , but co@@ me@@ th out of a far country for TH@@ Y name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of TH@@ Y great name , and of TH@@ Y strong hand , and of TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to battle against their enemy , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and shall pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for TH@@ Y name :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en their pray@@ er and their supp@@ lic@@ ation , and maintain their cause .
and for@@ give TH@@ Y people that have sin@@ ned against the@@ e and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions where@@ in they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against the@@ e , and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before them who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them :
for they be TH@@ Y people , and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test forth out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y people Israel , to he@@ arken un@@ to them in all that they call for un@@ to the@@ e .
and he stood , and b@@ les@@ sed all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel with a l@@ oud voice , saying ,
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , that hat@@ h given rest un@@ to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hat@@ h not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
the Lord our God be with us , as he was with our fa@@ thers : let him not leave us , nor for@@ sake us :
that all the people of the ear@@ th may know that the Lord is God , and that there is none else .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God , to walk in his stat@@ utes , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , as at this day .
and the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time , as he had appeared un@@ to him at Gi@@ be@@ on .
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David TH@@ Y father , saying , There shall not fail the@@ e a man upon the th@@ r@@ one of Israel .
and at this house , which is high , every one that pass@@ eth by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and H@@ i@@ ram came out from T@@ y@@ re to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present un@@ to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the people that were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , H@@ itti@@ tes , Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , upon those did Solomon lev@@ y a tri@@ bute of bon@@ d@@ service un@@ to this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bon@@ d@@ men : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fif@@ ty , which b@@ are rule over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter came up out of the city of David un@@ to her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Mil@@ lo .
and king Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
and H@@ i@@ ram sent in the nav@@ y his servants , ship@@ men that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and they came to Op@@ hir , and f@@ et@@ ched from th@@ ence gold , four hundred and twenty tal@@ ents , and brought it to king Solomon .
and when the qu@@ een of She@@ ba heard of the f@@ ame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord , she came to prove him with hard questions .
and Solomon told her all her questions : there was not any thing hi@@ d from the king , which he told her not .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , be@@ hold , the half was not told me : TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and prosperity exce@@ ede@@ th the f@@ ame which I heard .
happy are TH@@ Y men , happy are these TH@@ Y servants , which stand continu@@ ally before the@@ e , and that hear TH@@ Y wis@@ dom .
and the nav@@ y also of H@@ i@@ ram , that brought gold from Op@@ hir , brought in from Op@@ hir great plenty of al@@ mu@@ g trees , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred thre@@ es@@ core and six tal@@ ents of gold .
bes@@ ide that he had of the mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men , and of the traffic@@ k of the sp@@ ice mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
moreover the king made a great th@@ r@@ one of Iv@@ ory , and over@@ laid it with the best gold .
the th@@ r@@ one had six steps , and the top of the th@@ r@@ one was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons stood bes@@ ide the stays .
and twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and all the ear@@ th sought to Solomon , to hear his wis@@ dom , which God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and gar@@ ments , and arm@@ our , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
and the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that are in the val@@ e , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
and Solomon had hor@@ ses brought out of Egypt , and lin@@ en yar@@ n : the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received the lin@@ en yar@@ n at a price .
but king Solomon lov@@ ed many st@@ range women , together with the daughter of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , women of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , Am@@ mon@@ ites , E@@ dom@@ ites , Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and H@@ itti@@ tes ;
for Solomon went after Ash@@ to@@ re@@ th the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss of the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and after Mil@@ com the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the Am@@ mon@@ ites .
and Solomon did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and went not fully after the Lord , as did David his father .
then did Solomon build an high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , in the hill that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing in TH@@ Y days I will not do it for David TH@@ Y father 's sake : but I will ren@@ d it out of the hand of TH@@ Y son .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I will not ren@@ d away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but will give one tri@@ be to TH@@ Y son for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up an ad@@ versary un@@ to Solomon , Had@@ ad the E@@ dom@@ ite : he was of the king 's se@@ ed in E@@ dom .
for it came to pass , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , after he had s@@ mit@@ ten every male in E@@ dom ;
( for six months did Jo@@ a@@ b remain there with all Israel , until he had cut off every male in E@@ dom : )
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
and Had@@ ad found great favour in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the qu@@ een .
and the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es b@@ are him Gen@@ ub@@ ath his son , whom Tah@@ pen@@ es we@@ an@@ ed in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house : and Gen@@ ub@@ ath was in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's household among the sons of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Let me de@@ part , that I may go to mine own country .
and God s@@ tir@@ red him up another ad@@ versary , Re@@ z@@ on the son of Eli@@ ad@@ ah , which fled from his lor@@ d Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah :
and he gathered men un@@ to him , and became captain over a band , when David sle@@ w them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Dam@@ as@@ cus , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in , and re@@ ig@@ ned in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and he was an ad@@ versary to Israel all the days of Solomon , bes@@ ide the mis@@ chief that Had@@ ad did : and he ab@@ hor@@ red Israel , and re@@ ig@@ ned over Syria .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of Zer@@ eda , Solomon 's ser@@ vant , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a wi@@ dow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Mil@@ lo , and rep@@ aired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ our : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industri@@ ous , he made him ru@@ ler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and A@@ hij@@ ah caught the new gar@@ ment that was on him , and rent it in twelve pieces :
and he said to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , T@@ ake the@@ e ten pieces : for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , I will ren@@ d the k@@ ing@@ dom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tri@@ bes to the@@ e :
( but he shall have one tri@@ be for my ser@@ vant David 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel : )
but I will take the k@@ ing@@ dom out of his son 's hand , and will give it un@@ to the@@ e , even ten tri@@ bes .
and un@@ to his son will I give one tri@@ be , that David my ser@@ vant may have a light al@@ way before me in Jer@@ usalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
and I will take the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt reign according to all that TH@@ Y sou@@ l desi@@ re@@ th , and s@@ halt be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am . and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ar@@ ose , and fled into Egypt , un@@ to S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and the time that Solomon re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem over all Israel was for@@ ty years .
and Solomon sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt ; )
that they sent and called him . and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel came , and sp@@ ake un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am consul@@ ted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , Ho@@ w do ye advis@@ e that I may answer this people ?
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men , which they had given him , and consul@@ ted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said un@@ to them , What coun@@ sel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Mak@@ e the yok@@ e which TH@@ Y father did put upon us ligh@@ ter ?
and now whereas my father did la@@ de you with a heavy yok@@ e , I will add to your yok@@ e : my father hat@@ h ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed you with w@@ hi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord sp@@ ake by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite un@@ to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
but as for the children of Israel which d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned over them .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tri@@ bute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and he set the one in Be@@ the@@ l , and the other put he in Dan .
and this thing became a sin : for the people went to worship before the one , even un@@ to Dan .
and he made an house of high places , and made pri@@ ests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of L@@ evi .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man of God out of Ju@@ da@@ h by the word of the Lord un@@ to Be@@ the@@ l : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am stood by the alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se .
the alt@@ ar also was rent , and the ashes p@@ oured out from the alt@@ ar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
and he said , I may not return with the@@ e , nor go in with the@@ e : neither will I eat bread nor drink water with the@@ e in this place :
for it was said to me by the word of the Lord , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
so he went back with him , and did eat bread in his house , and d@@ rank water .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t that brought him back :
and it came to pass , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led for him the ass , to w@@ it , for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t d@@ wel@@ t .
and the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old pro@@ phe@@ t came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bur@@ y him .
and he laid his car@@ case in his own grave ; and they mour@@ ned over him , saying , A@@ las , my brother !
and this thing became sin un@@ to the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and take with the@@ e ten lo@@ aves , and crack@@ n@@ els , and a cr@@ use of hon@@ ey , and go to him : he shall tell the@@ e what shall become of the child .
him that di@@ eth of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
arise th@@ ou therefore , get the@@ e to th@@ ine own house : and when TH@@ Y feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
and he shall give Israel up because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
and they buried him ; and all Israel mour@@ ned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of his ser@@ vant A@@ hij@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t .
and the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and the days which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned were two and twenty years : and he sle@@ pt with this fa@@ thers , and Nad@@ a@@ b his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and Ju@@ da@@ h did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they had committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and there were also so@@ dom@@ ites in the land : and they did according to all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , that S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem :
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their stead br@@ as@@ en shi@@ elds , and committed them un@@ to the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard b@@ are them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
three years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Ab@@ is@@ hal@@ om .
and he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the Lord his God give him a lam@@ p in Jer@@ usalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jer@@ usalem :
now the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and A@@ SA his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and for@@ ty and one years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Ab@@ is@@ hal@@ om .
and A@@ SA did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , as did David his father .
but the high places were not removed : nevertheless A@@ SA 's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel went up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and it came to pass , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard there@@ of , that he left off building of Ram@@ ah , and d@@ wel@@ t in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and Nad@@ a@@ b the son of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am began to reign over Israel in the second year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel two years .
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha smo@@ te him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel laid siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
even in the third year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h did Ba@@ as@@ ha s@@ lay him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provoc@@ ation where@@ with he provoked the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
in the third year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah to reign over all Israel in Tir@@ z@@ ah , twenty and four years .
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
then the word of the Lord came to J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani against Ba@@ as@@ ha , saying ,
be@@ hold , I will take away the poster@@ ity of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and the poster@@ ity of his house ; and will make TH@@ Y house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
him that di@@ eth of Ba@@ as@@ ha in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth of his in the fields shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
so Ba@@ as@@ ha sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in Tir@@ z@@ ah : and E@@ lah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
in the twenty and sixth year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began E@@ lah the son of Ba@@ as@@ ha to reign over Israel in Tir@@ z@@ ah , two years .
and his ser@@ vant Z@@ im@@ ri , captain of half his char@@ i@@ ots , consp@@ ired against him , as he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the house of Ar@@ za ste@@ ward of his house in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and Z@@ im@@ ri went in and smo@@ te him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty and seventh year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h did Z@@ im@@ ri reign seven days in Tir@@ z@@ ah . and the people were en@@ camp@@ ed against G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the people that were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri hat@@ h consp@@ ired , and hat@@ h also sla@@ in the king : where@@ fore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and Om@@ ri went up from G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , and all Israel with him , and they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and it came to pass , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he w@@ rought , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
but the people that followed Om@@ ri prev@@ ailed against the people that followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath : so Ti@@ b@@ ni died , and Om@@ ri re@@ ig@@ ned .
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he she@@ wed , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
so Om@@ ri sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in Samar@@ ia : and A@@ ha@@ b his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up an alt@@ ar for Ba@@ al in the house of Ba@@ al , which he had built in Samar@@ ia .
and A@@ ha@@ b made a gro@@ ve ; and A@@ ha@@ b did more to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
get the@@ e hence , and turn the@@ e eas@@ tw@@ ard , and hide th@@ y@@ self by the Bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before Jordan .
and it shall be , that th@@ ou s@@ halt drink of the Bro@@ ok ; and I have comman@@ ded the ra@@ ven@@ s to fe@@ ed the@@ e there .
so he went and did according un@@ to the word of the Lord : for he went and d@@ wel@@ t by the Bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before Jordan .
and the ra@@ ven@@ s brought him bread and f@@ les@@ h in the morning , and bread and f@@ les@@ h in the evening ; and he d@@ rank of the Bro@@ ok .
and it came to pass after a while , that the Bro@@ ok dri@@ ed up , because there had been no rain in the land .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying ,
and as she was going to f@@ et@@ ch it , he called to her , and said , Br@@ ing me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a mor@@ sel of bread in th@@ ine hand .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah said un@@ to her , Fe@@ ar not ; go and do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said : but make me there@@ of a little c@@ ake first , and bring it un@@ to me , and after make for the@@ e and for TH@@ Y son .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , The bar@@ rel of me@@ al shall not waste , neither shall the cr@@ use of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sen@@ de@@ th rain upon the ear@@ th .
and she went and did according to the saying of Eli@@ j@@ ah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
and the bar@@ rel of me@@ al was@@ ted not , neither did the cr@@ use of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , h@@ ast th@@ ou also brought ev@@ il upon the wi@@ dow with whom I so@@ jour@@ n , by s@@ lay@@ ing her son ?
and he stret@@ ched himself upon the child three times , and cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let this child 's sou@@ l come into him again .
and the Lord heard the voice of Eli@@ j@@ ah ; and the sou@@ l of the child came into him again , and he revi@@ ved .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him un@@ to his mother : and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , Se@@ e , TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h .
and it came to pass after many days , that the word of the Lord came to Eli@@ j@@ ah in the third year , saying , G@@ o , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b ; and I will send rain upon the ear@@ th .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah went to she@@ w himself un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b . and there was a sor@@ e fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia .
and A@@ ha@@ b called Ob@@ adi@@ ah , which was the governor of his house . ( now Ob@@ adi@@ ah fear@@ ed the Lord greatly :
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took an hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : A@@ ha@@ b went one way by himself , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah went another way by himself .
and as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , be@@ hold , Eli@@ j@@ ah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art th@@ ou that my lor@@ d Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
so A@@ ha@@ b sent un@@ to all the children of Israel , and gathered the pro@@ ph@@ ets together un@@ to mount Car@@ mel .
then said Eli@@ j@@ ah un@@ to the people , I , even I only , remain a pro@@ phe@@ t of the Lord ; but Ba@@ al 's pro@@ ph@@ ets are four hundred and fif@@ ty men .
and they cri@@ ed al@@ oud , and cut themselves after their manner with k@@ ni@@ ves and lan@@ c@@ ets , ti@@ ll the blood gus@@ hed out upon them .
and it came to pass , when mid@@ day was past , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , C@@ ome near un@@ to me . and all the people came near un@@ to him . and he rep@@ aired the alt@@ ar of the Lord that was broken down .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , un@@ to whom the word of the Lord came , saying , Israel shall be TH@@ Y name :
and with the stones he built an alt@@ ar in the name of the Lord : and he made a tren@@ ch about the alt@@ ar , as great as would contain two measures of se@@ ed .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ lock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and on the wood .
and the water ran round about the alt@@ ar ; and he filled the tren@@ ch also with water .
then the fire of the Lord fell , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the d@@ ust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the tren@@ ch .
and when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The Lord , he is the God ; the Lord , he is the God .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah said un@@ to them , T@@ ake the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Ba@@ al ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Eli@@ j@@ ah brought them down to the Bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and sle@@ w them there .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he cast himself down upon the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es ,
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heav@@ en was black with cl@@ ou@@ ds and wind , and there was a great rain . and A@@ ha@@ b ro@@ de , and went to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and the hand of the Lord was on Eli@@ j@@ ah ; and he gir@@ ded up his lo@@ ins , and ran before A@@ ha@@ b to the entrance of J@@ ez@@ reel .
and A@@ ha@@ b told J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel all that Eli@@ j@@ ah had done , and with@@ al how he had sla@@ in all the pro@@ ph@@ ets with the s@@ word .
and when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
and he looked , and , be@@ hold , there was a c@@ ake bak@@ en on the co@@ als , and a cr@@ use of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord came again the second time , and touched him , and said , arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for the@@ e .
and he ar@@ ose , and did eat and drink , and went in the strength of that meat for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights un@@ to Ho@@ re@@ b the mount of God .
and it shall come to pass , that him that escap@@ eth the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el shall J@@ eh@@ u s@@ lay : and him that escap@@ eth from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u shall E@@ lis@@ ha s@@ lay .
yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the k@@ ne@@ es which have not bo@@ wed un@@ to Ba@@ al , and every m@@ outh which hat@@ h not k@@ is@@ sed him .
and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel into the city , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad ,
then he num@@ ber@@ ed the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them he num@@ ber@@ ed all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
and they went out at noon . but Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad was drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the pav@@ ili@@ ons , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
and the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces went out first ; and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samar@@ ia .
so these young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
and they sle@@ w every one his man : and the Syri@@ ans fled ; and Israel pursu@@ ed them : and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the king of Syria escaped on an hor@@ se with the hor@@ se@@ men .
and the king of Israel went out , and smo@@ te the hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots , and sle@@ w the Syri@@ ans with a great sla@@ ughter .
and do this thing , T@@ ake the kings away , every man out of his place , and put cap@@ tains in their rooms :
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad num@@ ber@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
and they pit@@ ched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans an hundred thousand foot@@ men in one day .
and a certain man of the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets said un@@ to his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Sm@@ ite me , I pra@@ y the@@ e . and the man refused to sm@@ ite him .
so the pro@@ phe@@ t depar@@ ted , and w@@ aited for the king by the way , and dis@@ gu@@ ised himself with ashes upon his face .
and as TH@@ Y ser@@ vant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of Israel said un@@ to him , S@@ o shall TH@@ Y judgment be ; th@@ y@@ self h@@ ast decided it .
and he has@@ ted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel dis@@ cer@@ ned him that he was of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and the king of Israel went to his house heavy and disp@@ le@@ ased , and came to Samar@@ ia .
and J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel his wife said un@@ to him , D@@ ost th@@ ou now govern the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let th@@ ine heart be mer@@ ry : I will give the@@ e the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite .
and set two men , sons of Bel@@ ial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent un@@ to them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent un@@ to them .
they proclaimed a fast , and set Nab@@ o@@ th on high among the people .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
arise , go down to meet A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , which is in Samar@@ ia : be@@ hold , he is in the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th , w@@ hi@@ ther he is gone down to poss@@ ess it .
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provoc@@ ation where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast provoked me to an@@ ger , and made Israel to sin .
him that di@@ eth of A@@ ha@@ b in the city the do@@ gs shall eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .
but there was none like un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b , which did sell himself to work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord , whom J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel his wife s@@ tir@@ red up .
and he did very ab@@ omin@@ ably in following id@@ ols , according to all things as did the Am@@ ori@@ tes , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard those words , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th upon his f@@ les@@ h , and fas@@ ted , and lay in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went sof@@ tly .
and it came to pass in the third year , that J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h came down to the king of Israel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said un@@ to the king of Israel , inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , having put on their rob@@ es , in a vo@@ id place in the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and he said , He@@ ar th@@ ou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his th@@ r@@ one , and all the host of heav@@ en standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h put a lying spirit in the m@@ outh of all these TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the Lord hat@@ h spoken ev@@ il concerning the@@ e .
but Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah went near , and smo@@ te Mic@@ ai@@ ah on the che@@ ek , and said , Wh@@ ich way went the Spiri@@ t of the Lord from me to speak un@@ to the@@ e ?
and Mic@@ ai@@ ah said , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt see in that day , when th@@ ou s@@ halt go into an in@@ ner chamber to hide th@@ y@@ self .
and the king of Israel said , T@@ ake Mic@@ ai@@ ah , and carry him back un@@ to Am@@ on the governor of the city , and to Jo@@ ash the king 's son ;
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and fe@@ ed him with bread of aff@@ li@@ ction and with water of aff@@ li@@ ction , until I come in peace .
but the king of Syria comman@@ ded his thirty and two cap@@ tains that had rule over his char@@ i@@ ots , saying , F@@ ight neither with small nor great , save only with the king of Israel .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and there went a proc@@ lamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
so the king died , and was brought to Samar@@ ia ; and they buried the king in Samar@@ ia .
and one was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot in the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they was@@ hed his arm@@ our ; according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake .
so A@@ ha@@ b sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of A@@ SA began to reign over Ju@@ da@@ h in the fourth year of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he she@@ wed , and how he war@@ red , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at made ships of T@@ har@@ sh@@ ish to go to Op@@ hir for gold : but they went not ; for the ships were broken at E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David his father : and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ ha@@ b began to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th year of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and re@@ ig@@ ned two years over Israel .
for he served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him , and provoked to an@@ ger the Lord God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
and he said un@@ to them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
be@@ hold , there came fire down from heav@@ en , and bur@@ n@@ t up the two cap@@ tains of the former fif@@ ties with their fif@@ ties : therefore let my life now be pre@@ ci@@ ous in TH@@ Y sight .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to Eli@@ j@@ ah , G@@ o down with him : be not afraid of him . and he ar@@ ose , and went down with him un@@ to the king .
so he died according to the word of the Lord which Eli@@ j@@ ah had spoken . and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead in the second year of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when the Lord would take up Eli@@ j@@ ah into heav@@ en by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , that Eli@@ j@@ ah went with E@@ lis@@ ha from G@@ ilg@@ al .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took his man@@ tle , and wrapped it together , and smo@@ te the waters , and they were divided hi@@ ther and th@@ ither , so that they two went over on d@@ ry ground .
he took up also the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah do@@ th rest on E@@ lis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
and when they came again to him , ( for he tar@@ ried at Jer@@ ich@@ o , ) he said un@@ to them , did I not say un@@ to you , G@@ o not ?
so the waters were he@@ aled un@@ to this day , according to the saying of E@@ lis@@ ha which he sp@@ ake .
now J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b began to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and re@@ ig@@ ned twelve years .
nevertheless he cle@@ av@@ ed un@@ to the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ a@@ b was a she@@ ep@@ master , and ren@@ dered un@@ to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and an hundred thousand r@@ ams , with the wo@@ ol .
but it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b was dead , that the king of Mo@@ a@@ b rebel@@ led against the king of Israel .
and E@@ lis@@ ha said , As the Lord of hosts li@@ vet@@ h , before whom I stand , su@@ rely , were it not that I regard the presence of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , I would not look toward the@@ e , nor see the@@ e .
but now bring me a min@@ st@@ rel . and it came to pass , when the min@@ st@@ rel played , that the hand of the Lord came upon him .
and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord : he will deliver the Mo@@ abi@@ tes also into your hand .
and ye shall sm@@ ite every f@@ enced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wel@@ ls of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and when all the Mo@@ abi@@ tes heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on arm@@ our , and up@@ ward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one upon the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and smo@@ te the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them : but they went forward s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , even in their country .
and when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too sor@@ e for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even un@@ to the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then he said , G@@ o , bor@@ row the@@ e vessels abroad of all TH@@ Y neighbours , even empty vessels ; bor@@ row not a few .
and when th@@ ou art come in , th@@ ou s@@ halt shut the door upon the@@ e and upon TH@@ Y sons , and s@@ halt p@@ our out into all those vessels , and th@@ ou s@@ halt set aside that which is full .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she p@@ oured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came th@@ ither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and the woman conce@@ ived , and b@@ are a son at that season that E@@ lis@@ ha had said un@@ to her , according to the time of life .
and when the child was grown , it fell on a day , that he went out to his father to the re@@ apers .
and when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her k@@ ne@@ es ti@@ ll noon , and then died .
and she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door upon him , and went out .
then she s@@ add@@ led an ass , and said to her ser@@ vant , D@@ ri@@ ve , and go forward ; S@@ lack not TH@@ Y ri@@ ding for me , except I bid the@@ e .
and the mother of the child said , As the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , and as TH@@ Y sou@@ l li@@ vet@@ h , I will not leave the@@ e . and he ar@@ ose , and followed her .
and when E@@ lis@@ ha was come into the house , be@@ hold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them tw@@ ain , and pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and f@@ ro ; and went up , and stret@@ ched himself upon him : and the child s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and one went out into the field to gather her@@ bs , and found a wild v@@ ine , and gathered there@@ of wild go@@ ur@@ ds his la@@ p full , and came and sh@@ red them into the po@@ t of po@@ tt@@ age : for they knew them not .
and the Syri@@ ans had gone out by companies , and had brought away cap@@ tive out of the land of Israel a little ma@@ id ; and she w@@ aited on Na@@ aman 's wife .
and one went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , Th@@ us and thus said the ma@@ id that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come un@@ to the@@ e , be@@ hold , I have there@@ with sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to the@@ e , that th@@ ou may@@ est rec@@ over him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
so Na@@ aman came with his hor@@ ses and with his char@@ i@@ ot , and stood at the door of the house of E@@ lis@@ ha .
and E@@ lis@@ ha sent a mes@@ sen@@ ger un@@ to him , saying , G@@ o and was@@ h in the Jordan seven times , and TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h shall come again to the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be clean .
are not A@@ bana and P@@ har@@ p@@ ar , rivers of Dam@@ as@@ cus , better than all the waters of Israel ? May I not was@@ h in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a ra@@ ge .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his f@@ les@@ h came again like un@@ to the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the to@@ wer , he took them from their hand , and bes@@ to@@ wed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets said un@@ to E@@ lis@@ ha , be@@ hold now , the place where we d@@ well with the@@ e is too stra@@ it for us .
then the king of Syria war@@ red against Israel , and took coun@@ sel with his servants , saying , In such and such a place shall be my camp .
and the man of God sent un@@ to the king of Israel , saying , be@@ w@@ are that th@@ ou pass not such a place ; for th@@ ither the Syri@@ ans are come down .
and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of , and sav@@ ed himself there , not once nor twice .
and he said , G@@ o and sp@@ y where he is , that I may send and f@@ et@@ ch him . and it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , he is in Do@@ than .
therefore sent he th@@ ither hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots , and a great host : and they came by night , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the city about .
and when they came down to him , E@@ lis@@ ha pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , Sm@@ ite this people , I pra@@ y the@@ e , with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness . and he smo@@ te them with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness according to the word of E@@ lis@@ ha .
and the king of Israel said un@@ to E@@ lis@@ ha , when he saw them , My father , shall I sm@@ ite them ? shall I sm@@ ite them ?
and it came to pass after this , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Samar@@ ia .
and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall , there cri@@ ed a woman un@@ to him , saying , Hel@@ p , my lor@@ d , O king .
and the king said un@@ to her , What ail@@ eth the@@ e ? and she answ@@ ered , This woman said un@@ to me , Gi@@ ve TH@@ Y son , that we may eat him to day , and we will eat my son to mor@@ row .
and they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go un@@ to the camp of the Syri@@ ans : and when they were come to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore they ar@@ ose and fled in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and left their ten@@ ts , and their hor@@ ses , and their ass@@ es , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and he called the por@@ ters ; and they told it to the king 's house within .
and they went after them un@@ to Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . and the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
and so it fell out un@@ to him : for the people tro@@ de upon him in the gate , and he died .
and the woman ar@@ ose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
and the king talked with Ge@@ hazi the ser@@ vant of the man of God , saying , T@@ ell me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , all the great things that E@@ lis@@ ha hat@@ h done .
and the king said un@@ to Haz@@ a@@ el , T@@ ake a present in th@@ ine hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inqu@@ ire of the Lord by him , saying , shall I rec@@ over of this disease ?
and in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being then king of Ju@@ da@@ h , J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eight years in Jer@@ usalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b was his wife : and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
yet the Lord would not destroy Ju@@ da@@ h for David his ser@@ vant 's sake , as he promised him to give him al@@ way a light , and to his children .
in his days E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made a king over themselves .
so Jor@@ am went over to Z@@ air , and all the char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ ass@@ ed him about , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots : and the people fled into their ten@@ ts .
yet E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to this day . then Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ ted at the same time .
and the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and Jor@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
in the twel@@ f@@ th year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel did A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah , the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he was the son in law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and he went with Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b to the war against Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria in Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ; and the Syri@@ ans wounded Jor@@ am .
and E@@ lis@@ ha the pro@@ phe@@ t called one of the children of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and said un@@ to him , Gir@@ d up TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , and take this box of oil in th@@ ine hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad :
and when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st th@@ ither , look out there J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his bre@@ th@@ ren , and carry him to an in@@ ner chamber ;
so the young man , even the young man the pro@@ phe@@ t , went to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ ha@@ b TH@@ Y master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish : and I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and I will make the house of A@@ ha@@ b like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah :
and the do@@ gs shall eat J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel in the portion of J@@ ez@@ reel , and there shall be none to bur@@ y her . and he opened the door , and fled .
then they has@@ ted , and took every man his gar@@ ment , and put it under him on the top of the st@@ airs , and ble@@ w with tr@@ ump@@ ets , saying , J@@ eh@@ u is king .
so J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i consp@@ ired against Jor@@ am . ( now Jor@@ am had kept Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , he and all Israel , because of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria .
so J@@ eh@@ u ro@@ de in a char@@ i@@ ot , and went to J@@ ez@@ reel ; for Jor@@ am lay there . and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h was come down to see Jor@@ am .
and the watch@@ man told , saying , He came even un@@ to them , and co@@ me@@ th not again : and the driving is like the driving of J@@ eh@@ u the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i ; for he dri@@ vet@@ h fur@@ iously .
and J@@ eh@@ u drew a bo@@ w with his full strength , and smo@@ te J@@ eh@@ or@@ am between his arms , and the ar@@ row went out at his heart , and he sun@@ k down in his char@@ i@@ ot .
and in the ele@@ venth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b began A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah to reign over Ju@@ da@@ h .
and when J@@ eh@@ u was come to J@@ ez@@ reel , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard of it ; and she pain@@ ted her face , and ti@@ red her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Wh@@ o is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s .
and he said , throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on the wall , and on the hor@@ ses : and he tro@@ de her under fo@@ ot .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , G@@ o , see now this Cur@@ sed woman , and bur@@ y her : for she is a king 's daughter .
and they went to bur@@ y her : but they found no more of her than the s@@ kul@@ l , and the feet , and the pal@@ ms of her hands .
and the car@@ case of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel shall be as D@@ ung upon the face of the field in the portion of J@@ ez@@ reel ; so that they shall not say , This is J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and A@@ ha@@ b had sev@@ enty sons in Samar@@ ia . and J@@ eh@@ u wrote letters , and sent to Samar@@ ia , un@@ to the rul@@ ers of J@@ ez@@ reel , to the el@@ ders , and to them that brought up A@@ ha@@ b 's children , saying ,
now as soon as this letter co@@ me@@ th to you , seeing your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ ses , a f@@ enced city also , and arm@@ our ;
look even out the best and me@@ e@@ test of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's th@@ r@@ one , and fight for your master 's house .
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and sle@@ w sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent him them to J@@ ez@@ reel .
know now that there shall fall un@@ to the ear@@ th nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord sp@@ ake concerning the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the Lord hat@@ h done that which he sp@@ ake by his ser@@ vant Eli@@ j@@ ah .
so J@@ eh@@ u sle@@ w all that remained of the house of A@@ ha@@ b in J@@ ez@@ reel , and all his great men , and his k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , and his pri@@ ests , until he left him none remaining .
and he ar@@ ose and depar@@ ted , and came to Samar@@ ia . and as he was at the S@@ hearing house in the way ,
and when he came to Samar@@ ia , he sle@@ w all that remained un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , ti@@ ll he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and they brought forth the images out of the house of Ba@@ al , and burned them .
and they br@@ ake down the image of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake down the house of Ba@@ al , and made it a dra@@ ught house un@@ to this day .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u depar@@ ted not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and J@@ eh@@ u sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers : and they buried him in Samar@@ ia . and Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she ar@@ ose and destroyed all the se@@ ed royal .
and he was with her hi@@ d in the house of the Lord six years . and Ath@@ ali@@ ah did reign over the land .
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall even be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king .
and to the cap@@ tains over hundreds did the pri@@ est give king David 's spe@@ ars and shi@@ elds , that were in the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and when Ath@@ ali@@ ah heard the no@@ ise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the hor@@ ses came into the king 's house : and there was she sla@@ in .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between the Lord and the king and the people that they should be the Lord 's people ; between the king also and the people .
and all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and the city was in quiet : and they sle@@ w Ath@@ ali@@ ah with the s@@ word bes@@ ide the king 's house .
let the pri@@ ests take it to them , every man of his acqu@@ ain@@ tance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever any breach shall be found .
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
and the pri@@ ests consen@@ ted to receive no more money of the people , neither to repair the breaches of the house .
and to mas@@ ons , and he@@ wers of stone , and to buy tim@@ ber and he@@ wed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the Lord bo@@ w@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ons , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
but they gave that to the work@@ men , and rep@@ aired there@@ with the house of the Lord .
moreover they rec@@ kon@@ ed not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bes@@ to@@ wed on work@@ men : for they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully .
the t@@ res@@ pass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the Lord : it was the pri@@ ests ' .
then Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria went up , and fought against G@@ ath , and took it : and Haz@@ a@@ el set his face to go up to Jer@@ usalem .
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and his servants ar@@ ose , and made a con@@ spir@@ acy , and sle@@ w Jo@@ ash in the house of Mil@@ lo , which go@@ eth down to Sil@@ la .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of J@@ eh@@ u began to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned se@@ ven@@ teen years .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a sa@@ vi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syri@@ ans : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their ten@@ ts , as be@@ fore@@ time .
nevertheless they depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , who made Israel sin , but walked there@@ in : and there remained the gro@@ ve also in Samar@@ ia . )
neither did he leave of the people to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz but fif@@ ty hor@@ se@@ men , and ten char@@ i@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the d@@ ust by th@@ res@@ hing .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him in Samar@@ ia : and Jo@@ ash his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
in the thirty and seventh year of Jo@@ ash king of Ju@@ da@@ h began Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years .
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and Jo@@ ash sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am sat upon his th@@ r@@ one : and Jo@@ ash was buried in Samar@@ ia with the kings of Israel .
and he said to the king of Israel , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand upon the bo@@ w . and he put his hand upon it : and E@@ lis@@ ha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and E@@ lis@@ ha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes inv@@ aded the land at the coming in of the year .
in the second year of Jo@@ ash son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz king of Israel re@@ ig@@ ned A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah the son of Jo@@ ash king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father : he did according to all things as Jo@@ ash his father did .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : as yet the people did sacrifice and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se on the high places .
and it came to pass , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was confirmed in his hand , that he sle@@ w his servants which had sla@@ in the king his father .
but A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah would not hear . therefore Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Ju@@ da@@ h was put to the worse before Israel ; and they fled every man to their ten@@ ts .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and host@@ ages , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in Samar@@ ia with the kings of Israel ; and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
now they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem : and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and sle@@ w him there .
and they brought him on hor@@ ses : and he was buried at Jer@@ usalem with his fa@@ thers in the city of David .
and all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , which was six@@ teen years old , and made him king instead of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah the son of Jo@@ ash king of Ju@@ da@@ h Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash king of Israel began to reign in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty and one years .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
for the Lord saw the aff@@ li@@ ction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any hel@@ per for Israel .
and the Lord said not that he would blo@@ t out the name of Israel from under heav@@ en : but he sav@@ ed them by the hand of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash .
in the twenty and seventh year of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am king of Israel began A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah son of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h to reign .
six@@ teen years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two and fif@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ hol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had done ;
save that the high places were not removed : the people sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se still on the high places .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
so A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as his fa@@ thers had done : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h consp@@ ired against him , and smo@@ te him before the people , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake un@@ to J@@ eh@@ u , saying , Th@@ y sons shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel un@@ to the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h began to reign in the nine and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned a full month in Samar@@ ia .
for Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i went up from Tir@@ z@@ ah , and came to Samar@@ ia , and smo@@ te S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h in Samar@@ ia , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .

in the nine and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h began Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i to reign over Israel , and re@@ ig@@ ned ten years in Samar@@ ia .
and P@@ ul the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came against the land : and Men@@ a@@ hem gave P@@ ul a thousand tal@@ ents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the k@@ ing@@ dom in his hand .
and the rest of the acts of Men@@ a@@ hem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
in the fif@@ ti@@ eth year of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h Pek@@ a@@ hi@@ ah the son of Men@@ a@@ hem began to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned two years .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
in the two and fif@@ ti@@ eth year of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah began to reign over Israel in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned twenty years .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a con@@ spir@@ acy against Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
in the second year of Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah king of Israel began Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h to reign .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha , the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : he did according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the high places were not removed : the people sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and burned incen@@ se still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the Lord .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
in those days the Lord began to send against Ju@@ da@@ h Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
and Jo@@ th@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David his father : and A@@ haz his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
in the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th year of Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , ye@@ a , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
and he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the high places , and on the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree .
then Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria and Pek@@ ah son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah king of Israel came up to Jer@@ usalem to war : and they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed A@@ haz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria recovered E@@ la@@ th to Syria , and dra@@ ve the Jews from E@@ la@@ th : and the Syri@@ ans came to E@@ la@@ th , and d@@ wel@@ t there un@@ to this day .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him : for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a went up against Dam@@ as@@ cus , and took it , and carried the people of it cap@@ tive to K@@ ir , and sle@@ w Re@@ z@@ in .
and U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est built an alt@@ ar according to all that king A@@ haz had sent from Dam@@ as@@ cus : so U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est made it against king A@@ haz came from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and when the king was come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king appro@@ ached to the alt@@ ar , and offered there@@ on .
and he bur@@ n@@ t his bur@@ n@@ t offering and his meat offering , and p@@ oured his drink offering , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood of his peace offer@@ ings , upon the alt@@ ar .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , which was before the Lord , from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between the alt@@ ar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the alt@@ ar .
and king A@@ haz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the lav@@ er from off them ; and took down the sea from off the br@@ as@@ en ox@@ en that were under it , and put it upon a pav@@ ement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
against him came up S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and Hos@@ he@@ a became his ser@@ vant , and gave him presents .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it three years .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secre@@ tly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
and there they bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in all the high places , as did the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord carried away before them ; and w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ ked things to prov@@ oke the Lord to an@@ ger :
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they would not hear , but har@@ dened their nec@@ ks , like to the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
and they left all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made a gro@@ ve , and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served Ba@@ al .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
also Ju@@ da@@ h kept not the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord their God , but walked in the stat@@ utes of Israel which they made .
and the Lord rejected all the se@@ ed of Israel , and aff@@ lic@@ ted them , and delivered them into the hand of sp@@ o@@ ilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at king : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am dra@@ ve Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin .
for the children of Israel walked in all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he did ; they depar@@ ted not from them ;
until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a un@@ to this day .
and so it was at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they fear@@ ed not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent li@@ ons among them , which sle@@ w some of them .
then one of the pri@@ ests whom they had carried away from Samar@@ ia came and d@@ wel@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l , and ta@@ ught them how they should fear the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it every nation made go@@ ds of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities where@@ in they d@@ wel@@ t .
and the men of Bab@@ yl@@ on made Suc@@ co@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ben@@ o@@ th , and the men of C@@ ut@@ h made Ner@@ gal , and the men of Ham@@ ath made Ash@@ ima ,
so they fear@@ ed the Lord , and made un@@ to themselves of the lowest of them pri@@ ests of the high places , which sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for them in the houses of the high places .
they fear@@ ed the Lord , and served their own go@@ ds , after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from th@@ ence .
with whom the Lord had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and charged them saying , Y@@ e shall not fear other go@@ ds , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them :
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stret@@ ched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I have made with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other go@@ ds .
but the Lord your God ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enem@@ ies .
so these nations fear@@ ed the Lord , and served their Gra@@ ven images , both their children , and their children 's children : as did their fa@@ thers , so do they un@@ to this day .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was A@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did .
he tr@@ usted in the Lord God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor any that were before him .
for he cla@@ ve to the Lord , and depar@@ ted not from following him , but kept his comman@@ d@@ ments , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the Lord was with him ; and he prosp@@ ered w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went forth : and he rebel@@ led against the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and served him not .
he smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , even un@@ to Gaza , and the borders there@@ of , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a did carry away Israel un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des :
because they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord their God , but trans@@ g@@ ressed his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and all that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
now in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah did Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a come up against all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and took them .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temp@@ le of the Lord , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order .
and Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h said un@@ to them , Spe@@ ak ye now to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , What confidence is this where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test ?
T@@ ho@@ u say@@ est , ( but they are but v@@ ain words , ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for the war . now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give pledges to my lor@@ d the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will deliver the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h stood and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a :
thus sa@@ ith the king , Let not H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah dec@@ e@@ ive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand :
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
H@@ ath any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
where are the go@@ ds of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ p@@ ad ? where are the go@@ ds of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , H@@ ena , and Iv@@ ah ? have they delivered Samar@@ ia out of mine hand ?
who are they among all the go@@ ds of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the Lord should deliver Jer@@ usalem out of mine hand ?
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
so Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h returned , and found the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a war@@ ring against Lib@@ n@@ ah : for he had heard that he was depar@@ ted from L@@ ach@@ ish .
and when he heard say of Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , be@@ hold , he is come out to fight against the@@ e : he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast heard what the kings of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a have done to all lands , by destroying them ut@@ ter@@ ly : and s@@ halt th@@ ou be delivered ?
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed ; as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in T@@ hel@@ as@@ ar ?
where is the king of Ham@@ ath , and the king of Ar@@ p@@ ad , and the king of the city of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , of H@@ ena , and Iv@@ ah ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter of the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
Lord , bo@@ w down th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear : open , Lord , th@@ ine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b , which hat@@ h sent him to re@@ pro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , save th@@ ou us out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that th@@ ou art the Lord God , even th@@ ou only .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dig@@ ged and dr@@ un@@ k st@@ range waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dri@@ ed up all the rivers of bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed places .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste f@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
but I know TH@@ Y abo@@ de , and TH@@ Y going out , and TH@@ Y coming in , and TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me .
and the re@@ mn@@ ant that is escaped of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall yet again take root down@@ ward , and bear fruit up@@ ward .
for out of Jer@@ usalem shall go forth a re@@ mn@@ ant , and they that escape out of mount Z@@ ion : the z@@ e@@ al of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , He shall not come into this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
then he turned his face to the wall , and pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , saying ,
and it came to pass , a@@ fore I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : n@@ ay , but let the shadow return back@@ ward ten degrees .
and I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees back@@ ward , by which it had gone down in the di@@ al of A@@ haz .
at that time Ber@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah : for he had heard that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had been si@@ ck .
and he said , What have they seen in th@@ ine house ? and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered , All the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not she@@ wed them .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store un@@ to this day , shall be carried into Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then said H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah un@@ to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , Go@@ od is the word of the Lord which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Hep@@ h@@ zi @@@ -@@ @ bah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and he built al@@ tar@@ s for all the host of heav@@ en in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
and I will for@@ sake the re@@ mn@@ ant of mine inher@@ it@@ ance , and deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall become a pre@@ y and a sp@@ oil to all their enem@@ ies ;
because they have done that which was ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even un@@ to this day .
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Am@@ on was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th , the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as his father Man@@ as@@ se@@ h did .
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the id@@ ols that his father served , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them :
and he for@@ so@@ ok the Lord God of his fa@@ thers , and walked not in the way of the Lord .
and the servants of Am@@ on consp@@ ired against him , and sle@@ w the king in his own house .
and the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he was buried in his se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Jos@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty and one years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h , the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Bos@@ c@@ ath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the ke@@ epers of the door have gathered of the people :
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there was no rec@@ kon@@ ing made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully .
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said un@@ to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be she@@ wed the king , saying , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est hat@@ h delivered me a book . and Sha@@ ph@@ an read it before the king .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sahi@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h read :
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h which sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , As tou@@ ching the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
and he br@@ ake down the houses of the so@@ dom@@ ites , that were by the house of the Lord , where the women wo@@ ve han@@ g@@ ings for the gro@@ ve .
nevertheless the pri@@ ests of the high places came not up to the alt@@ ar of the Lord in Jer@@ usalem , but they did eat of the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread among their bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he def@@ iled Top@@ het@@ h , which is in the val@@ ley of the children of Hin@@ no@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mo@@ le@@ ch .
and he br@@ ake in pieces the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and filled their places with the b@@ ones of men .
and he sle@@ w all the pri@@ ests of the high places that were there upon the al@@ tar@@ s , and burned men 's b@@ ones upon them , and returned to Jer@@ usalem .
and the king comman@@ ded all the people , saying , keep the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord your God , as it is written in the book of this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the Lord turned not from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , where@@ with his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ations that Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him with@@ al .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fa@@ thers had done .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h put him in bands at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jer@@ usalem ; and put the land to a tri@@ bute of an hundred tal@@ ents of silver , and a tal@@ ent of gold .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h made Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king in the room of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and turned his name to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ze@@ bu@@ da@@ h , the daughter of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah of Rum@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fa@@ thers had done .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had taken from the river of Egypt un@@ to the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was E@@ igh@@ teen years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem three months . and his mother 's name was Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ ta , the daughter of El@@ na@@ than of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father had done .
at that time the servants of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up against Jer@@ usalem , and the city was bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed .
and Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came against the city , and his servants did bes@@ i@@ ege it .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah his father 's brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the fam@@ ine prev@@ ailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
and the army of the Chal@@ de@@ es pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took him in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and all his army were sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and they sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he bur@@ n@@ t the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and every great man 's house bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
and all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ es , that were with the captain of the guard , br@@ ake down the walls of Jer@@ usalem round about .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the re@@ mn@@ ant of the multi@@ tude , did Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vin@@ ed@@ res@@ s@@ ers and hus@@ b@@ and@@ men .
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and all the vessels of br@@ ass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
the two pil@@ lars , one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord ; the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
and the captain of the guard took Ser@@ ai@@ ah the chief pri@@ est , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the second pri@@ est , and the three ke@@ epers of the door :
and Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan captain of the guard took these , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah :
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away out of their land .
and all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the armies , ar@@ ose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ es .
and he sp@@ ake kin@@ dly to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings that were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
and changed his prison gar@@ ments : and he did eat bread continu@@ ally before him all the days of his life .
and his allow@@ ance was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .

for these L@@ evi@@ tes , the four chief por@@ ters , were in their set office , and were over the ch@@ ambers and treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God .
and they lo@@ d@@ ged round about the house of God , because the charge was upon them , and the opening there@@ of every morning per@@ tained to them .
and certain of them had the charge of the minist@@ ering vessels , that they should bring them in and out by tal@@ e .
some of them also were appointed to over@@ see the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .

and when they had stri@@ pped him , they took his head , and his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to carry ti@@ dings un@@ to their id@@ ols , and to the people .
therefore came all the el@@ ders of Israel to the king to He@@ br@@ on ; and David made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them in He@@ br@@ on before the Lord ; and they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel , according to the word of the Lord by Samuel .

these also are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and after him was Ele@@ azar the son of Do@@ do , the A@@ ho@@ h@@ ite , who was one of the three m@@ igh@@ ties .
and they set themselves in the mid@@ st of that par@@ cel , and delivered it , and sle@@ w the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and the Lord sav@@ ed them by a great deliver@@ ance .
now three of the thirty cap@@ tains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , he sle@@ w them , and had a name among the three .

these were of the sons of G@@ ad , cap@@ tains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flo@@ wn all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , and Michael , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and Eli@@ hu , and Zil@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of the thousands that were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and they helped David against the band of the ro@@ vers : for they were all m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and were cap@@ tains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h that b@@ are shield and spe@@ ar were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
of the children of Simeon , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of L@@ evi four thousand and six hundred .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was the leader of the Aar@@ on@@ ites , and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ;
and Zad@@ ok , a young man m@@ igh@@ ty of val@@ our , and of his father 's house twenty and two cap@@ tains .
and of the children of Benjamin , the kin@@ d@@ red of Sa@@ ul , three thousand : for hi@@ ther@@ to the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Sa@@ ul .
and of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im twenty thousand and eight hundred , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , famous throughout the house of their fa@@ thers .
and of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h E@@ igh@@ teen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make David king .
and of the Dani@@ tes expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred .
and of As@@ her , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , for@@ ty thousand .
and there they were with David three days , e@@ ating and drinking : for their bre@@ th@@ ren had prepared for them .
and David consul@@ ted with the cap@@ tains of thousands and hundreds , and with every leader .
and let us bring again the Ar@@ k of our God to us : for we inqu@@ ired not at it in the days of Sa@@ ul .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so David gathered all Israel together , from Shi@@ h@@ or of Egypt even un@@ to the entering of Ham@@ ath , to bring the Ar@@ k of God from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im .
and they carried the Ar@@ k of God in a new c@@ art out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b : and Uz@@ za and A@@ hi@@ o dra@@ ve the c@@ art .
and David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with har@@ ps , and with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with tim@@ bre@@ ls , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets .
and when they came un@@ to the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Chi@@ don , Uz@@ za put forth his hand to hold the Ar@@ k ; for the ox@@ en stumb@@ led .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he smo@@ te him , because he put his hand to the Ar@@ k : and there he died before God .
and David was disp@@ le@@ ased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uz@@ za : where@@ fore that place is called Per@@ ez @@@ -@@ @ uz@@ za to this day .
so David brought not the Ar@@ k home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and the Ar@@ k of God remained with the family of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom in his house three months . and the Lord b@@ les@@ sed the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and all that he had .
now H@@ i@@ ram king of T@@ y@@ re sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to David , and tim@@ ber of c@@ ed@@ ars , with mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters , to build him an house .
and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his k@@ ing@@ dom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
now these are the names of his children which he had in Jer@@ usalem ; Sh@@ am@@ mu@@ a , and Sho@@ ba@@ b , Na@@ than , and Solomon ,
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that David was ano@@ in@@ ted king over all Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to seek David . and David heard of it , and went out against them .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and spread themselves in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and David inqu@@ ired of God , saying , shall I go up against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? and w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou deliver them into mine hand ? and the Lord said un@@ to him , G@@ o up ; for I will deliver them into th@@ ine hand .
and when they had left their go@@ ds there , David gave a comman@@ d@@ ment , and they were burned with fire .
therefore David inqu@@ ired again of God ; and God said un@@ to him , G@@ o not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees .
David therefore did as God comman@@ ded him : and they smo@@ te the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines from Gi@@ be@@ on even to Gaz@@ er .
and the f@@ ame of David went out into all lands ; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the Ar@@ k of God , and pit@@ ched for it a tent .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to his place , which he had prepared for it .
of the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h ; U@@ ri@@ el the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Mer@@ ari ; A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m ; Jo@@ el the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and thirty :
of the sons of Eli@@ z@@ ap@@ han ; Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred :
of the sons of He@@ br@@ on ; Eli@@ el the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren fo@@ ur@@ score :
of the sons of Uz@@ zi@@ el ; Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and twelve .
and David called for Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests , and for the L@@ evi@@ tes , for U@@ ri@@ el , A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , and Jo@@ el , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and Eli@@ el , and Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b ,
for because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
so the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves to bring up the Ar@@ k of the Lord God of Israel .
and the children of the L@@ evi@@ tes b@@ are the Ar@@ k of God upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders with the st@@ aves there@@ on , as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded according to the word of the Lord .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their bre@@ th@@ ren to be the singers with instruments of musi@@ ck , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his bre@@ th@@ ren , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their bre@@ th@@ ren , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so the singers , H@@ eman , A@@ sap@@ h , and E@@ than , were appointed to sound with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als of br@@ ass ;
and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and Az@@ i@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , and Eli@@ a@@ b , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies on Ala@@ mo@@ th ;
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ phe@@ le@@ h , and Mik@@ ne@@ i@@ ah , and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and Je@@ i@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps on the Sh@@ emin@@ ith to exc@@ el .
and it came to pass , when God helped the L@@ evi@@ tes that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , that they offered seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams .
so they brought the Ar@@ k of God , and set it in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es and peace offer@@ ings before God .
and when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of the Lord .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine .
and he appointed certain of the L@@ evi@@ tes to minister before the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and to record , and to than@@ k and praise the Lord God of Israel :
then on that day David delivered first this p@@ sal@@ m to than@@ k the Lord into the hand of A@@ sap@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren .
give thanks un@@ to the Lord , call upon his name , make known his de@@ eds among the people .
sing un@@ to him , sing p@@ sal@@ ms un@@ to him , talk ye of all his won@@ dro@@ us works .
gl@@ ory ye in his hol@@ y name : let the heart of them re@@ jo@@ ice that seek the Lord .
and hat@@ h confirmed the same to Jac@@ o@@ b for a law , and to Israel for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and when they went from nation to nation , and from one k@@ ing@@ dom to another people ;
declare his gl@@ ory among the he@@ a@@ then ; his mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous works among all nations .
for great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised : he also is to be fear@@ ed above all go@@ ds .
give un@@ to the Lord the gl@@ ory due un@@ to his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the Lord in the beauty of hol@@ iness .
fear before him , all the ear@@ th : the world also shall be stable , that it be not moved .
let the sea ro@@ ar , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of : let the fields re@@ jo@@ ice , and all that is there@@ in .
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord , because he co@@ me@@ th to judge the ear@@ th .
and say ye , S@@ ave us , O God of our sal@@ vation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the he@@ a@@ then , that we may give thanks to TH@@ Y hol@@ y name , and gl@@ ory in TH@@ Y praise .
so he left there before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord A@@ sap@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required :
and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and his bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ,
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord upon the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he comman@@ ded Israel ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the Lord , because his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un with tr@@ ump@@ ets and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un were por@@ ters .
and all the people depar@@ ted every man to his house : and David returned to b@@ less his house .
and it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Na@@ than , saying ,
for I have not d@@ wel@@ t in an house since the day that I brought up Israel un@@ to this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tab@@ ern@@ acle to another .
now therefore thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to my ser@@ vant David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , I took the@@ e from the she@@ ep@@ co@@ te , even from following the she@@ ep , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be ru@@ ler over my people Israel :
and I have been with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou h@@ ast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies from before the@@ e , and have made the@@ e a name like the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mer@@ cy away from him , as I took it from him that was before the@@ e :
but I will settle him in mine house and in my k@@ ing@@ dom for ever : and his th@@ r@@ one shall be established for ever@@ more .
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Na@@ than speak un@@ to David .
O Lord , for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , h@@ ast th@@ ou done all this gre@@ at@@ ness , in making known all these great things .
O Lord , there is none like the@@ e , neither is there any God bes@@ ide the@@ e , according to all that we have heard with our e@@ ars .
for th@@ ou , O my God , h@@ ast told TH@@ Y ser@@ vant that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t build him an house : therefore TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h found in his heart to pra@@ y before the@@ e .
and now , Lord , th@@ ou art God , and h@@ ast promised this Go@@ od@@ ness un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant :
now therefore let it ple@@ ase the@@ e to b@@ less the house of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , that it may be before the@@ e for ever : for th@@ ou b@@ les@@ s@@ est , O Lord , and it shall be b@@ les@@ sed for ever .
and David smo@@ te Had@@ are@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah un@@ to Ham@@ ath , as he went to st@@ ab@@ lish his domin@@ ion by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
and David took from him a thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and seven thousand hor@@ se@@ men , and twenty thousand foot@@ men : David also h@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed all the char@@ i@@ ot hor@@ ses , but reserved of them an hundred char@@ i@@ ots .
and when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ are@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
then David put gar@@ ris@@ ons in Syria @@@ -@@ @ Dam@@ as@@ cus ; and the Syri@@ ans became David 's servants , and brought gifts . thus the Lord preserved David w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went .
and David took the shi@@ elds of gold that were on the servants of Had@@ are@@ zer , and brought them to Jer@@ usalem .
likewise from Ti@@ b@@ hat@@ h , and from Ch@@ un , cities of Had@@ are@@ zer , brought David very much br@@ ass , where@@ with Solomon made the br@@ as@@ en sea , and the pil@@ lars , and the vessels of br@@ ass .
now when T@@ ou king of Ham@@ ath heard how David had s@@ mit@@ ten all the host of Had@@ are@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah ;
moreover Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w of the E@@ dom@@ ites in the val@@ ley of salt E@@ igh@@ teen thousand .
and he put gar@@ ris@@ ons in E@@ dom ; and all the E@@ dom@@ ites became David 's servants . thus the Lord preserved David w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went .
and Jo@@ a@@ b the son Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah was over the host ; and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud , rec@@ order .
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and S@@ hav@@ s@@ ha was s@@ cri@@ be ;
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ i@@ ten of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and S@@ hav@@ s@@ ha was s@@ cri@@ be ;
now it came to pass after this , that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
and the rest of the people he delivered un@@ to the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and they set themselves in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and it came to pass after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; at which time Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
and there was war again with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and El@@ han@@ an the son of J@@ air sle@@ w L@@ ah@@ mi the brother of Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te , whose spe@@ ar staff was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
these were born un@@ to the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
but L@@ evi and Benjamin counted he not among them : for the king 's word was ab@@ omin@@ able to Jo@@ a@@ b .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded G@@ ad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and David went up at the saying of G@@ ad , which he sp@@ ake in the name of the Lord .
and Or@@ nan turned back , and saw the an@@ gel ; and his four sons with him hi@@ d themselves . now Or@@ nan was th@@ res@@ hing wheat .
and as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
and David built there an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , and called upon the Lord ; and he answ@@ ered him from heav@@ en by fire upon the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and the Lord comman@@ ded the an@@ gel ; and he put up his s@@ word again into the she@@ ath there@@ of .
at that time when David saw that the Lord had answ@@ ered him in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , then he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there .
but David could not go before it to inqu@@ ire of God : for he was afraid because of the s@@ word of the an@@ gel of the Lord .
then David said , This is the house of the Lord God , and this is the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering for Israel .
and David comman@@ ded to gather together the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to he@@ w w@@ rought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in ab@@ und@@ ance for the n@@ ails for the doors of the gates , and for the join@@ ings ; and br@@ ass in ab@@ und@@ ance without weight ;
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house un@@ to the name of the Lord my God :
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel for ever .
now , my son , the Lord be with the@@ e ; and prosp@@ er th@@ ou , and build the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God , as he hat@@ h said of the@@ e .
only the Lord give the@@ e wis@@ dom and understanding , and give the@@ e charge concerning Israel , that th@@ ou may@@ est keep the law of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou prosp@@ er , if th@@ ou tak@@ est heed to fulfil the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which the Lord charged Mos@@ es with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dre@@ ad not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed .
moreover there are work@@ men with the@@ e in ab@@ und@@ ance , he@@ wers and workers of stone and tim@@ ber , and all manner of c@@ un@@ ning men for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the br@@ ass , and the iron , there is no number . arise therefore , and be doing , and the Lord be with the@@ e .
David also comman@@ ded all the pr@@ inces of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
so when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
now the L@@ evi@@ tes were num@@ ber@@ ed from the age of thirty years and up@@ ward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord ; and six thousand were officers and judges :
moreover four thousand were por@@ ters ; and four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise there@@ with .
and David divided them into courses among the sons of L@@ evi , name@@ ly , Ger@@ sh@@ on , Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari .
and the sons of Shi@@ me@@ i were , Jah@@ ath , Z@@ ina , and Je@@ ush , and Ber@@ i@@ ah . these four were the sons of Shi@@ me@@ i .
and Jah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and Ber@@ i@@ ah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one rec@@ kon@@ ing , according to their father 's house .
now concerning Mos@@ es the man of God , his sons were named of the tri@@ be of L@@ evi .
and the sons of Eli@@ ez@@ er were , Re@@ habi@@ ah the chief . and Eli@@ ez@@ er had none other sons ; but the sons of Re@@ habi@@ ah were very many .
and Ele@@ azar died , and had no sons , but da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and their bre@@ th@@ ren the sons of K@@ ish took them .
and also un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes ; they shall no more carry the tab@@ ern@@ acle , nor any vessels of it for the service there@@ of .
now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron ; Nad@@ a@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ hu , Ele@@ azar , and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
but Nad@@ a@@ b and A@@ bi@@ hu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Ele@@ z@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar executed the pri@@ est 's office .
and David distributed them , both Zad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their offices in their service .
concerning Re@@ habi@@ ah : of the sons of Re@@ habi@@ ah , the first was Is@@ shi@@ ah .
of the Iz@@ har@@ ites ; S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th : of the sons of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th ; Jah@@ ath .
the brother of Micha@@ h was Is@@ shi@@ ah : of the sons of Is@@ shi@@ ah ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
the sons of Mer@@ ari were Mah@@ li and Mus@@ hi : the sons of Ja@@ az@@ i@@ ah ; Ben@@ o .
the sons of Mer@@ ari by Ja@@ az@@ i@@ ah ; Ben@@ o , and Sho@@ ham , and Z@@ acc@@ ur , and I@@ br@@ i .
the sons also of Mus@@ hi ; Mah@@ li , and E@@ der , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th . these were the sons of the L@@ evi@@ tes after the house of their fa@@ thers .
of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h ; Z@@ acc@@ ur , and Joseph , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and As@@ are@@ lah , the sons of A@@ sap@@ h under the hands of A@@ sap@@ h , which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied according to the order of the king .
all these were the sons of H@@ eman the king 's se@@ er in the words of God , to lift up the Hor@@ n . and God gave to H@@ eman fo@@ ur@@ teen sons and three da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
so the number of them , with their bre@@ th@@ ren that were instruc@@ ted in the songs of the Lord , even all that were c@@ un@@ ning , was two hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and eight .
the third to Z@@ acc@@ ur , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the fourth to Iz@@ ri , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the fifth to N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the sixth to Buk@@ ki@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the seventh to J@@ es@@ har@@ e@@ lah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the eighth to J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the ninth to Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the tenth to Shi@@ me@@ i , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the ele@@ venth to Az@@ are@@ el , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the twel@@ f@@ th to Has@@ habi@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the thir@@ teen@@ th to Sh@@ ub@@ a@@ el , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th to Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th to Jos@@ h@@ bek@@ as@@ ha@@ h , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the eigh@@ teen@@ th to Han@@ ani , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th to Mal@@ lo@@ th@@ i , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the tw@@ enti@@ eth to Eli@@ ath@@ ah , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the one and tw@@ enti@@ eth to Ho@@ th@@ ir , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the two and tw@@ enti@@ eth to G@@ id@@ dal@@ ti , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth to Ma@@ haz@@ i@@ o@@ th , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve :
the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth to Rom@@ am@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ er , he , his sons , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , were twelve .
concerning the divisions of the por@@ ters : of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes was Mes@@ he@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of k@@ ore , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h .
moreover the sons of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom were , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the fir@@ st@@ born , Je@@ ho@@ zab@@ ad the second , Jo@@ ah the third , and S@@ ac@@ ar the fourth , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the fifth ,
also un@@ to Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
the sons of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah ; O@@ th@@ ni , and Rep@@ ha@@ el , and Ob@@ ed , El@@ zab@@ ad , whose bre@@ th@@ ren were strong men , Eli@@ hu , and Sem@@ achi@@ ah .
all these of the sons of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom : they and their sons and their bre@@ th@@ ren , able men for strength for the service , were thre@@ es@@ core and two of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons ; Sim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him the chief ; )
H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the second , T@@ eb@@ ali@@ ah the third , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the fourth : all the sons and bre@@ th@@ ren of Hos@@ ah were thir@@ teen .
among these were the divisions of the por@@ ters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the Lord .
and they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , for every gate .
and the lot eas@@ tw@@ ard fell to She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah . then for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah his son , a wise coun@@ seller , they cast lots ; and his lot came out nor@@ th@@ ward .
these are the divisions of the por@@ ters among the sons of k@@ ore , and among the sons of Mer@@ ari .
and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
as concerning the sons of La@@ adan ; the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite La@@ adan , chief fa@@ thers , even of La@@ adan the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite , were Je@@ hi@@ eli .
the sons of Je@@ hi@@ eli ; Z@@ eth@@ am , and Jo@@ el his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the Lord .
and She@@ bu@@ el the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Mos@@ es , was ru@@ ler of the treasures .
which S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith and his bre@@ th@@ ren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fa@@ thers , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the host , had dedicated .
over the first course for the first month was Jas@@ ho@@ be@@ am the son of Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of Per@@ ez was the chief of all the cap@@ tains of the host for the first month .
and over the course of the second month was Do@@ da@@ i an A@@ ho@@ h@@ ite , and of his course was Mik@@ lo@@ th also the ru@@ ler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , a chief pri@@ est : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
this is that Ben@@ ai@@ ah , who was m@@ igh@@ ty among the thirty , and above the thirty : and in his course was Am@@ m@@ iz@@ ab@@ ad his son .
the fourth captain for the fourth month was A@@ sah@@ el the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , and Z@@ eb@@ adi@@ ah his son after him : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .

furthermore over the tri@@ bes of Israel : the ru@@ ler of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites was Eli@@ ez@@ er the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri : of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h :
of Ju@@ da@@ h , Eli@@ hu , one of the bre@@ th@@ ren of David : of Is@@ sac@@ har , Om@@ ri the son of Michael :
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Hos@@ he@@ a the son of Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah : of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Jo@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah :
of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , I@@ d@@ do the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah : of Benjamin , Ja@@ asi@@ el the son of Ab@@ ner :
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heav@@ ens .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wr@@ ath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chron@@ ic@@ les of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the sto@@ re@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the c@@ ast@@ les , was J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over them that did the work of the field for til@@ la@@ ge of the ground was E@@ z@@ ri the son of C@@ hel@@ u@@ b :
and over the v@@ ine@@ yards was Shi@@ me@@ i the Ram@@ ath@@ ite : over the increase of the v@@ ine@@ yards for the wine cel@@ lars was Z@@ ab@@ di the Shi@@ ph@@ m@@ ite :

over the ca@@ me@@ ls also was O@@ bil the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elite : and over the ass@@ es was J@@ eh@@ de@@ i@@ ah the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite :
and over the f@@ loc@@ ks was Jaz@@ iz the Hag@@ er@@ ite . all these were the rul@@ ers of the sub@@ stance which was king David 's .
also Jon@@ athan David 's un@@ cle was a coun@@ seller , a wise man , and a s@@ cri@@ be : and Je@@ hi@@ el the son of H@@ ach@@ mon@@ i was with the king 's sons :
and A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el was the king 's coun@@ seller : and Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite was the king 's compan@@ ion :
and after A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el was Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar : and the general of the king 's army was Jo@@ a@@ b .
but God said un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not build an house for my name , because th@@ ou h@@ ast been a man of war , and h@@ ast shed blood .
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hat@@ h given me many sons , ) he hat@@ h chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom of the Lord over Israel .
moreover I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom for ever , if he be constant to do my comman@@ d@@ ments and my judg@@ ments , as at this day .
take heed now ; for the Lord hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to build an house for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : be strong , and do it .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of she@@ w@@ bread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , that spread out their w@@ ings , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
even three thousand tal@@ ents of gold , of the gold of Op@@ hir , and seven thousand tal@@ ents of refin@@ ed silver , to over@@ lay the walls of the houses with@@ al :
then the chief of the fa@@ thers and pr@@ inces of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rul@@ ers of the king 's work , offered will@@ ingly ,
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand tal@@ ents and ten thousand dr@@ ams , and of silver ten thousand tal@@ ents , and of br@@ ass E@@ igh@@ teen thousand tal@@ ents , and one hundred thousand tal@@ ents of iron .
and they with whom pre@@ ci@@ ous stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Je@@ hi@@ el the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite .
then the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , for that they offered will@@ ingly , because with perfect heart they offered will@@ ingly to the Lord : and David the king also re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy .
both ri@@ ches and honour come of the@@ e , and th@@ ou re@@ ign@@ est over all ; and in th@@ ine hand is power and might ; and in th@@ ine hand it is to make great , and to give strength un@@ to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so will@@ ingly after this sort ? for all things come of the@@ e , and of th@@ ine own have we given the@@ e .
for we are st@@ ran@@ gers before the@@ e , and so@@ jour@@ ners , as were all our fa@@ thers : our days on the ear@@ th are as a shadow , and there is none abi@@ ding .
and give un@@ to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , and TH@@ Y stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
then Solomon sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the Lord as king instead of David his father , and prosp@@ ered ; and all Israel obe@@ yed him .
and all the pr@@ inces , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the sons likewise of king David , submitted themselves un@@ to Solomon the king .
and the Lord mag@@ ni@@ fied Solomon exce@@ ed@@ ingly in the sight of all Israel , and bes@@ to@@ wed upon him such royal maj@@ es@@ ty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
and the time that he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel was for@@ ty years ; seven years re@@ ig@@ ned he in He@@ br@@ on , and thirty and three years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem .
and he died in a good old age , full of days , ri@@ ches , and honour : and Solomon his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and the Lord his God was with him , and mag@@ ni@@ fied him exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
then Solomon sp@@ ake un@@ to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fa@@ thers .
so Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but the Ar@@ k of God had David brought up from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , he put before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Con@@ gre@@ gation sought un@@ to it .
and Solomon went up th@@ ither to the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar before the Lord , which was at the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and offered a thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings upon it .
now , O Lord God , let TH@@ Y promise un@@ to David my father be established : for th@@ ou h@@ ast made me king over a people like the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in multi@@ tude .
give me now wis@@ dom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this TH@@ Y people , that is so great ?
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on to Jer@@ usalem , from before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel .
and the king made silver and gold at Jer@@ usalem as plen@@ te@@ ous as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ar trees made he as the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that are in the val@@ e for ab@@ und@@ ance .
and Solomon had hor@@ ses brought out of Egypt , and lin@@ en yar@@ n : the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received the lin@@ en yar@@ n at a price .
and Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord , and an house for his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and Solomon told out thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men to bear bur@@ den@@ s , and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand to he@@ w in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred to over@@ see them .
then Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re answ@@ ered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Bec@@ ause the Lord hat@@ h lov@@ ed his people , he hat@@ h made the@@ e king over them .
and now I have sent a c@@ un@@ ning man , en@@ du@@ ed with understanding , of Hur@@ am my father 's ,
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as th@@ ou s@@ halt need : and we will bring it to the@@ e in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and th@@ ou shall carry it up to Jer@@ usalem .
and Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing where@@ with David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found an hundred and fif@@ ty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem in mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where the Lord appeared un@@ to David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instruc@@ ted for the building of the house of God . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he gar@@ n@@ ished the house with pre@@ ci@@ ous stones for beauty : and the gold was gold of Par@@ v@@ aim .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the posts , and the walls there@@ of , and the doors there@@ of , with gold ; and gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the walls .
and he made the most hol@@ y house , the length where@@ of was according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred tal@@ ents .
and the weight of the n@@ ails was fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of gold . and he over@@ laid the up@@ per ch@@ ambers with gold .
and in the most hol@@ y house he made two ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms of image work , and over@@ laid them with gold .
and one wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts also , joining to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
the w@@ ings of these ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread themselves forth twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were in@@ ward .
also he made before the house two pil@@ lars of thirty and five cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the chap@@ iter that was on the top of each of them was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he made cha@@ ins , as in the or@@ acle , and put them on the heads of the pil@@ lars ; and made an hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
moreover he made an alt@@ ar of br@@ ass , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts the length there@@ of , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of .
also he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under it was the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of ox@@ en , which did comp@@ ass it round about : ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about . two ro@@ ws of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of it was an hand@@ b@@ read@@ th , and the bri@@ m of it like the work of the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies ; and it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
and he made ten cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temp@@ le , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred bas@@ ons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid the doors of them with br@@ ass .
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
and Hur@@ am made the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . and Hur@@ am finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
and four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on the two w@@ re@@ aths ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on each w@@ reath , to cover the two pom@@ me@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the pil@@ lars .
in the pla@@ in of Jordan did the king cast them , in the cla@@ y ground between Suc@@ co@@ th and Zer@@ ed@@ ath@@ ah .
thus Solomon made all these vessels in great ab@@ und@@ ance : for the weight of the br@@ ass could not be found out .
and Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden alt@@ ar also , and the tables where@@ on the she@@ w@@ bread was set ;
moreover the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks with their lam@@ ps , that they should bur@@ n after the manner before the or@@ acle , of p@@ ure gold ;
and the flowers , and the lam@@ ps , and the ton@@ gs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves un@@ to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , these did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed she@@ ep and ox@@ en , which could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
for the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread forth their w@@ ings over the place of the Ar@@ k , and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms covered the Ar@@ k and the st@@ aves there@@ of above .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k save the two tables which Mos@@ es put there@@ in at Ho@@ re@@ b , when the Lord made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place : ( for all the pri@@ ests that were present were sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and did not then wait by course :
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister by reason of the cl@@ oud : for the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the house of God .
and the king turned his face , and b@@ les@@ sed the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel : and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel stood .
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , who hat@@ h with his hands fulfilled that which he sp@@ ake with his m@@ outh to my father David , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
but the Lord said to David my father , For@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing th@@ ou s@@ halt not build the house ; but TH@@ Y son which shall come forth out of TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , he shall build the house for my name .
and in it have I put the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , that he made with the children of Israel .
and he stood before the alt@@ ar of the Lord in the presence of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , and spread forth his hands :
T@@ ho@@ u which h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
now then , O Lord God of Israel , let TH@@ Y word be ver@@ ified , which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David .
but will God in very de@@ ed d@@ well with men on the ear@@ th ? be@@ hold , heav@@ en and the heav@@ en of heav@@ ens can@@ not contain the@@ e ; how much less this house which I have built !
if a man sin against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to make him swe@@ ar , and the oath come before th@@ ine alt@@ ar in this house ;
and if TH@@ Y people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; and shall return and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and pra@@ y and make supp@@ lic@@ ation before the@@ e in this house ;
then what pray@@ er or what supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever shall be made of any man , or of all TH@@ Y people Israel , when every one shall know his own sor@@ e and his own gri@@ ef , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and ren@@ der un@@ to every man according un@@ to all his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou only know@@ est the hear@@ ts of the children of men : )
that they may fear the@@ e , to walk in TH@@ Y ways , so long as they live in the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
if TH@@ Y people go out to war against their enem@@ ies by the way that th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and they pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward this city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name ;
then hear th@@ ou from the heav@@ ens their pray@@ er and their supp@@ lic@@ ation , and maintain their cause .
now , my God , let , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , th@@ ine eyes be open , and let th@@ ine e@@ ars be att@@ ent un@@ to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
now therefore arise , O Lord God , into TH@@ Y resting place , th@@ ou , and the Ar@@ k of TH@@ Y strength : let TH@@ Y pri@@ ests , O Lord God , be clo@@ th@@ ed with sal@@ vation , and let TH@@ Y sa@@ ints re@@ jo@@ ice in Go@@ od@@ ness .
O Lord God , turn not away the face of th@@ ine ano@@ in@@ ted : remember the mer@@ cies of David TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
and the pri@@ ests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand she@@ ep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great Con@@ gre@@ gation , from the entering in of Ham@@ ath un@@ to the river of Egypt .
and in the eighth day they made a so@@ lem@@ n assembly : for they kept the dedic@@ ation of the alt@@ ar seven days , and the feast seven days .
and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said un@@ to him , I have heard TH@@ Y pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if I shut up heav@@ en that there be no rain , or if I command the loc@@ ust@@ s to dev@@ our the land , or if I send p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce among my people ;
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine e@@ ars att@@ ent un@@ to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
for now have I chosen and sanc@@ ti@@ fied this house , that my name may be there for ever : and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpet@@ ually .
and as for the@@ e , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and s@@ halt observe my stat@@ ues and my judg@@ ments ;
but if ye turn away , and for@@ sake my stat@@ utes and my comman@@ d@@ ments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and un@@ to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , where@@ in Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
that the cities which Hur@@ am had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to d@@ well there .
and he built T@@ ad@@ m@@ or in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and all the store cities , which he built in Ham@@ ath .
also he built Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , f@@ enced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people that were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consu@@ med not , them did Solomon make to pay tri@@ bute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and cap@@ tains of his char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men .
and these were the chief of king Solomon 's officers , even two hundred and fif@@ ty , that b@@ are rule over the people .
then Solomon offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord on the alt@@ ar of the Lord , which he had built before the por@@ ch ,
and they depar@@ ted not from the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king un@@ to the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared un@@ to the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished . so the house of the Lord was perf@@ ected .
then went Solomon to E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber , and to E@@ lo@@ th , at the sea side in the land of E@@ dom .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of th@@ ine acts , and of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom :
happy are TH@@ Y men , and happy are these TH@@ Y servants , which stand continu@@ ally before the@@ e , and hear TH@@ Y wis@@ dom .
and the servants also of Hur@@ am , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Op@@ hir , brought al@@ gu@@ m trees and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and six tal@@ ents of gold ;
and three hundred shi@@ elds made he of beaten gold : three hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
moreover the king made a great th@@ r@@ one of Iv@@ ory , and over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold .
and twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . there was not the like made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
for the king 's ships went to Tar@@ sh@@ ish with the servants of Hur@@ am : every three years once came the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish bringing gold , and silver , Iv@@ ory , and ap@@ es , and peac@@ oc@@ ks .
and all the kings of the ear@@ th sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wis@@ dom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , har@@ ness , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
and he re@@ ig@@ ned over all the kings from the river even un@@ to the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to the border of Egypt .
and the king made silver in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ar trees made he as the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that are in the low pla@@ ins in ab@@ und@@ ance .
and they brought un@@ to Solomon hor@@ ses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
and Solomon sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and he was buried in the city of David his father : and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and they sent and called him . so Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel came and sp@@ ake to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took coun@@ sel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , What coun@@ sel give ye me to return answer to this people ?
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel which the old men gave him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and he said un@@ to them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , ease somewhat the yok@@ e that TH@@ Y father did put upon us ?
for whereas my father put a heavy yok@@ e upon you , I will put more to your yok@@ e : my father ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed you with w@@ hi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions .
but as for the children of Israel that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned over them .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am that was over the tri@@ bute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jer@@ usalem , he gathered of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand chosen men , which were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
and he for@@ ti@@ fied the strong holds , and put cap@@ tains in them , and store of vic@@ tual , and of oil and wine .
and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes that were in all Israel res@@ or@@ ted to him out of all their co@@ asts .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from exec@@ ut@@ ing the pri@@ est 's office un@@ to the Lord :
and he or@@ da@@ ined him pri@@ ests for the high places , and for the dev@@ ils , and for the cal@@ ves which he had made .
and after them out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel such as set their hear@@ ts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jer@@ usalem , to sacrifice un@@ to the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took him Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th the son of David to wife , and A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il the daughter of Eli@@ a@@ b the son of J@@ es@@ se ;
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am lov@@ ed Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h the daughter of Ab@@ sal@@ om above all his wi@@ ves and his conc@@ ub@@ ines : ( for he took E@@ igh@@ teen wi@@ ves , and thre@@ es@@ core conc@@ ub@@ ines ; and beg@@ at twenty and eight sons , and thre@@ es@@ core da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . )
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h the chief , to be ru@@ ler among his bre@@ th@@ ren : for he thought to make him king .
and it came to pass , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had established the k@@ ing@@ dom , and had strengthened himself , he for@@ so@@ ok the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , because they had trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord ,
with twelve hundred char@@ i@@ ots , and thre@@ es@@ core thousand hor@@ se@@ men : and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt ; the Lu@@ bi@@ ms , the Suk@@ ki@@ ims , and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians .
and when the king entered into the house of the Lord , the guard came and f@@ et@@ ched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
and when he hum@@ b@@ led himself , the wr@@ ath of the Lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether : and also in Ju@@ da@@ h things went well .
he re@@ ig@@ ned three years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Micha@@ i@@ ah the daughter of U@@ ri@@ el of Gi@@ be@@ ah . and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah stood up upon mount Zem@@ ar@@ aim , which is in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and said , He@@ ar me , th@@ ou Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and all Israel ;
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hat@@ h rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
and there are gathered un@@ to him v@@ ain men , the children of Bel@@ ial , and have strengthened themselves against Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was young and ten@@ der@@ hear@@ ted , and could not with@@ stand them .
but Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am caused an amb@@ us@@ hment to come about behind them : so they were before Ju@@ da@@ h , and the amb@@ us@@ hment was behind them .
and when Ju@@ da@@ h looked back , be@@ hold , the battle was before and behind : and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and the pri@@ ests so@@ unded with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it came to pass , that God smo@@ te Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and his people sle@@ w them with a great sla@@ ughter : so there fell down sla@@ in of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h prev@@ ailed , because they reli@@ ed upon the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah pursu@@ ed after Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and took cities from him , Be@@ the@@ l with the towns there@@ of , and J@@ es@@ hn@@ ah with the towns there@@ of , and E@@ ph@@ rain with the towns there@@ of .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and his ways , and his say@@ ings , are written in the story of the pro@@ phe@@ t I@@ d@@ do .
so A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city of David : and A@@ SA his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and A@@ SA did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God :
for he took away the al@@ tar@@ s of the st@@ range go@@ ds , and the high places , and br@@ ake down the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves :
and comman@@ ded Ju@@ da@@ h to seek the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , and to do the law and the comman@@ d@@ ment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h the high places and the images : and the k@@ ing@@ dom was quiet before him .
and there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred char@@ i@@ ots ; and came un@@ to Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h .
and they smo@@ te all the cities round about Ger@@ ar ; for the fear of the Lord came upon them : and they sp@@ o@@ iled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much sp@@ oil in them .
they smo@@ te also the ten@@ ts of c@@ attle , and carried away she@@ ep and ca@@ me@@ ls in ab@@ und@@ ance , and returned to Jer@@ usalem .
now for a long season Israel hat@@ h been without the true God , and without a teaching pri@@ est , and without law .
but when they in their trouble did turn un@@ to the Lord God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great v@@ ex@@ ations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak : for your work shall be re@@ warded .
so they gathered themselves together at Jer@@ usalem in the third month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of A@@ SA .
and they offered un@@ to the Lord the same time , of the sp@@ oil which they had brought , seven hundred ox@@ en and seven thousand she@@ ep .
and they entered into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant to seek the Lord God of their fa@@ thers with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l ;
that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and they sw@@ are un@@ to the Lord with a l@@ oud voice , and with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with cor@@ n@@ ets .
but the high places were not taken away out of Israel : nevertheless the heart of A@@ SA was perfect all his days .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and there was no more war un@@ to the five and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of A@@ SA .
and it came to pass , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard it , that he left off building of Ram@@ ah , and let his work ce@@ ase .
then A@@ SA the king took all Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , where@@ with Ba@@ as@@ ha was building ; and he built there@@ with Ge@@ ba and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
were not the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians and the Lu@@ bi@@ ms a huge host , with very many char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men ? yet , because th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st rely on the Lord , he delivered them into th@@ ine hand .
then A@@ SA was wro@@ th with the se@@ er , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . and A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people the same time .
and , be@@ hold , the acts of A@@ SA , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and A@@ SA sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and died in the one and for@@ ti@@ eth year of his reign .
and he placed forces in all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
and the Lord was with J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not un@@ to Ba@@ al@@ im ;
but sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his comman@@ d@@ ments , and not after the do@@ ings of Israel .
therefore the Lord st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed the k@@ ing@@ dom in his hand ; and all Ju@@ da@@ h brought to J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at presents ; and he had ri@@ ches and honour in ab@@ und@@ ance .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord : moreover he took away the high places and gro@@ ves out of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught the people .
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the lands that were round about Ju@@ da@@ h , so that they made no war against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at .
also some of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at presents , and tri@@ bute silver ; and the Ara@@ bi@@ ans brought him f@@ loc@@ ks , seven thousand and seven hundred r@@ ams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he go@@ ats .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at wa@@ xed great exce@@ ed@@ ingly ; and he built in Ju@@ da@@ h c@@ ast@@ les , and cities of store .
and he had much business in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h : and the men of war , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , were in Jer@@ usalem .
and next to him was Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an the captain , and with him two hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand .
and next him was A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself un@@ to the Lord ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and of Benjamin ; Eli@@ ada a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ our , and with him armed men with bo@@ w and shield two hundred thousand .
and next him was Je@@ ho@@ zab@@ ad , and with him an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand ready prepared for the war .
these w@@ aited on the king , bes@@ ide those whom the king put in the f@@ enced cities throughout all Ju@@ da@@ h .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said un@@ to the king of Israel , inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , at the word of the Lord to day .
and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied so , saying , G@@ o up to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and prosp@@ er : for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
again he said , T@@ her@@ e@@ fore hear the word of the Lord ; I saw the Lord sitting upon his th@@ r@@ one , and all the host of heav@@ en standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the Lord said , Wh@@ o shall enti@@ ce A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one sp@@ ake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h put a lying spirit in the m@@ outh of these TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the Lord hat@@ h spoken ev@@ il against the@@ e .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and smo@@ te Mic@@ ai@@ ah upon the che@@ ek , and said , Wh@@ ich way went the Spiri@@ t of the Lord from me to speak un@@ to the@@ e ?
and Mic@@ ai@@ ah said , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt see on that day when th@@ ou s@@ halt go into an in@@ ner chamber to hide th@@ y@@ self .
then the king of Israel said , T@@ ake ye Mic@@ ai@@ ah , and carry him back to Am@@ on the governor of the city , and to Jo@@ ash the king 's son ;
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and fe@@ ed him with bread of aff@@ li@@ ction and with water of aff@@ li@@ ction , until I return in peace .
now the king of Syria had comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots that were with him , saying , F@@ ight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of Israel .
for it came to pass , that , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and the battle increased that day : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the king of Israel stayed himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
nevertheless there are good things found in the@@ e , in that th@@ ou h@@ ast taken away the gro@@ ves out of the land , and h@@ ast prepared th@@ ine heart to seek God .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem : and he went out again through the people from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and brought them back un@@ to the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
and he set judges in the land throughout all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , city by city ,
and said to the judges , T@@ ake heed what ye do : for ye judge not for man , but for the Lord , who is with you in the judgment .
and he charged them , saying , Th@@ us shall ye do in the fear of the Lord , fa@@ ith@@ fully , and with a perfect heart .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at fear@@ ed , and set himself to seek the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Ju@@ da@@ h gathered themselves together , to ask help of the Lord : even out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h they came to seek the Lord .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at stood in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , in the house of the Lord , before the new court ,
art not th@@ ou our God , who di@@ d@@ st drive out the inhabitants of this land before TH@@ Y people Israel , and g@@ av@@ est it to the se@@ ed of Ab@@ ra@@ ham TH@@ Y friend for ever ?
and they d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in , and have built the@@ e a sanc@@ tu@@ ary there@@ in for TH@@ Y name , saying ,
be@@ hold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of TH@@ Y possession , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given us to inher@@ it .
and all Ju@@ da@@ h stood before the Lord , with their little ones , their wi@@ ves , and their children .
then upon Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , a Lev@@ ite of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , came the Spiri@@ t of the Lord in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
to mor@@ row go ye down against them : be@@ hold , they come up by the c@@ lif@@ f of Z@@ iz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Bro@@ ok , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at bo@@ wed his head with his face to the ground : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem fell before the Lord , wor@@ shipping the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and of the children of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a l@@ oud voice on high .
and when they began to sing and to praise , the Lord set amb@@ ush@@ ments against the children of Am@@ mon , Mo@@ a@@ b , and mount Se@@ ir , which were come against Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they were s@@ mit@@ ten .
and when Ju@@ da@@ h came toward the watch to@@ wer in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they looked un@@ to the multi@@ tude , and , be@@ hold , they were dead bodies fallen to the ear@@ th , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , un@@ to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of them , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
and the fear of God was on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enem@@ ies of Israel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and he walked in the way of A@@ SA his father , and depar@@ ted not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hear@@ ts un@@ to the God of their fa@@ thers .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tar@@ sh@@ ish : and they made the ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber .
now J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David . and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he had bre@@ th@@ ren the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Michael , and She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah : all these were the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up to the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , he strengthened himself , and sle@@ w all his bre@@ th@@ ren with the s@@ word , and di@@ vers also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eight years in Jer@@ usalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b to wife : and he w@@ rought that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord .
in his days the E@@ dom@@ ites revol@@ ted from under the domin@@ ion of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made themselves a king .
then J@@ eh@@ or@@ am went forth with his pr@@ inces , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ ass@@ ed him in , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots .
so the E@@ dom@@ ites revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to this day . the same time also did Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ t from under his hand ; because he had for@@ sak@@ en the Lord God of his fa@@ thers .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Ju@@ da@@ h , and caused the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem to commit for@@ nic@@ ation , and comp@@ elled Ju@@ da@@ h there@@ to .
be@@ hold , with a great pla@@ gue will the Lord sm@@ ite TH@@ Y people , and TH@@ Y children , and TH@@ Y wi@@ ves , and all TH@@ Y goods :
moreover the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up against J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the spirit of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , that were near the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians :
and after all this the Lord smo@@ te him in his bo@@ wel@@ s with an inc@@ ur@@ able disease .
he also walked in the ways of the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for his mother was his coun@@ seller to do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord like the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for they were his coun@@ sel@@ lers after the death of his father to his destruction .
and the destruction of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah was of God by coming to Jor@@ am : for when he was come , he went out with J@@ eh@@ or@@ am against J@@ eh@@ u the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , whom the Lord had ano@@ in@@ ted to cut off the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment upon the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the bre@@ th@@ ren of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , that minist@@ ered to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , he sle@@ w them .
but when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she ar@@ ose and destroyed all the se@@ ed royal of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the king in the house of God . and he said un@@ to them , be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as the Lord hat@@ h said of the sons of David .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the doors ;
moreover Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
now when Ath@@ ali@@ ah heard the no@@ ise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the Lord :
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the hor@@ se gate by the king 's house , they sle@@ w her there .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the Lord 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down , and br@@ ake his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
and he set the por@@ ters at the gates of the house of the Lord , that none which was un@@ clean in any thing should enter in .
and all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed : and the city was quiet , after that they had sla@@ in Ath@@ ali@@ ah with the s@@ word .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Zi@@ bi@@ ah of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and Jo@@ ash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
and it came to pass after this , that Jo@@ ash was min@@ ded to repair the house of the Lord .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bes@@ to@@ w upon Ba@@ al@@ im .
and at the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment they made a ch@@ est , and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
and they made a proc@@ lamation through Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , to bring in to the Lord the collection that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of God laid upon Israel in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and all the pr@@ inces and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and brought in , and cast into the ch@@ est , until they had made an end .
so the work@@ men w@@ rought , and the work was perf@@ ected by them , and they set the house of God in his state , and strengthened it .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada wa@@ xed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
now after the death of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada came the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to the king . then the king hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to them .
and they left the house of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , and served gro@@ ves and id@@ ols : and wr@@ ath came upon Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for this their t@@ res@@ pass .
yet he sent pro@@ ph@@ ets to them , to bring them again un@@ to the Lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give e@@ ar .
and they consp@@ ired against him , and st@@ oned him with stones at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
thus Jo@@ ash the king remember@@ ed not the kin@@ d@@ ness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but sle@@ w his son . and when he died , he said , The Lord look upon it , and require it .
and these are they that consp@@ ired against him ; Z@@ ab@@ ad the son of Shi@@ me@@ ath an Am@@ mon@@ i@@ tes@@ s , and Je@@ ho@@ zab@@ ad the son of Sh@@ im@@ r@@ ith a Mo@@ abi@@ tes@@ s .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , but not with a perfect heart .
now it came to pass , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
he hired also an hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our out of Israel for an hundred tal@@ ents of silver .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with the@@ e ; for the Lord is not with Israel , to w@@ it , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make the@@ e fall before the enemy : for God hat@@ h power to help , and to cast down .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , to w@@ it , the army that was come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : where@@ fore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in great an@@ ger .
and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the val@@ ley of salt , and smo@@ te of the chi@@ d@@ ren of Se@@ ir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away cap@@ tive , and brought them un@@ to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
but A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah would not hear ; for it came of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , because they sought after the go@@ ds of E@@ dom .
so Jo@@ ash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Ju@@ da@@ h was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , first and last , be@@ hold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel ?
and they brought him upon hor@@ ses , and buried him with his fa@@ thers in the city of Ju@@ da@@ h .
then all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took Uz@@ zi@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the room of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
six@@ teen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty and two years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was J@@ ec@@ ol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah did .
and he sought God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosp@@ er .
and God helped him against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and against the Ara@@ bi@@ ans that d@@ wel@@ t in G@@ ur @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al , and the Meh@@ un@@ ims .
and the Am@@ mon@@ ites gave gifts to Uz@@ zi@@ ah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built tow@@ ers in Jer@@ usalem at the cor@@ ner gate , and at the val@@ ley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and for@@ ti@@ fied them .
the whole number of the chief of the fa@@ thers of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our were two thousand and six hundred .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with m@@ igh@@ ty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah prepared for them throughout all the host shi@@ elds , and spe@@ ars , and hel@@ me@@ ts , and haber@@ ge@@ ons , and bo@@ ws , and s@@ lings to cast stones .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temp@@ le of the Lord to bur@@ n incen@@ se upon the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est went in after him , and with him fo@@ ur@@ score pri@@ ests of the Lord , that were val@@ i@@ ant men :
now the rest of the acts of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , first and last , did I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , write .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Jer@@ us@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah did : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it he entered not into the temp@@ le of the Lord . and the people did yet cor@@ rup@@ tly .
he built the high gate of the house of the Lord , and on the wall of O@@ ph@@ el he built much .
moreover he built cities in the mountains of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the forests he built c@@ ast@@ les and tow@@ ers .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem .
and Jo@@ th@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city of David : and A@@ haz his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and made also m@@ ol@@ ten images for Ba@@ al@@ im .
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed also and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the high places , and on the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree .
for Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah sle@@ w in Ju@@ da@@ h an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all val@@ i@@ ant men ; because they had for@@ sak@@ en the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
and Z@@ ic@@ hri , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , sle@@ w Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the king 's son , and Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am the governor of the house , and El@@ kan@@ ah that was next to the king .
and the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for bon@@ d@@ men and bon@@ d@@ women un@@ to you : but are there not with you , even with you , sin@@ s against the Lord your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the cap@@ tives again , which ye have taken cap@@ tive of your bre@@ th@@ ren : for the fierce wr@@ ath of the Lord is upon you .
so the armed men left the cap@@ tives and the sp@@ oil before the pr@@ inces and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it un@@ to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but he helped him not .
and in the time of his dist@@ ress did he t@@ res@@ pass yet more against the Lord : this is that king A@@ haz .
and in every several city of Ju@@ da@@ h he made high places to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and provoked to an@@ ger the Lord God of his fa@@ thers .
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem : but they brought him not into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he re@@ ig@@ ned nine and twenty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and rep@@ aired them .
and he brought in the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and gathered them together into the east street ,
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the por@@ ch , and put out the lam@@ ps , and have not burned incen@@ se nor offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings in the hol@@ y place un@@ to the God of Israel .
for , lo , our fa@@ thers have fallen by the s@@ word , and our sons and our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters and our wi@@ ves are in cap@@ tivity for this .
now it is in mine heart to make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the Lord God of Israel , that his fierce wr@@ ath may turn away from us .
my sons , be not now neg@@ lig@@ ent : for the Lord hat@@ h chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister un@@ to him , and bur@@ n incen@@ se .
and they gathered their bre@@ th@@ ren , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and came , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king , by the words of the Lord , to cleans@@ e the house of the Lord .
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign did cast away in his trans@@ gres@@ sion , have we prepared and sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and , be@@ hold , they are before the alt@@ ar of the Lord .
then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king rose early , and gathered the rul@@ ers of the city , and went up to the house of the Lord .
and they brought forth the he go@@ ats for the sin offering before the king and the Con@@ gre@@ gation ; and they laid their hands upon them :
and the L@@ evi@@ tes stood with the instruments of David , and the pri@@ ests with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the alt@@ ar . and when the bur@@ n@@ t offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with the instruments or@@ da@@ ined by David king of Israel .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation wor@@ shi@@ pped , and the singers san@@ g , and the tr@@ um@@ pet@@ ers so@@ unded : and all this continued until the bur@@ n@@ t offering was finished .
and when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bo@@ wed themselves , and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and also the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings were in ab@@ und@@ ance , with the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , and the drink offer@@ ings for every bur@@ n@@ t offering . so the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
for the king had taken coun@@ sel , and his pr@@ inces , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation in Jer@@ usalem , to keep the pass@@ over in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the pri@@ ests had not sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jer@@ usalem .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h even un@@ to Ze@@ bul@@ un : but they la@@ ug@@ hed them to scor@@ n , and mo@@ cked them .
also in Ju@@ da@@ h the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king and of the pr@@ inces , by the word of the Lord .
and there assemb@@ led at Jer@@ usalem much people to keep the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread in the second month , a very great Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought in the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of the Lord .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Mos@@ es the man of God : the pri@@ ests sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for there were many in the Con@@ gre@@ gation that were not sanc@@ ti@@ fied : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes had the charge of the killing of the pass@@ overs for every one that was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them un@@ to the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jer@@ usalem kept the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days with great gla@@ d@@ ness : and the L@@ evi@@ tes and the pri@@ ests praised the Lord day by day , singing with l@@ oud instruments un@@ to the Lord .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h did give to the Con@@ gre@@ gation a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the Con@@ gre@@ gation a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation that came out of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ gers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
so there was great joy in Jer@@ usalem : for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jer@@ usalem .
then the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes ar@@ ose and b@@ les@@ sed the people : and their voice was heard , and their pray@@ er came up to his hol@@ y d@@ wel@@ ling place , even un@@ to heav@@ en .
moreover he comman@@ ded the people that d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem to give the portion of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the he@@ aps , and finished them in the seventh month .
and when H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah and the pr@@ inces came and saw the he@@ aps , they b@@ les@@ sed the Lord , and his people Israel .
then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah questioned with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes concerning the he@@ aps .
then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to prepare ch@@ ambers in the house of the Lord ; and they prepared them ,
and thus did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah throughout all Ju@@ da@@ h , and w@@ rought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God .
after these things , and the establishment there@@ of , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came , and entered into Ju@@ da@@ h , and en@@ camp@@ ed against the f@@ enced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah saw that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b was come , and that he was pur@@ posed to fight against Jer@@ usalem ,
he took coun@@ sel with his pr@@ inces and his m@@ igh@@ ty men to stop the waters of the fo@@ un@@ tains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous , be not afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , nor for all the multi@@ tude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of f@@ les@@ h ; but with us is the Lord our God to help us , and to fight our batt@@ les . and the people rested themselves upon the words of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
Do@@ th not H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you to give over yo@@ ur@@ selves to die by fam@@ ine and by thir@@ st , saying , The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations that my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' speech un@@ to the people of Jer@@ usalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and they sp@@ ake against the God of Jer@@ usalem , as against the go@@ ds of the people of the ear@@ th , which were the work of the hands of man .
and for this cause H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king , and the pro@@ phe@@ t I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , pray@@ ed and cri@@ ed to heav@@ en .
thus the Lord sav@@ ed H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and from the hand of all other , and gui@@ ded them on every side .
and many brought gifts un@@ to the Lord to Jer@@ usalem , and presents to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h : so that he was mag@@ ni@@ fied in the sight of all nations from th@@ en@@ ce@@ forth .
in those days H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah was si@@ ck to the death , and pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord : and he sp@@ ake un@@ to him , and he gave him a sign .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and honour : and he made himself treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all manner of pleas@@ ant je@@ wel@@ s ;
sto@@ re@@ houses also for the increase of cor@@ n , and wine , and oil ; and stal@@ ls for all manner of be@@ asts , and co@@ tes for f@@ loc@@ ks .
this same H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah also stopped the up@@ per water@@ course of G@@ ih@@ on , and brought it stra@@ ight down to the west side of the city of David . and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah prosp@@ ered in all his works .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty and five years in Jer@@ usalem :
but did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , like un@@ to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had broken down , and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al@@ im , and made gro@@ ves , and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served them .
also he built al@@ tar@@ s in the house of the Lord , where@@ of the Lord had said , In Jer@@ usalem shall my name be for ever .
and he built al@@ tar@@ s for all the host of heav@@ en in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
so Man@@ as@@ se@@ h made Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem to er@@ r , and to do worse than the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel .
and the Lord sp@@ ake to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and to his people : but they would not he@@ arken .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord brought upon them the cap@@ tains of the host of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , which took Man@@ as@@ se@@ h among the thor@@ ns , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and when he was in aff@@ li@@ ction , he bes@@ ought the Lord his God , and hum@@ b@@ led himself greatly before the God of his fa@@ thers ,
and pray@@ ed un@@ to him : and he was in@@ treated of him , and heard his supp@@ lic@@ ation , and brought him again to Jer@@ usalem into his k@@ ing@@ dom . then Man@@ as@@ se@@ h knew that the Lord he was God .
and he rep@@ aired the alt@@ ar of the Lord , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there@@ on peace offer@@ ings and than@@ k offer@@ ings , and comman@@ ded Ju@@ da@@ h to serve the Lord God of Israel .
Am@@ on was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem .
but he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father : for Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to all the car@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them ;
and hum@@ b@@ led not himself before the Lord , as Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had hum@@ b@@ led himself ; but Am@@ on t@@ res@@ passed more and more .
and his servants consp@@ ired against him , and sle@@ w him in his own house .
but the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem one and thirty years .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and so did he in the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Simeon , even un@@ to Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , with their mat@@ to@@ cks round about .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the work@@ men that w@@ rought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
even to the arti@@ fic@@ ers and buil@@ ders gave they it , to buy he@@ wn stone , and tim@@ ber for cou@@ pl@@ ings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h had destroyed .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found a book of the law of the Lord given by Mos@@ es .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to TH@@ Y servants , they do it .
then Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be told the king , saying , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est hat@@ h given me a book . and Sha@@ ph@@ an read it before the king .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h :
and as for the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , so shall ye say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
and he caused all that were present in Jer@@ usalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God , the God of their fa@@ thers .
moreover Jos@@ i@@ ah kept a pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord in Jer@@ usalem : and they killed the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the first month .
and he set the pri@@ ests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves by the houses of your fa@@ thers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the families of the fa@@ thers of your bre@@ th@@ ren the people , and after the division of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
so kill the pass@@ over , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , and prepare your bre@@ th@@ ren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
Con@@ an@@ i@@ ah also , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah and N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , his bre@@ th@@ ren , and Has@@ habi@@ ah and Je@@ i@@ el and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes , gave un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes for pass@@ over offer@@ ings five thousand small c@@ attle , and five hundred ox@@ en .
so the service was prepared , and the pri@@ ests stood in their place , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , according to the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
and they ro@@ asted the pass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other hol@@ y offer@@ ings so@@ d they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ edil@@ y among all the people .
so all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keep the pass@@ over , and to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of king Jos@@ i@@ ah .
after all this , when Jos@@ i@@ ah had prepared the temp@@ le , N@@ ech@@ o king of Egypt came up to fight against Car@@ chem@@ ish by E@@ up@@ h@@ rates : and Jos@@ i@@ ah went out against him .
and Jerem@@ i@@ ah lamen@@ ted for Jos@@ i@@ ah : and all the singing men and the singing women sp@@ ake of Jos@@ i@@ ah in their lament@@ ations to this day , and made them an ordin@@ ance in Israel : and , be@@ hold , they are written in the lament@@ ations .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and his Go@@ od@@ ness , according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
and his de@@ eds , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
then the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and made him king in his father 's stead in Jer@@ usalem .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord his God .
against him came up Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , to carry him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put them in his temp@@ le at Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months and ten days in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and when the year was expired , king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord his God , and hum@@ b@@ led not himself before Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t speaking from the m@@ outh of the Lord .
and he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart from turning un@@ to the Lord God of Israel .
moreover all the chief of the pri@@ ests , and the people , trans@@ g@@ ressed very much after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then ; and pollu@@ ted the house of the Lord which he had hal@@ low@@ ed in Jer@@ usalem .
and the Lord God of their fa@@ thers sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up be@@ times , and sending ; because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
but they mo@@ cked the mes@@ sen@@ gers of God , and desp@@ ised his words , and mis@@ used his pro@@ ph@@ ets , until the wr@@ ath of the Lord ar@@ ose against his people , ti@@ ll there was no re@@ medy .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces ; all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the house of God , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem , and bur@@ n@@ t all the pal@@ aces there@@ of with fire , and destroyed all the good@@ ly vessels there@@ of .
and them that had escaped from the s@@ word carried he away to Bab@@ yl@@ on ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia :
thus sa@@ ith Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , The Lord God of heav@@ en hat@@ h given me all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th ; and he hat@@ h charged me to build him an house at Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with be@@ asts , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , bes@@ ide all that was will@@ ingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar bring up with them of the cap@@ tivity that were brought up from Bab@@ yl@@ on un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .

the children of Uz@@ za , the children of Pas@@ e@@ ah , the children of Bes@@ ai ,
the children of As@@ n@@ ah , the children of Meh@@ un@@ im , the children of N@@ ep@@ hu@@ sim ,
the children of Bak@@ bu@@ k , the children of Hak@@ up@@ ha , the children of Har@@ hur ,

the children of B@@ ark@@ os , the children of Sis@@ era , the children of Th@@ am@@ ah ,

the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ uda ,
the children of Ja@@ al@@ ah , the children of D@@ ark@@ on , the children of G@@ id@@ del ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth of Z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of A@@ mi .
all the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred n@@ in@@ ety and two .
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred fif@@ ty and two .
and of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i ; which took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name :
these sought their register among those that were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as pollu@@ ted , put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a said un@@ to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , ti@@ ll there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and with Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation together was for@@ ty and two thousand three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ,
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jer@@ usalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
they gave after their ability un@@ to the treasure of the work thre@@ es@@ core and one thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and five thousand po@@ und of silver , and one hundred pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
they kept also the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les , as it is written , and offered the daily bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings by number , according to the cust@@ om , as the duty of every day required ;
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord . but the foundation of the temp@@ le of the Lord was not yet laid .
now when the ad@@ vers@@ aries of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin heard that the children of the cap@@ tivity buil@@ ded the temp@@ le un@@ to the Lord God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weak@@ ened the hands of the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , and troubled them in building ,
and hired coun@@ sel@@ lers against them , to fru@@ str@@ ate their purpose , all the days of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , even until the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us king of Per@@ sia .
and in the reign of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they un@@ to him an accus@@ ation against the inhabitants of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
this is the cop@@ y of the letter that they sent un@@ to him , even un@@ to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king ; Th@@ y servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dis@@ honour , therefore have we sent and certi@@ fied the king ;
there have been m@@ igh@@ ty kings also over Jer@@ usalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tri@@ bute , and cust@@ om , was paid un@@ to them .
give ye now comman@@ d@@ ment to cause these men to ce@@ ase , and that this city be not buil@@ ded , until another comman@@ d@@ ment shall be given from me .
take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
now when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went up in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
then ce@@ ased the work of the house of God which is at Jer@@ usalem . so it ce@@ ased un@@ to the second year of the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us king of Per@@ sia .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jer@@ usalem : and with them were the pro@@ ph@@ ets of God helping them .
then said we un@@ to them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
but the eye of their God was upon the el@@ ders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to ce@@ ase , ti@@ ll the matter came to Dar@@ i@@ us : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the cop@@ y of the letter that Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , which were on this side the river , sent un@@ to Dar@@ i@@ us the king :
they sent a letter un@@ to him , where@@ in was written thus ; un@@ to Dar@@ i@@ us the king , all peace .
we asked their names also , to certi@@ fy the@@ e , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en un@@ to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
but in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on the same king Cy@@ ru@@ s made a decree to build this house of God .
and said un@@ to him , T@@ ake these vessels , go , carry them into the temp@@ le that is in Jer@@ usalem , and let the house of God be buil@@ ded in his place .
then came the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now hat@@ h it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rol@@ ls , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of the Me@@ des , a rol@@ l , and there@@ in was a record thus written :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the el@@ ders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
that they may offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of swe@@ et sav@@ ours un@@ to the God of heav@@ en , and pra@@ y for the life of the king , and of his sons .
then Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and their compan@@ ions , according to that which Dar@@ i@@ us the king had sent , so they did spe@@ edil@@ y .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month Ad@@ ar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the king .
and they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
and the children of the cap@@ tivity kept the pass@@ over upon the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the first month .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified together , all of them were p@@ ure , and killed the pass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
and he came to Jer@@ usalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for E@@ z@@ ra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even a s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel .
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , a s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , which are min@@ ded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jer@@ usalem , go with the@@ e .
For@@ as@@ much as th@@ ou art sent of the king , and of his seven coun@@ sel@@ lers , to inqu@@ ire concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , according to the law of TH@@ Y God which is in th@@ ine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his coun@@ sel@@ lers have freely offered un@@ to the God of Israel , whose habi@@ tation is in Jer@@ usalem ,
and all the silver and gold that th@@ ou can@@ st find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem :
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall seem good to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
the vessels also that are given the@@ e for the service of the house of TH@@ Y God , those deliver th@@ ou before the God of Jer@@ usalem .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be dil@@ ig@@ ently done for the house of the God of heav@@ en : for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
these are now the chief of their fa@@ thers , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of them that went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
of the sons of Ph@@ ine@@ has ; Ger@@ sho@@ m : of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; H@@ att@@ ush .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of P@@ har@@ os@@ h ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah : and with him were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of the mal@@ es an hundred and fif@@ ty .
of the sons of Pah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ a@@ b ; Eli@@ ho@@ en@@ ai the son of Zer@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and with him two hundred mal@@ es .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah ; the son of Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el , and with him three hundred mal@@ es .
of the sons also of Ad@@ in ; E@@ bed the son of Jon@@ athan , and with him fif@@ ty mal@@ es .
and of the sons of E@@ lam ; J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah the son of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , and with him sev@@ enty mal@@ es .
and of the sons of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah ; Z@@ eb@@ adi@@ ah the son of Michael , and with him fo@@ ur@@ score mal@@ es .
of the sons of Jo@@ a@@ b ; Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , and with him two hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen mal@@ es .
and of the sons of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith ; the son of Josip@@ hi@@ ah , and with him an hundred and thre@@ es@@ core mal@@ es .
and of the sons of B@@ eb@@ ai ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of B@@ eb@@ ai , and with him twenty and eight mal@@ es .
and of the sons of Az@@ g@@ ad ; Johan@@ an the son of Hak@@ kat@@ an , and with him an hundred and ten mal@@ es .
and of the last sons of Ad@@ on@@ ik@@ am , whose names are these , Eli@@ phe@@ let , Je@@ i@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and with them thre@@ es@@ core mal@@ es .
of the sons also of B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai ; U@@ th@@ ai , and Z@@ ab@@ bu@@ d , and with them sev@@ enty mal@@ es .
and Has@@ habi@@ ah , and with him J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah of the sons of Mer@@ ari , his bre@@ th@@ ren and their sons , twenty ;
also of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , whom David and the pr@@ inces had appointed for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , two hundred and twenty N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims : all of them were expressed by name .
then I separated twelve of the chief of the pri@@ ests , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , Has@@ habi@@ ah , and ten of their bre@@ th@@ ren with them ,
I even weighed un@@ to their hand six hundred and fif@@ ty tal@@ ents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred tal@@ ents , and of gold an hundred tal@@ ents ;
and I said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are hol@@ y un@@ to the Lord ; the vessels are hol@@ y also ; and the silver and the gold are a fre@@ e@@ will offering un@@ to the Lord God of your fa@@ thers .
so took the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the house of our God .
by number and by weight of every one : and all the weight was written at that time .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down ast@@ on@@ ied .
and at the evening sacrifice I ar@@ ose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , I fell upon my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands un@@ to the Lord my God .
and said , O my God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to the@@ e , my God : for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities are increased over our head , and our t@@ res@@ pass is grown up un@@ to the heav@@ ens .
arise ; for this matter belon@@ get@@ h un@@ to the@@ e : we also will be with the@@ e : be of good courage , and do it .
then ar@@ ose E@@ z@@ ra , and made the chief pri@@ ests , the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all Israel , to swe@@ ar that they should do according to this word . and they sw@@ are .
and they made proc@@ lamation throughout Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem un@@ to all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together un@@ to Jer@@ usalem ;
now therefore make conf@@ ession un@@ to the Lord God of your fa@@ thers , and do his pleas@@ ure : and separate yo@@ ur@@ selves from the people of the land , and from the st@@ range wi@@ ves .
then all the Con@@ gre@@ gation answ@@ ered and said with a l@@ oud voice , As th@@ ou h@@ ast said , so must we do .
only Jon@@ athan the son of A@@ sah@@ el and Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah were employed about this matter : and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam and Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai the Lev@@ ite helped them .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves by the first day of the first month .
and among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found that had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves : name@@ ly , of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his bre@@ th@@ ren ; Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wi@@ ves ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their t@@ res@@ pass .
and of the sons of Im@@ mer ; Han@@ ani , and Z@@ eb@@ adi@@ ah .
and of the sons of Har@@ im ; Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ j@@ ah , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
and of the sons of P@@ ash@@ ur ; Eli@@ o@@ en@@ ai , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and E@@ las@@ ah .
also of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Ke@@ la@@ i@@ ah , ( the same is Kel@@ ita , ) P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , Ju@@ da@@ h , and Eli@@ ez@@ er .
of the singers also ; Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b : and of the por@@ ters ; S@@ hal@@ lum , and Tele@@ m , and U@@ ri .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Par@@ os@@ h ; Ram@@ i@@ ah , and J@@ ez@@ i@@ ah , and Mal@@ chi@@ ah , and Mi@@ amin , and Ele@@ azar , and Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah .
and of the sons of E@@ lam ; Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Ab@@ di , and Jerem@@ o@@ th , and Eli@@ ah .
and of the sons of Z@@ att@@ u ; Eli@@ o@@ en@@ ai , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , and Jerem@@ o@@ th , and Z@@ ab@@ ad , and Az@@ iza .
of the sons also of B@@ eb@@ ai ; Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , Z@@ ab@@ ba@@ i , and Ath@@ la@@ i .
and of the sons of Ban@@ i ; Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , Mal@@ lu@@ ch , and A@@ dai@@ ah , J@@ ash@@ u@@ b , and She@@ al , and Ram@@ o@@ th .
and of the sons of Pah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ a@@ b ; Ad@@ na , and C@@ he@@ lal , Ben@@ ai@@ ah , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el , and Bin@@ n@@ u@@ i , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
all these had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves : and some of them had wi@@ ves by whom they had children .
the words of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Hac@@ hali@@ ah . and it came to pass in the month Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year , as I was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
that Han@@ ani , one of my bre@@ th@@ ren , came , he and certain men of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
and they said un@@ to me , The re@@ mn@@ ant that are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great aff@@ li@@ ction and re@@ pro@@ ach : the wall of Jer@@ usalem also is broken down , and the gates there@@ of are burned with fire .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days , and fas@@ ted , and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
and said , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , O Lord God of heav@@ en , the great and ter@@ ri@@ ble God , that keep@@ eth C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and mer@@ cy for them that love him and observe his comman@@ d@@ ments :
we have dealt very cor@@ rup@@ tly against the@@ e , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ments , nor the stat@@ utes , nor the judg@@ ments , which th@@ ou comman@@ de@@ d@@ st TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Mos@@ es .
remember , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the word that th@@ ou comman@@ de@@ d@@ st TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Mos@@ es , saying , If ye trans@@ gress , I will sc@@ at@@ ter you abroad among the nations :
now these are TH@@ Y servants and TH@@ Y people , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed by TH@@ Y great power , and by TH@@ Y strong hand .
then I came to the govern@@ ors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ se@@ men with me .
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the gate of the fo@@ un@@ tain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the be@@ ast that was under me to pass .
and next un@@ to him buil@@ ded the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o . and next to them buil@@ ded Z@@ acc@@ ur the son of Im@@ ri .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
and next un@@ to them the Tek@@ o@@ ites rep@@ aired ; but their no@@ bles put not their nec@@ ks to the work of their Lord .
moreover the old gate rep@@ aired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , and the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , un@@ to the th@@ r@@ one of the governor on this side the river .
next un@@ to him rep@@ aired Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , of the gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths . next un@@ to him also rep@@ aired Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of one of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ aries , and they for@@ ti@@ fied Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the broad wall .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ur , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Jer@@ usalem .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Har@@ um@@ ap@@ h , even over against his house . and next un@@ to him rep@@ aired H@@ att@@ ush the son of Has@@ hab@@ ni@@ ah .
Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the son of Har@@ im , and H@@ ash@@ u@@ b the son of Pah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ a@@ b , rep@@ aired the other piece , and the to@@ wer of the fur@@ n@@ aces .
and next un@@ to him rep@@ aired S@@ hal@@ lum the son of H@@ alo@@ hes@@ h , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Jer@@ usalem , he and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
the val@@ ley gate rep@@ aired Han@@ un , and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah ; they built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of , and a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts on the wall un@@ to the D@@ ung gate .
and next to him rep@@ aired E@@ zer the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the ru@@ ler of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , another piece over against the going up to the ar@@ mo@@ ury at the turning of the wall .
after him Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Z@@ ab@@ ba@@ i ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly rep@@ aired the other piece , from the turning of the wall un@@ to the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est .
after him rep@@ aired Bin@@ n@@ u@@ i the son of Hen@@ ad@@ ad another piece , from the house of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah un@@ to the turning of the wall , even un@@ to the cor@@ ner .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h .
moreover the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims d@@ wel@@ t in O@@ ph@@ el , un@@ to the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the to@@ wer that li@@ eth out .
after them the Tek@@ o@@ ites rep@@ aired another piece , over against the great to@@ wer that li@@ eth out , even un@@ to the wall of O@@ ph@@ el .
after them rep@@ aired Zad@@ ok the son of Im@@ mer over against his house . after him rep@@ aired also Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah , the keep@@ er of the east gate .
after him rep@@ aired Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and Han@@ un the sixth son of Zal@@ ap@@ h , another piece . after him rep@@ aired Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah over against his chamber .
and between the going up of the cor@@ ner un@@ to the she@@ ep gate rep@@ aired the gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths and the mer@@ chan@@ ts .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we buil@@ ded the wall , he was wro@@ th , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
now To@@ bi@@ ah the Am@@ mon@@ ite was by him , and he said , E@@ ven that which they build , if a Fo@@ x go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
and cover not their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and let not their sin be blo@@ t@@ ted out from before the@@ e : for they have provoked the@@ e to an@@ ger before the buil@@ ders .
so built we the wall ; and all the wall was joined together un@@ to the half there@@ of : for the people had a mind to work .
nevertheless we made our pray@@ er un@@ to our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
and it came to pass , that when the Jews which d@@ wel@@ t by them came , they said un@@ to us ten times , From all places wh@@ ence ye shall return un@@ to us they will be upon you .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their bo@@ ws .
and it came to pass , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known un@@ to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one un@@ to his work .
they which buil@@ ded on the wall , and they that b@@ are bur@@ den@@ s , with those that la@@ ded , every one with one of his hands w@@ rought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the buil@@ ders , every one had his s@@ word gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , resort ye th@@ ither un@@ to us : our God shall fight for us .
so we la@@ b@@ oured in the work : and half of them held the spe@@ ars from the rising of the morning ti@@ ll the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I un@@ to the people , Let every one with his ser@@ vant lo@@ dge within Jer@@ usalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wi@@ ves against their bre@@ th@@ ren the Jews .
for there were that said , We , our sons , and our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , are many : therefore we take up cor@@ n for them , that we may eat , and live .
some also there were that said , We have mortg@@ aged our lands , v@@ ine@@ yards , and houses , that we might buy cor@@ n , because of the de@@ ar@@ th .
also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the re@@ pro@@ ach of the he@@ a@@ then our enem@@ ies ?
I likewise , and my bre@@ th@@ ren , and my servants , might exact of them money and cor@@ n : I pra@@ y you , let us leave off this us@@ ury .
Ye@@ a , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered th@@ ither un@@ to the work .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fif@@ ty of the Jews and rul@@ ers , bes@@ ide those that came un@@ to us from among the he@@ a@@ then that are about us .
think upon me , my God , for good , according to all that I have done for this people .
that San@@ bal@@ lat and G@@ es@@ hem sent un@@ to me , saying , C@@ ome , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the pla@@ in of O@@ no . but they thought to do me mis@@ chief .
yet they sent un@@ to me four times after this sort ; and I answ@@ ered them after the same manner .
then sent San@@ bal@@ lat his ser@@ vant un@@ to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ;
then I sent un@@ to him , saying , There are no such things done as th@@ ou say@@ est , but th@@ ou fe@@ ign@@ est them out of th@@ ine own heart .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month E@@ lu@@ l , in fif@@ ty and two days .
moreover in those days the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h sent many letters un@@ to To@@ bi@@ ah , and the letters of To@@ bi@@ ah came un@@ to them .
for there were many in Ju@@ da@@ h sworn un@@ to him , because he was the son in law of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Johan@@ an had taken the daughter of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the por@@ ters and the singers and the L@@ evi@@ tes were appointed ,
that I gave my brother Han@@ ani , and Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the ru@@ ler of the palace , charge over Jer@@ usalem : for he was a fa@@ ith@@ ful man , and fear@@ ed God above many .
now the city was large and great : but the people were few there@@ in , and the houses were not buil@@ ded .

the children of Ker@@ os , the children of S@@ ia , the children of Pad@@ on ,
the children of Le@@ bana , the children of Hag@@ ab@@ a , the children of S@@ hal@@ ma@@ i ,

the children of B@@ ark@@ os , the children of Sis@@ era , the children of Tam@@ ah ,

the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ ida ,
the children of Ja@@ ala , the children of D@@ ark@@ on , the children of G@@ id@@ del ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth of Z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of Am@@ on .
all the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred n@@ in@@ ety and two .
and these were they which went up also from Tel@@ me@@ lah , Tel@@ har@@ es@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ don , and Im@@ mer : but they could not she@@ w their father 's house , nor their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel .
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred for@@ ty and two .
and of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , which took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te to wife , and was called after their name .
these sought their register among those that were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as pollu@@ ted , put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a said un@@ to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , ti@@ ll there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation together was for@@ ty and two thousand three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ,
bes@@ ide their man@@ servants and their ma@@ id@@ servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred for@@ ty and five singing men and singing women .
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers gave un@@ to the work . the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a gave to the treasure a thousand dr@@ ams of gold , fif@@ ty bas@@ ons , five hundred and thirty pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred po@@ und of silver .
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and two thousand po@@ und of silver , and thre@@ es@@ core and seven pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
and E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est brought the law before the Con@@ gre@@ gation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
so they read in the book in the law of God distinc@@ tly , and gave the sense , and caused them to understand the reading .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes sti@@ l@@ led all the people , saying , H@@ old your peace , for the day is hol@@ y ; neither be ye gri@@ ev@@ ed .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared un@@ to them .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fa@@ thers of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to understand the words of the law .
and they found written in the law which the Lord had comman@@ ded by Mos@@ es , that the children of Israel should d@@ well in bo@@ o@@ ths in the feast of the seventh month :
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assemb@@ led with fas@@ ting , and with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th@@ es , and ear@@ th upon them .
and the se@@ ed of Israel separated themselves from all st@@ ran@@ gers , and stood and conf@@ essed their sin@@ s , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fa@@ thers .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord their God .
then stood up upon the st@@ airs , of the L@@ evi@@ tes , J@@ es@@ hua , and Ban@@ i , Kad@@ mi@@ el , She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , Bun@@ ni , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , Ban@@ i , and Chen@@ ani , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice un@@ to the Lord their God .
T@@ ho@@ u art the Lord the God , who di@@ d@@ st choose Ab@@ ram , and b@@ rough@@ test him forth out of U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and g@@ av@@ est him the name of Ab@@ ra@@ ham ;
and di@@ d@@ st see the aff@@ li@@ ction of our fa@@ thers in Egypt , and hear@@ dest their cry by the Red sea ;
and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and their persec@@ ut@@ ors th@@ ou thre@@ west into the deep@@ s , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover th@@ ou led@@ dest them in the day by a cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar ; and in the night by a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
T@@ ho@@ u ca@@ me@@ st down also upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , and sp@@ ak@@ est with them from heav@@ en , and g@@ av@@ est them right judg@@ ments , and true laws , good stat@@ utes and comman@@ d@@ ments :
and ma@@ dest known un@@ to them TH@@ Y hol@@ y sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and comman@@ de@@ d@@ st them prec@@ ep@@ ts , stat@@ utes , and laws , by the hand of Mos@@ es TH@@ Y ser@@ vant :
but they and our fa@@ thers dealt pro@@ u@@ dly , and har@@ dened their nec@@ ks , and hear@@ ken@@ ed not to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments ,
Ye@@ a , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , This is TH@@ Y God that brought the@@ e up out of Egypt , and had w@@ rought great provoc@@ ations ;
T@@ ho@@ u g@@ av@@ est also TH@@ Y good spirit to instruc@@ t them , and with@@ hel@@ dest not TH@@ Y man@@ na from their m@@ outh , and g@@ av@@ est them water for their thir@@ st .
Ye@@ a , for@@ ty years di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou sustain them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , so that they la@@ cked nothing ; their clo@@ th@@ es wa@@ xed not old , and their feet s@@ wel@@ led not .
their children also multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou as the stars of heav@@ en , and b@@ rough@@ test them into the land , concerning which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st promised to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
nevertheless they were dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent , and rebel@@ led against the@@ e , and cast TH@@ Y law behind their backs , and sle@@ w TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets which testified against them to turn them to the@@ e , and they w@@ rought great provoc@@ ations .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it th@@ ou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast done right , but we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly :
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept TH@@ Y law , nor hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments and TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , where@@ with th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st testify against them .
for they have not served the@@ e in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them , and in the large and f@@ at land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est before them , neither turned they from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
and it yi@@ el@@ de@@ th much increase un@@ to the kings whom th@@ ou h@@ ast set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have domin@@ ion over our bodies , and over our c@@ attle , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
now those that sealed were , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah , the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a , the son of Hac@@ hali@@ ah , and Z@@ id@@ k@@ ij@@ ah ,
and the L@@ evi@@ tes : both J@@ es@@ hua the son of A@@ zan@@ i@@ ah , Bin@@ n@@ u@@ i of the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , Kad@@ mi@@ el ;
and that we would not give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to the people of the land , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for our sons :
and to bring the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of our ground , and the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all fruit of all trees , year by year , un@@ to the house of the Lord :
and the rul@@ ers of the people d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem the hol@@ y city , and nine parts to d@@ well in other cities .
and the people b@@ les@@ sed all the men , that will@@ ingly offered themselves to d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Co@@ l @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sh@@ il@@ oni .
all the sons of Per@@ ez that d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem were four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and eight val@@ i@@ ant men .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ai@@ ah .
and Jo@@ el the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri was their over@@ se@@ er : and Ju@@ da@@ h the son of Sen@@ u@@ ah was second over the city .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , was the ru@@ ler of the house of God .
and his bre@@ th@@ ren , chief of the fa@@ thers , two hundred for@@ ty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , an hundred twenty and eight : and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of one of the great men .
also of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ash@@ u@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of Has@@ habi@@ ah , the son of Bun@@ ni ;
and Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , of the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had the over@@ sight of the ou@@ tw@@ ard business of the house of God .
all the L@@ evi@@ tes in the hol@@ y city were two hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and four .
and the resi@@ due of Israel , of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , were in all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , every one in his inher@@ it@@ ance .
for it was the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
and P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el , of the children of Zer@@ ah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
and at Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and at Mek@@ on@@ ah , and in the villages there@@ of ,
Z@@ ano@@ ah , Ad@@ ul@@ lam , and in their villages , at L@@ ach@@ ish , and the fields there@@ of , at Az@@ ek@@ ah , and in the villages there@@ of . and they d@@ wel@@ t from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba un@@ to the val@@ ley of Hin@@ no@@ m .
the children also of Benjamin from Ge@@ ba d@@ wel@@ t at Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , and A@@ ija , and Be@@ the@@ l , and in their villages ,
now these are the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes that went up with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and J@@ es@@ hua : Ser@@ ai@@ ah , Jerem@@ i@@ ah , E@@ z@@ ra ,
moreover the L@@ evi@@ tes : J@@ es@@ hua , Bin@@ n@@ u@@ i , Kad@@ mi@@ el , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , Ju@@ da@@ h , and Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , which was over the Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , he and his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im were pri@@ ests , the chief of the fa@@ thers : of Ser@@ ai@@ ah , Mer@@ ai@@ ah ; of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah ;
the sons of L@@ evi , the chief of the fa@@ thers , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be .
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the pla@@ in country round about Jer@@ usalem , and from the villages of Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ i ;
and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes pur@@ ified themselves , and pur@@ ified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , where@@ of one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the D@@ ung gate :
and after them went Hos@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and half of the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h ,
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets ; name@@ ly , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h :
and his bre@@ th@@ ren , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ a@@ el , Mil@@ al@@ ai , G@@ il@@ al@@ ai , Ma@@ ai , N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and Ju@@ da@@ h , Han@@ ani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be before them .
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rul@@ ers with me :
and both the singers and the por@@ ters kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the pur@@ ification , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David , and of Solomon his son .
for in the days of David and A@@ sap@@ h of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving un@@ to God .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ abi@@ te should not come into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Bal@@ a@@ am against them , that he should cur@@ se them : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it our God turned the cur@@ se into a b@@ les@@ sing .
now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multi@@ tude .
and before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the pri@@ est , having the over@@ sight of the chamber of the house of our God , was al@@ lied un@@ to To@@ bi@@ ah :
but in all this time was not I at Jer@@ usalem : for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came I un@@ to the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jer@@ usalem , and understood of the ev@@ il that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b did for To@@ bi@@ ah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
and it gri@@ ev@@ ed me sor@@ e : therefore I cast forth all the household stu@@ ff of To@@ bi@@ ah out of the chamber .
then I comman@@ ded , and they cleans@@ ed the ch@@ ambers : and th@@ ither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
and I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them : for the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
then conten@@ ded I with the rul@@ ers , and said , Wh@@ y is the house of God for@@ sak@@ en ? and I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wi@@ pe not out my good de@@ eds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices there@@ of .
there d@@ wel@@ t men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , which brought fish , and all manner of w@@ are , and sold on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath un@@ to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I conten@@ ded with the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said un@@ to them , What ev@@ il thing is this that ye do , and prof@@ ane the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
then I testified against them , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y lo@@ dge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
in those days also saw I Jews that had married wi@@ ves of Ash@@ do@@ d , of Am@@ mon , and of Mo@@ a@@ b :
and their children sp@@ ake half in the speech of Ash@@ do@@ d , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
and one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son in law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
remember them , O my God , because they have def@@ iled the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
thus cleans@@ ed I them from all st@@ ran@@ gers , and appointed the wards of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , every one in his business ;
now it came to pass in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us which re@@ ig@@ ned , from India even un@@ to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast un@@ to all his pr@@ inces and his servants ; the power of Per@@ sia and Media , the no@@ bles and pr@@ inces of the provinces , being before him :
when he she@@ wed the ri@@ ches of his g@@ lor@@ ious k@@ ing@@ dom and the honour of his excellent maj@@ es@@ ty many days , even an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score days .
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being di@@ verse one from another , ) and royal wine in ab@@ und@@ ance , according to the state of the king .
also V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
but the qu@@ een V@@ ash@@ ti refused to come at the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment by his ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins : therefore was the king very wro@@ th , and his an@@ ger burned in him .
then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , ( for so was the king 's manner toward all that knew law and judgment :
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his emp@@ ire , ( for it is great , ) all the wi@@ ves shall give to their hus@@ bands honour , both to great and small .
and the saying pleased the king and the pr@@ inces ; and the king did according to the word of Mem@@ uc@@ an :
after these things , when the wr@@ ath of king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us was appe@@ ased , he remember@@ ed V@@ ash@@ ti , and what she had done , and what was decre@@ ed against her .
now in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace there was a certain J@@ ew , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of K@@ ish , a Benj@@ am@@ ite ;
who had been carried away from Jer@@ usalem with the cap@@ tivity which had been carried away with J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away .
Es@@ ther had not she@@ wed her people nor her kin@@ d@@ red : for Mor@@ dec@@ ai had charged her that she should not she@@ w it .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai walked every day before the court of the women 's house , to know how Es@@ ther did , and what should become of her .
then thus came every ma@@ iden un@@ to the king ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the house of the women un@@ to the king 's house .
so Es@@ ther was taken un@@ to king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month Te@@ bet@@ h , in the seventh year of his reign .
and when the vir@@ g@@ ins were gathered together the second time , then Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate .
Es@@ ther had not yet she@@ wed her kin@@ d@@ red nor her people ; as Mor@@ dec@@ ai had charged her : for Es@@ ther did the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , like as when she was brought up with him .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , of those which kept the door , were wro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and the thing was known to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , who told it un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een ; and Es@@ ther certi@@ fied the king there@@ of in Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's name .
and when In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les before the king .
after these things did king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us promote Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the pr@@ inces that were with him .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bo@@ wed , and rever@@ enced Ham@@ an : for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence .
then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said un@@ to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Wh@@ y trans@@ gres@@ s@@ est th@@ ou the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment ?
and when Ham@@ an saw that Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence , then was Ham@@ an full of wr@@ ath .
and he thought scor@@ n to lay hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone ; for they had she@@ wed him the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai : where@@ fore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it un@@ to Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the Jews ' enemy .
and the king said un@@ to Ham@@ an , The silver is given to the@@ e , the people also , to do with them as it se@@ eme@@ th good to the@@ e .
the posts went out , being has@@ tened by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and the decree was given in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace . and the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city Sh@@ us@@ han was per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud and a bitter cry ;
and came even before the king 's gate : for none might enter into the king 's gate clo@@ th@@ ed with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th .
and in every province , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fas@@ ting , and we@@ eping , and w@@ ailing ; and many lay in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
so Es@@ ther 's ma@@ ids and her ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins came and told it her . then was the qu@@ een exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ im@@ ent to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th from him : but he received it not .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a comman@@ d@@ ment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
so Hat@@ ach went forth to Mor@@ dec@@ ai un@@ to the street of the city , which was before the king 's gate .
and Es@@ ther answ@@ ered , If it seem good un@@ to the king , let the king and Ham@@ an come this day un@@ to the ban@@ qu@@ et that I have prepared for him .
then the king said , C@@ ause Ham@@ an to make has@@ te , that he may do as Es@@ ther hat@@ h said . so the king and Ham@@ an came to the ban@@ qu@@ et that Es@@ ther had prepared .
and the king said un@@ to Es@@ ther at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , What is TH@@ Y petition ? and it shall be granted the@@ e : and what is TH@@ Y request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed .
then went Ham@@ an forth that day jo@@ y@@ ful and with a glad heart : but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of in@@ dign@@ ation against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
nevertheless Ham@@ an ref@@ ra@@ ined himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and Zer@@ es@@ h his wife .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sle@@ ep , and he comman@@ ded to bring the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les ; and they were read before the king .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai came again to the king 's gate . but Ham@@ an has@@ ted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , and has@@ ted to bring Ham@@ an un@@ to the ban@@ qu@@ et that Es@@ ther had prepared .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered and said , If I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
then the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een , Wh@@ o is he , and where is he , that dur@@ st pres@@ ume in his heart to do so ?
so they han@@ ged Ham@@ an on the gal@@ lows that he had prepared for Mor@@ dec@@ ai . then was the king 's wr@@ ath p@@ ac@@ ified .
on that day did the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us give the house of Ham@@ an the Jews ' enemy un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een . and Mor@@ dec@@ ai came before the king ; for Es@@ ther had told what he was un@@ to her .
and the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Ham@@ an , and gave it un@@ to Mor@@ dec@@ ai . and Es@@ ther set Mor@@ dec@@ ai over the house of Ham@@ an .
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
then the king held out the golden scep@@ tre toward Es@@ ther . so Es@@ ther ar@@ ose , and stood before the king ,
for how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the ev@@ il that shall come un@@ to my people ? or how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the destruction of my kin@@ d@@ red ?
and he wrote in the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on hor@@ se@@ back , and ri@@ ders on mu@@ les , ca@@ me@@ ls , and young dro@@ med@@ aries :
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , name@@ ly , upon the thir@@ teen@@ th day of the twel@@ f@@ th month , which is the month Ad@@ ar .
the cop@@ y of the writing for a comman@@ d@@ ment to be given in every province was published un@@ to all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
so the posts that ro@@ de upon mu@@ les and ca@@ me@@ ls went out , being has@@ tened and pressed on by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment . and the decree was given at Sh@@ us@@ han the palace .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could with@@ stand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
for Mor@@ dec@@ ai was great in the king 's house , and his f@@ ame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mor@@ dec@@ ai wa@@ xed greater and greater .
thus the Jews smo@@ te all their enem@@ ies with the stro@@ ke of the s@@ word , and sla@@ ughter , and destruction , and did what they would un@@ to those that ha@@ ted them .
and Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , and Dal@@ ph@@ on , and A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
on that day the number of those that were sla@@ in in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace was brought before the king .
then said Es@@ ther , If it ple@@ ase the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Sh@@ us@@ han to do tomorrow also according un@@ to this day 's decree , and let Ham@@ an 's ten sons be han@@ ged upon the gal@@ lows .
and the king comman@@ ded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Sh@@ us@@ han ; and they han@@ ged Ham@@ an 's ten sons .
for the Jews that were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and sle@@ w three hundred men at Sh@@ us@@ han ; but on the pre@@ y they laid not their hand .
on the thir@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar ; and on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same rested they , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gla@@ d@@ ness .
but the Jews that were at Sh@@ us@@ han assemb@@ led together on the thir@@ teen@@ th day there@@ of ; and on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th there@@ of ; and on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gla@@ d@@ ness .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai wrote these things , and sent letters un@@ to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , both n@@ igh and far ,
to st@@ ab@@ lish this among them , that they should keep the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar , and the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same , ye@@ arly ,
and the Jews under@@ took to do as they had begun , and as Mor@@ dec@@ ai had written un@@ to them ;
but when Es@@ ther came before the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een , the daughter of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il , and Mor@@ dec@@ ai the J@@ ew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of Pur@@ im .
and he sent the letters un@@ to all the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , with words of peace and truth ,
and the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us laid a tri@@ bute upon the land , and upon the is@@ les of the sea .
there was a man in the land of U@@ z , whose name was Jo@@ b ; and that man was perfect and u@@ pri@@ ght , and one that fear@@ ed God , and es@@ che@@ wed ev@@ il .
and his sons went and fe@@ asted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and S@@ atan came also among them .
and the Lord said un@@ to S@@ atan , be@@ hold , all that he hat@@ h is in TH@@ Y power ; only upon himself put not forth th@@ ine hand . so S@@ atan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
and there was a day when his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
and the Sab@@ e@@ ans fell upon them , and took them away ; ye@@ a , they have sla@@ in the servants with the edge of the s@@ word ; and I only am escaped alone to tell the@@ e .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Th@@ y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
then Jo@@ b ar@@ ose , and rent his man@@ tle , and sha@@ ved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and wor@@ shi@@ pped ,
again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and S@@ atan came also among them to present himself before the Lord .
and the Lord said un@@ to S@@ atan , From wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ? and S@@ atan answ@@ ered the Lord , and said , From going to and f@@ ro in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it .
so went S@@ atan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smo@@ te Jo@@ b with sor@@ e bo@@ ils from the sole of his fo@@ ot un@@ to his cro@@ wn .
and he took him a po@@ t@@ sh@@ er@@ d to scrap@@ e himself with@@ al ; and he sat down among the ashes .
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven n@@ ights , and none sp@@ ake a word un@@ to him : for they saw that his gri@@ ef was very great .
let the day per@@ ish where@@ in I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conce@@ ived .
let that day be d@@ ark@@ ness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light sh@@ ine upon it .
let d@@ ark@@ ness and the shadow of death st@@ ain it ; let a cl@@ oud d@@ well upon it ; let the black@@ ness of the day ter@@ ri@@ fy it .
as for that night , let d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize upon it ; let it not be joined un@@ to the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the tw@@ il@@ ight there@@ of be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the da@@ w@@ ning of the day :
because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nor hi@@ d sor@@ row from mine eyes .
why died I not from the w@@ om@@ b ? why did I not give up the gh@@ ost when I came out of the bel@@ ly ?
why did the k@@ ne@@ es prevent me ? or why the bre@@ asts that I should su@@ ck ?
for now should I have la@@ in still and been quiet , I should have sle@@ pt : then had I been at rest ,
or with pr@@ inces that had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
there the w@@ ic@@ ked ce@@ ase from troub@@ ling ; and there the we@@ ary be at rest .
there the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the op@@ pres@@ sor .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore is light given to him that is in mis@@ ery , and life un@@ to the bitter in sou@@ l ;
which long for death , but it co@@ me@@ th not ; and di@@ g for it more than for hi@@ d treasures ;
which re@@ jo@@ ice exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
for my si@@ gh@@ ing co@@ me@@ th before I eat , and my ro@@ ar@@ ings are p@@ oured out like the waters .
for the thing which I greatly fear@@ ed is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come un@@ to me .
if we as@@ say to commun@@ e with the@@ e , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou be gri@@ ev@@ ed ? but who can with@@ hold himself from speaking ?
TH@@ Y words have up@@ hol@@ den him that was falling , and th@@ ou h@@ ast strengthened the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es .
but now it is come upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou fa@@ in@@ test ; it tou@@ ch@@ eth the@@ e , and th@@ ou art troubled .
is not this TH@@ Y fear , TH@@ Y confidence , TH@@ Y hope , and the u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of TH@@ Y ways ?
remember , I pra@@ y the@@ e , who ever per@@ ished , being innocent ? or where were the righ@@ te@@ ous cut off ?
even as I have seen , they that plo@@ w in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and so@@ w w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , re@@ ap the same .
by the blast of God they per@@ ish , and by the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils are they consu@@ med .
the ro@@ aring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the te@@ eth of the young li@@ ons , are broken .
the old lion per@@ is@@ het@@ h for lack of pre@@ y , and the st@@ out lion 's whel@@ ps are sc@@ at@@ tered abroad .
fear came upon me , and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , which made all my b@@ ones to shake .
then a spirit passed before my face ; the ha@@ ir of my f@@ les@@ h stood up :
it stood still , but I could not dis@@ cer@@ n the form there@@ of : an image was before mine eyes , there was sil@@ ence , and I heard a voice , saying ,
be@@ hold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his an@@ gel@@ s he charged with Fol@@ ly :
how much less in them that d@@ well in houses of cla@@ y , whose foundation is in the d@@ ust , which are cr@@ us@@ hed before the mo@@ th ?
Do@@ th not their exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy which is in them go away ? they die , even without wis@@ dom .
call now , if there be any that will answer the@@ e ; and to which of the sa@@ ints w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn ?
his children are far from safety , and they are cr@@ us@@ hed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
although aff@@ li@@ ction co@@ me@@ th not forth of the d@@ ust , neither do@@ th trouble spring out of the ground ;
who gi@@ vet@@ h rain upon the ear@@ th , and sen@@ de@@ th waters upon the fields :
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mour@@ n may be ex@@ al@@ ted to safety .
he dis@@ appoin@@ te@@ th the devices of the craf@@ ty , so that their hands can@@ not perform their enterprise .
he tak@@ eth the wise in their own craf@@ tin@@ ess : and the coun@@ sel of the fro@@ ward is carried head@@ long .
they meet with d@@ ark@@ ness in the day@@ time , and gro@@ pe in the no@@ on@@ day as in the night .
but he sav@@ eth the poor from the s@@ word , from their m@@ outh , and from the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
in fam@@ ine he shall re@@ de@@ em the@@ e from death : and in war from the power of the s@@ word .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be hi@@ d from the s@@ cour@@ ge of the ton@@ gue : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou be afraid of destruction when it co@@ me@@ th .
at destruction and fam@@ ine th@@ ou s@@ halt la@@ ug@@ h : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou be afraid of the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt be in league with the stones of the field : and the be@@ asts of the field shall be at peace with the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ acle shall be in peace ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt visit TH@@ Y habi@@ tation , and s@@ halt not sin .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt know also that TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall be great , and th@@ ine off@@ spring as the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt come to TH@@ Y grave in a full age , like as a shock of cor@@ n co@@ me@@ th in in his season .
L@@ o this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know th@@ ou it for TH@@ Y good .
O@@ h that my gri@@ ef were throug@@ h@@ ly weighed , and my cal@@ am@@ ity laid in the balan@@ ces together !
for now it would be he@@ avier than the s@@ and of the sea : therefore my words are sw@@ allowed up .
for the ar@@ ro@@ ws of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty are within me , the po@@ ison where@@ of drin@@ ket@@ h up my spirit : the terr@@ ors of God do set themselves in array against me .
can that which is un@@ sav@@ our@@ y be e@@ aten without salt ? or is there any tas@@ te in the white of an eg@@ g ?
O@@ h that I might have my request ; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for !
even that it would ple@@ ase God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
what is my strength , that I should hope ? and what is mine end , that I should prol@@ ong my life ?
is not my help in me ? and is wis@@ dom driven quite from me ?
which are black@@ ish by reason of the ice , and where@@ in the snow is hi@@ d :
what time they wa@@ x warm , they van@@ ish : when it is hot , they are consu@@ med out of their place .
the p@@ aths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and per@@ ish .
did I say , Br@@ ing un@@ to me ? or , Gi@@ ve a reward for me of your sub@@ stance ?
te@@ ach me , and I will hold my ton@@ gue : and cause me to understand where@@ in I have er@@ red .
do ye imag@@ ine to re@@ prove words , and the spe@@ eches of one that is desper@@ ate , which are as wind ?
Ye@@ a , ye overwhel@@ m the fa@@ ther@@ less , and ye di@@ g a p@@ it for your friend .
return , I pra@@ y you , let it not be in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; ye@@ a , return again , my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in it .
is there not an appointed time to man upon ear@@ th ? are not his days also like the days of an hi@@ re@@ ling ?
as a ser@@ vant ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly desi@@ re@@ th the shadow , and as an hi@@ re@@ ling lo@@ ok@@ eth for the reward of his work :
so am I made to poss@@ ess months of van@@ ity , and we@@ ar@@ is@@ ome n@@ ights are appointed to me .
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tos@@ s@@ ings to and f@@ ro un@@ to the da@@ w@@ ning of the day .
my f@@ les@@ h is clo@@ th@@ ed with wor@@ ms and clo@@ ds of d@@ ust ; my s@@ kin is broken , and become lo@@ ath@@ some .
my days are swi@@ f@@ ter than a we@@ av@@ er 's shut@@ tle , and are spent without hope .
as the cl@@ oud is consu@@ med and van@@ is@@ het@@ h away : so he that go@@ eth down to the grave shall come up no more .
he shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
therefore I will not refrain my m@@ outh ; I will speak in the an@@ gu@@ ish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
when I say , My bed shall comfor@@ t me , my cou@@ ch shall ease my complaint ;
then th@@ ou scar@@ est me with dre@@ ams , and ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ est me through visions :
what is man , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest mag@@ ni@@ fy him ? and that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest set th@@ ine heart upon him ?
I have sin@@ ned ; what shall I do un@@ to the@@ e , O th@@ ou preser@@ ver of men ? why h@@ ast th@@ ou set me as a mark against the@@ e , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why dost th@@ ou not par@@ don my trans@@ gres@@ sion , and take away mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
how long w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou speak these things ? and how long shall the words of TH@@ Y m@@ outh be like a strong wind ?
if TH@@ Y children have sin@@ ned against him , and he have cast them away for their trans@@ gres@@ sion ;
if th@@ ou w@@ ert p@@ ure and u@@ pri@@ ght ; su@@ rely now he would aw@@ ake for the@@ e , and make the habi@@ tation of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness prosperous .
for inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , of the former age , and prepare th@@ y@@ self to the search of their fa@@ thers :
( for we are but of yes@@ ter@@ day , and know nothing , because our days upon ear@@ th are a shadow : )
shall not they te@@ ach the@@ e , and tell the@@ e , and ut@@ ter words out of their heart ?
wh@@ il@@ st it is yet in his green@@ ness , and not cut down , it with@@ er@@ eth before any other her@@ b .
he shall le@@ an upon his house , but it shall not stand : he shall hold it fast , but it shall not en@@ dur@@ e .
if he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , I have not seen the@@ e .
be@@ hold , this is the joy of his way , and out of the ear@@ th shall others grow .
be@@ hold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will he help the ev@@ il do@@ ers :
they that h@@ ate the@@ e shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame ; and the d@@ wel@@ ling place of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall come to n@@ ought .
he is wise in heart , and m@@ igh@@ ty in strength : who hat@@ h har@@ dened himself against him , and hat@@ h prosp@@ ered ?
which shak@@ eth the ear@@ th out of her place , and the pil@@ lars there@@ of tre@@ m@@ ble .
which comman@@ de@@ th the sun , and it ris@@ eth not ; and se@@ al@@ eth up the stars .
L@@ o , he go@@ eth by me , and I see him not : he pass@@ eth on also , but I perce@@ ive him not .
whom , though I were righ@@ te@@ ous , yet would I not answer , but I would make supp@@ lic@@ ation to my judge .
if I had called , and he had answ@@ ered me ; yet would I not believe that he had hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to my voice .
for he break@@ eth me with a temp@@ est , and multi@@ p@@ li@@ eth my wounds without cause .
he will not suffer me to take my bre@@ ath , but fil@@ le@@ th me with bit@@ ter@@ ness .
if I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to p@@ lead ?
if I justify myself , mine own m@@ outh shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me per@@ verse .
though I were perfect , yet would I not know my sou@@ l : I would desp@@ ise my life .
if the s@@ cour@@ ge s@@ lay su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , he will la@@ ug@@ h at the trial of the innocent .
the ear@@ th is given into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked : he cover@@ eth the faces of the judges there@@ of ; if not , where , and who is he ?
now my days are swi@@ f@@ ter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to the pre@@ y .
if I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heav@@ iness , and comfor@@ t myself :
I am afraid of all my sor@@ ro@@ ws , I know that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not hold me innocent .
if I was@@ h myself with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ;
yet s@@ halt th@@ ou plun@@ ge me in the di@@ t@@ ch , and mine own clo@@ th@@ es shall ab@@ h@@ or me .
for he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , and we should come together in judgment .
let him take his ro@@ d away from me , and let not his fear ter@@ ri@@ fy me :
my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
I will say un@@ to God , D@@ o not condemn me ; she@@ w me where@@ fore th@@ ou conten@@ dest with me .
is it good un@@ to the@@ e that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest op@@ press , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest desp@@ ise the work of th@@ ine hands , and sh@@ ine upon the coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked ?
that th@@ ou inqu@@ i@@ rest after mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and sear@@ ch@@ est after my sin ?
T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est that I am not w@@ ic@@ ked ; and there is none that can deliver out of th@@ ine hand .
remember , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , that th@@ ou h@@ ast made me as the cla@@ y ; and w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou bring me into d@@ ust again ?
and these things h@@ ast th@@ ou hi@@ d in th@@ ine heart : I know that this is with the@@ e .
if I sin , then th@@ ou mark@@ est me , and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not acqu@@ it me from mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
if I be w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e un@@ to me ; and if I be righ@@ te@@ ous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of conf@@ usion ; therefore see th@@ ou mine aff@@ li@@ ction ;
for it increas@@ eth . T@@ ho@@ u hun@@ test me as a fierce lion : and again th@@ ou she@@ west th@@ y@@ self mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous upon me .
T@@ ho@@ u rene@@ west TH@@ Y witnesses against me , and increas@@ est th@@ ine in@@ dign@@ ation upon me ; changes and war are against me .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then h@@ ast th@@ ou brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? O@@ h that I had given up the gh@@ ost , and no eye had seen me !
I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the w@@ om@@ b to the grave .
are not my days few ? ce@@ ase then , and let me alone , that I may take comfor@@ t a little ,
before I go wh@@ ence I shall not return , even to the land of d@@ ark@@ ness and the shadow of death ;
a land of d@@ ark@@ ness , as d@@ ark@@ ness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as d@@ ark@@ ness .
should TH@@ Y lies make men hold their peace ? and when th@@ ou mo@@ ck@@ est , shall no man make the@@ e as@@ ha@@ med ?
and that he would she@@ w the@@ e the secre@@ ts of wis@@ dom , that they are double to that which is ! know therefore that God exac@@ te@@ th of the@@ e less than th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity de@@ ser@@ vet@@ h .
it is as high as heav@@ en ; what can@@ st th@@ ou do ? deeper than hell ; what can@@ st th@@ ou know ?
the measure there@@ of is longer than the ear@@ th , and broader than the sea .
for he know@@ eth v@@ ain men : he se@@ eth w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess also ; will he not then consider it ?
if in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity be in th@@ ine hand , put it far away , and let not w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess d@@ well in TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
for then s@@ halt th@@ ou lift up TH@@ Y face without spot ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be ste@@ d@@ fast , and s@@ halt not fear :
because th@@ ou s@@ halt forget TH@@ Y mis@@ ery , and remember it as waters that pass away :
and th@@ ine age shall be clear@@ er than the no@@ on@@ day ; th@@ ou s@@ halt sh@@ ine forth , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as the morning .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt be secure , because there is hope ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g about the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt take TH@@ Y rest in safety .
also th@@ ou s@@ halt lie down , and none shall make the@@ e afraid ; ye@@ a , many shall make suit un@@ to the@@ e .
but the eyes of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall fail , and they shall not escape , and their hope shall be as the giving up of the gh@@ ost .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not in@@ fer@@ ior to you : ye@@ a , who know@@ eth not such things as these ?
I am as one mo@@ cked of his neighbour , who cal@@ le@@ th upon God , and he answ@@ er@@ eth him : the just u@@ pri@@ ght man is la@@ ug@@ hed to scor@@ n .
he that is ready to sli@@ p with his feet is as a lam@@ p desp@@ ised in the thought of him that is at ease .
but ask now the be@@ asts , and they shall te@@ ach the@@ e ; and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and they shall tell the@@ e :
or speak to the ear@@ th , and it shall te@@ ach the@@ e : and the fis@@ hes of the sea shall declare un@@ to the@@ e .
who know@@ eth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hat@@ h w@@ rought this ?
in whose hand is the sou@@ l of every living thing , and the bre@@ ath of all man@@ kind .
with the ancient is wis@@ dom ; and in length of days understanding .
be@@ hold , he break@@ eth down , and it can@@ not be built again : he shut@@ te@@ th up a man , and there can be no opening .
be@@ hold , he with@@ hol@@ de@@ th the waters , and they d@@ ry up : also he sen@@ de@@ th them out , and they over@@ turn the ear@@ th .
he remov@@ eth away the speech of the tru@@ st@@ y , and tak@@ eth away the understanding of the aged .
he discover@@ eth deep things out of d@@ ark@@ ness , and br@@ ing@@ eth out to light the shadow of death .
he tak@@ eth away the heart of the chief of the people of the ear@@ th , and ca@@ us@@ eth them to w@@ ander in a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where there is no way .
what ye know , the same do I know also : I am not in@@ fer@@ ior un@@ to you .
but ye are for@@ gers of lies , ye are all physi@@ cians of no value .
hear now my reas@@ oning , and he@@ arken to the p@@ lead@@ ings of my li@@ ps .
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mo@@ c@@ ket@@ h another , do ye so mo@@ ck him ?
hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do I take my f@@ les@@ h in my te@@ eth , and put my life in mine hand ?
be@@ hold now , I have ordered my cause ; I know that I shall be justified .
who is he that will p@@ lead with me ? for now , if I hold my ton@@ gue , I shall give up the gh@@ ost .
withdraw th@@ ine hand far from me : and let not TH@@ Y dre@@ ad make me afraid .
for th@@ ou wri@@ test bitter things against me , and mak@@ est me to poss@@ ess the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of my youth .
T@@ ho@@ u p@@ ut@@ test my feet also in the sto@@ cks , and lo@@ ok@@ est narro@@ w@@ ly un@@ to all my p@@ aths ; th@@ ou set@@ test a print upon the he@@ els of my feet .
he co@@ me@@ th forth like a f@@ lower , and is cut down : he fle@@ eth also as a shadow , and continu@@ eth not .
and dost th@@ ou open th@@ ine eyes upon such an one , and br@@ ing@@ est me into judgment with the@@ e ?
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with the@@ e , th@@ ou h@@ ast appointed his bo@@ unds that he can@@ not pass ;
turn from him , that he may rest , ti@@ ll he shall accomp@@ lish , as an hi@@ re@@ ling , his day .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will s@@ pro@@ ut again , and that the tender branch there@@ of will not ce@@ ase .
though the root there@@ of wa@@ x old in the ear@@ th , and the stock there@@ of die in the ground ;
but man di@@ eth , and was@@ te@@ th away : ye@@ a , man gi@@ vet@@ h up the gh@@ ost , and where is he ?
so man li@@ eth down , and ris@@ eth not : ti@@ ll the heav@@ ens be no more , they shall not aw@@ ake , nor be raised out of their sle@@ ep .
O that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest hide me in the grave , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest keep me secret , until TH@@ Y wr@@ ath be past , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
if a man die , shall he live again ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait , ti@@ ll my change come .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt call , and I will answer the@@ e : th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t have a desire to the work of th@@ ine hands .
my trans@@ gres@@ sion is sealed up in a bag , and th@@ ou se@@ west up mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and su@@ rely the mountain falling co@@ me@@ th to n@@ ought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
the waters wear the stones : th@@ ou w@@ ash@@ est away the things which grow out of the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th ; and th@@ ou destro@@ y@@ est the hope of man .
T@@ ho@@ u prev@@ ail@@ est for ever against him , and he pass@@ eth : th@@ ou chan@@ gest his coun@@ tenance , and sen@@ dest him away .
his sons come to honour , and he know@@ eth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perce@@ i@@ vet@@ h it not of them .
should he reason with un@@ profitable talk ? or with spe@@ eches where@@ with he can do no good ?
for TH@@ Y m@@ outh ut@@ ter@@ eth th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and th@@ ou choos@@ est the ton@@ gue of the craf@@ ty .
are the con@@ so@@ lations of God small with the@@ e ? is there any secret thing with the@@ e ?
why do@@ th th@@ ine heart carry the@@ e away ? and what do TH@@ Y eyes win@@ k at ,
that th@@ ou turn@@ est TH@@ Y spirit against God , and let@@ test such words go out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh ?
what is man , that he should be clean ? and he which is born of a woman , that he should be righ@@ te@@ ous ?
be@@ hold , he p@@ ut@@ te@@ th no trust in his sa@@ ints ; ye@@ a , the heav@@ ens are not clean in his sight .
I will she@@ w the@@ e , hear me ; and that which I have seen I will declare ;
which wise men have told from their fa@@ thers , and have not hi@@ d it :
the w@@ ic@@ ked man trav@@ ail@@ eth with p@@ ain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the op@@ pres@@ sor .
he believ@@ eth not that he shall return out of d@@ ark@@ ness , and he is w@@ aited for of the s@@ word .
he w@@ ander@@ eth abroad for bread , saying , W@@ here is it ? he know@@ eth that the day of d@@ ark@@ ness is ready at his hand .
trouble and an@@ gu@@ ish shall make him afraid ; they shall prev@@ ail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
he run@@ net@@ h upon him , even on his nec@@ k , upon the th@@ ick bos@@ ses of his bu@@ ck@@ lers :
because he cover@@ eth his face with his fat@@ ness , and mak@@ eth col@@ l@@ ops of f@@ at on his f@@ lan@@ ks .
and he d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in de@@ so@@ late cities , and in houses which no man inhabi@@ te@@ th , which are ready to become he@@ aps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his sub@@ stance continue , neither shall he prol@@ ong the perf@@ ection there@@ of upon the ear@@ th .
he shall not de@@ part out of d@@ ark@@ ness ; the fla@@ me shall d@@ ry up his branches , and by the bre@@ ath of his m@@ outh shall he go away .
it shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
he shall shake off his un@@ ri@@ pe gra@@ pe as the v@@ ine , and shall cast off his f@@ lower as the olive .
I also could speak as ye do : if your sou@@ l were in my sou@@ l 's stead , I could he@@ ap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
but I would strengthen you with my m@@ outh , and the moving of my li@@ ps should ass@@ wage your gri@@ ef .
though I speak , my gri@@ ef is not ass@@ w@@ aged : and though I for@@ bear , what am I eased ?
and th@@ ou h@@ ast filled me with wr@@ in@@ k@@ les , which is a witness against me : and my le@@ ann@@ ess rising up in me be@@ aret@@ h witness to my face .
he te@@ aret@@ h me in his wr@@ ath , who ha@@ te@@ th me : he gn@@ ash@@ eth upon me with his te@@ eth ; mine enemy shar@@ pen@@ eth his eyes upon me .
they have g@@ ap@@ ed upon me with their m@@ outh ; they have s@@ mit@@ ten me upon the che@@ ek re@@ pro@@ ach@@ fully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
God hat@@ h delivered me to the un@@ go@@ dly , and turned me over into the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
I was at ease , but he hat@@ h broken me as@@ under : he hat@@ h also taken me by my nec@@ k , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
his ar@@ chers comp@@ ass me round about , he cle@@ av@@ eth my re@@ ins as@@ under , and do@@ th not spar@@ e ; he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out my g@@ all upon the ground .
my face is f@@ oul with we@@ eping , and my ey@@ eli@@ ds is the shadow of death ;
also now , be@@ hold , my witness is in heav@@ en , and my record is on high .
O that one might p@@ lead for a man with God , as a man ple@@ ade@@ th for his neighbour !
when a few years are come , then I shall go the way wh@@ ence I shall not return .
are there not mo@@ c@@ kers with me ? and do@@ th not mine eye continue in their provoc@@ ation ?
he that speak@@ eth f@@ lat@@ tery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
he hat@@ h made me also a by@@ word of the people ; and af@@ ore@@ time I was as a tab@@ ret .
mine eye also is dim by reason of sor@@ row , and all my members are as a shadow .
u@@ pri@@ ght men shall be ast@@ on@@ ied at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite .
the righ@@ te@@ ous also shall hold on his way , and he that hat@@ h clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
but as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for I can@@ not find one wise man among you .
my days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the th@@ ou@@ ghts of my heart .
if I wait , the grave is mine house : I have made my bed in the d@@ ark@@ ness .
I have said to corruption , T@@ ho@@ u art my father : to the wor@@ m , T@@ ho@@ u are my mother , and my sister .
how long will it be ER@@ E ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
he te@@ aret@@ h himself in his an@@ ger : shall the ear@@ th be for@@ sak@@ en for the@@ e ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
Ye@@ a , the light of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put out , and the spark of his fire shall not sh@@ ine .
the light shall be dark in his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and his cand@@ le shall be put out with him .
the steps of his strength shall be stra@@ it@@ ened , and his own coun@@ sel shall cast him down .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walk@@ eth upon a sn@@ are .
the gin shall take him by the he@@ el , and the rob@@ ber shall prev@@ ail against him .
the sn@@ are is laid for him in the ground , and a tra@@ p for him in the way .
Terr@@ ors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him to his feet .
it shall dev@@ our the strength of his s@@ kin : even the fir@@ st@@ born of death shall dev@@ our his strength .
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and it shall bring him to the king of terr@@ ors .
it shall d@@ well in his tab@@ ern@@ acle , because it is none of his : bri@@ m@@ stone shall be sc@@ at@@ tered upon his habi@@ tation .
his roots shall be dri@@ ed up ben@@ e@@ ath , and above shall his branch be cut off .
his re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance shall per@@ ish from the ear@@ th , and he shall have no name in the street .
he shall be driven from light into d@@ ark@@ ness , and ch@@ ased out of the world .
they that come after him shall be ast@@ on@@ ied at his day , as they that went before were aff@@ righ@@ ted .
these ten times have ye re@@ pro@@ ached me : ye are not as@@ ha@@ med that ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves st@@ range to me .
and be it indeed that I have er@@ red , mine er@@ ror remain@@ eth with myself .
he hat@@ h f@@ enced up my way that I can@@ not pass , and he hat@@ h set d@@ ark@@ ness in my p@@ aths .
he hat@@ h stri@@ pped me of my gl@@ ory , and taken the cro@@ wn from my head .
he hat@@ h destroyed me on every side , and I am gone : and mine hope hat@@ h he removed like a tree .
he hat@@ h also kin@@ d@@ led his wr@@ ath against me , and he coun@@ te@@ th me un@@ to him as one of his enem@@ ies .
he hat@@ h put my bre@@ th@@ ren far from me , and mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance are veril@@ y es@@ tran@@ ged from me .
they that d@@ well in mine house , and my ma@@ ids , count me for a st@@ ran@@ ger : I am an ali@@ en in their sight .
I called my ser@@ vant , and he gave me no answer ; I in@@ treated him with my m@@ outh .
my bre@@ ath is st@@ range to my wife , though I in@@ treated for the children 's sake of mine own body .
all my in@@ ward friends ab@@ hor@@ red me : and they whom I lov@@ ed are turned against me .
my bone cle@@ av@@ eth to my s@@ kin and to my f@@ les@@ h , and I am escaped with the s@@ kin of my te@@ eth .
have p@@ ity upon me , have p@@ ity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hat@@ h touched me .
O@@ h that my words were now written ! O@@ h that they were prin@@ ted in a book !
for I know that my re@@ de@@ e@@ mer li@@ vet@@ h , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the ear@@ th :
and though after my s@@ kin wor@@ ms destroy this body , yet in my f@@ les@@ h shall I see God :
whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall be@@ hold , and not another ; though my re@@ ins be consu@@ med within me .
but ye should say , Wh@@ y persec@@ ute we him , seeing the root of the matter is found in me ?
be ye afraid of the s@@ word : for wr@@ ath br@@ ing@@ eth the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the s@@ word , that ye may know there is a judgment .
I have heard the check of my re@@ pro@@ ach , and the spirit of my understanding ca@@ us@@ eth me to answer .
that the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing of the w@@ ic@@ ked is short , and the joy of the hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite but for a moment ?
though his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy mount up to the heav@@ ens , and his head reach un@@ to the cl@@ ou@@ ds ;
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : ye@@ a , he shall be ch@@ ased away as a vision of the night .
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more be@@ hold him .
his b@@ ones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the d@@ ust .
though he spar@@ e it , and for@@ sake it not ; but keep it still within his m@@ outh :
yet his meat in his bo@@ wel@@ s is turned , it is the g@@ all of as@@ ps within him .
he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed down ri@@ ches , and he shall v@@ om@@ it them up again : God shall cast them out of his bel@@ ly .
he shall su@@ ck the po@@ ison of as@@ ps : the vi@@ per 's ton@@ gue shall s@@ lay him .
he shall not see the rivers , the floods , the bro@@ oks of hon@@ ey and but@@ ter .
that which he la@@ b@@ oured for shall he restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down : according to his sub@@ stance shall the restitution be , and he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice there@@ in .
because he hat@@ h op@@ pressed and hat@@ h for@@ sak@@ en the poor ; because he hat@@ h viol@@ ently taken away an house which he buil@@ ded not ;
su@@ rely he shall not feel qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness in his bel@@ ly , he shall not save of that which he desi@@ red .
there shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
in the ful@@ ness of his suffici@@ ency he shall be in stra@@ its : every hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall come upon him .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God shall cast the fur@@ y of his wr@@ ath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is e@@ ating .
he shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bo@@ w of steel shall strike him through .
it is drawn , and co@@ me@@ th out of the body ; ye@@ a , the g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word co@@ me@@ th out of his g@@ all : terr@@ ors are upon him .
all d@@ ark@@ ness shall be hi@@ d in his secret places : a fire not blo@@ wn shall consum@@ e him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tab@@ ern@@ acle .
the heav@@ en shall reveal his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; and the ear@@ th shall rise up against him .
the increase of his house shall de@@ part , and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wr@@ ath .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
mark me , and be ast@@ on@@ ished , and lay your hand upon your m@@ outh .
even when I remember I am afraid , and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling tak@@ eth hold on my f@@ les@@ h .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do the w@@ ic@@ ked live , become old , ye@@ a , are m@@ igh@@ ty in power ?
their se@@ ed is established in their sight with them , and their off@@ spring before their eyes .
they send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
L@@ o , their good is not in their hand : the coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked is far from me .
how of@@ t is the cand@@ le of the w@@ ic@@ ked put out ! and how of@@ t co@@ me@@ th their destruction upon them ! God distribu@@ te@@ th sor@@ ro@@ ws in his an@@ ger .
his eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wr@@ ath of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
for what pleas@@ ure hat@@ h he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the mid@@ st ?
his bre@@ asts are full of milk , and his b@@ ones are mo@@ ist@@ ened with mar@@ row .
they shall lie down alike in the d@@ ust , and the wor@@ ms shall cover them .
for ye say , W@@ here is the house of the pr@@ ince ? and where are the d@@ wel@@ ling places of the w@@ ic@@ ked ?
have ye not asked them that go by the way ? and do ye not know their to@@ ken@@ s ,
that the w@@ ic@@ ked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wr@@ ath .
who shall declare his way to his face ? and who shall repay him what he hat@@ h done ?
yet shall he be brought to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
the clo@@ ds of the val@@ ley shall be swe@@ et un@@ to him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are in@@ num@@ er@@ able before him .
is it any pleas@@ ure to the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , that th@@ ou art righ@@ te@@ ous ? or is it gain to him that th@@ ou mak@@ est TH@@ Y ways perfect ?
will he re@@ prove the@@ e for fear of the@@ e ? will he enter with the@@ e into judgment ?
for th@@ ou h@@ ast taken a pledge from TH@@ Y brother for n@@ ought , and stri@@ pped the nak@@ ed of their clo@@ thing .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast not given water to the we@@ ary to drink , and th@@ ou h@@ ast with@@ hol@@ den bread from the hun@@ gry .
but as for the m@@ igh@@ ty man , he had the ear@@ th ; and the honour@@ able man d@@ wel@@ t in it .
T@@ ho@@ u has sent wi@@ dows away empty , and the arms of the fa@@ ther@@ less have been broken .
is not God in the he@@ ight of heav@@ en ? and be@@ hold the he@@ ight of the stars , how high they are !
th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds are a covering to him , that he se@@ eth not ; and he walk@@ eth in the cir@@ cu@@ it of heav@@ en .
whereas our sub@@ stance is not cut down , but the re@@ mn@@ ant of them the fire consu@@ me@@ th .
acqu@@ ain@@ t now th@@ y@@ self with him , and be at peace : there@@ by good shall come un@@ to the@@ e .
receive , I pra@@ y the@@ e , the law from his m@@ outh , and lay up his words in th@@ ine heart .
if th@@ ou return to the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , th@@ ou s@@ halt be built up , th@@ ou s@@ halt put away in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity far from TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou lay up gold as d@@ ust , and the gold of Op@@ hir as the stones of the bro@@ oks .
Ye@@ a , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty shall be TH@@ Y defence , and th@@ ou s@@ halt have plenty of silver .
for then s@@ halt th@@ ou have TH@@ Y de@@ light in the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , and s@@ halt lift up TH@@ Y face un@@ to God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt make TH@@ Y pray@@ er un@@ to him , and he shall hear the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pay TH@@ Y vows .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also decree a thing , and it shall be established un@@ to the@@ e : and the light shall sh@@ ine upon TH@@ Y ways .
when men are cast down , then th@@ ou s@@ halt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the hum@@ ble person .
O@@ h that I knew where I might find him ! that I might come even to his seat !
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say un@@ to me .
will he p@@ lead against me with his great power ? no ; but he would put strength in me .
be@@ hold , I go forward , but he is not there ; and back@@ ward , but I can@@ not perce@@ ive him :
on the left hand , where he do@@ th work , but I can@@ not be@@ hold him : he hi@@ de@@ th himself on the right hand , that I can@@ not see him :
but he know@@ eth the way that I take : when he hat@@ h tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
my fo@@ ot hat@@ h held his steps , his way have I kept , and not declined .
neither have I gone back from the comman@@ d@@ ment of his li@@ ps ; I have es@@ te@@ emed the words of his m@@ outh more than my necessary food .
but he is in one mind , and who can turn him ? and what his sou@@ l desi@@ re@@ th , even that he do@@ eth .
for he perfor@@ me@@ th the thing that is appointed for me : and many such things are with him .
therefore am I troubled at his presence : when I consider , I am afraid of him .
because I was not cut off before the d@@ ark@@ ness , neither hat@@ h he covered the d@@ ark@@ ness from my face .
some remove the land@@ marks ; they viol@@ ently take away f@@ loc@@ ks , and fe@@ ed there@@ of .
they drive away the ass of the fa@@ ther@@ less , they take the wi@@ dow 's o@@ x for a pledge .
they turn the ne@@ edy out of the way : the poor of the ear@@ th hide themselves together .
be@@ hold , as wild ass@@ es in the de@@ sert , go they forth to their work ; rising be@@ times for a pre@@ y : the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness yi@@ el@@ de@@ th food for them and for their children .
they re@@ ap every one his cor@@ n in the field : and they gather the vin@@ t@@ age of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
they cause the nak@@ ed to lo@@ dge without clo@@ thing , that they have no covering in the cold .
they are w@@ et with the sho@@ wers of the mountains , and em@@ br@@ ace the rock for want of a shelter .
they p@@ lu@@ ck the fa@@ ther@@ less from the bre@@ ast , and take a pledge of the poor .
they cause him to go nak@@ ed without clo@@ thing , and they take away the she@@ af from the hun@@ gry ;
men gro@@ an from out of the city , and the sou@@ l of the wounded cri@@ eth out : yet God lay@@ eth not Fol@@ ly to them .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways there@@ of , nor abide in the p@@ aths there@@ of .
the eye also of the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ er w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the tw@@ il@@ ight , saying , No eye shall see me : and dis@@ gu@@ is@@ eth his face .
in the dark they di@@ g through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the day@@ time : they know not the light .
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terr@@ ors of the shadow of death .
the w@@ om@@ b shall forget him ; the wor@@ m shall fe@@ ed swe@@ et@@ ly on him ; he shall be no more remember@@ ed ; and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess shall be broken as a tree .
he dra@@ w@@ eth also the m@@ igh@@ ty with his power : he ris@@ eth up , and no man is sure of life .
though it be given him to be in safety , where@@ on he res@@ te@@ th ; yet his eyes are upon their ways .
is there any number of his armies ? and upon whom do@@ th not his light arise ?
how then can man be justified with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
be@@ hold even to the moon , and it sh@@ in@@ eth not ; ye@@ a , the stars are not p@@ ure in his sight .
how h@@ ast th@@ ou helped him that is without power ? how sav@@ est th@@ ou the arm that hat@@ h no strength ?
how h@@ ast th@@ ou coun@@ sel@@ led him that hat@@ h no wis@@ dom ? and how h@@ ast th@@ ou plen@@ ti@@ fully declared the thing as it is ?
he bin@@ de@@ th up the waters in his th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds ; and the cl@@ oud is not rent under them .
he hol@@ de@@ th back the face of his th@@ r@@ one , and sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th his cl@@ oud upon it .
he hat@@ h comp@@ ass@@ ed the waters with bo@@ unds , until the day and night come to an end .
L@@ o , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ? but the Th@@ under of his power who can understand ?
all the while my bre@@ ath is in me , and the spirit of God is in my nos@@ tr@@ ils ;
God for@@ bid that I should justify you : ti@@ ll I die I will not remove mine integrity from me .
my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness I hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not re@@ pro@@ ach me so long as I live .
let mine enemy be as the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he that ris@@ eth up against me as the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous .
for what is the hope of the hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite , though he hat@@ h gained , when God tak@@ eth away his sou@@ l ?
I will te@@ ach you by the hand of God : that which is with the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty will I not conce@@ al .
this is the portion of a w@@ ic@@ ked man with God , and the heritage of op@@ pres@@ sors , which they shall receive of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
if his children be multi@@ p@@ lied , it is for the s@@ word : and his off@@ spring shall not be satisfied with bread .
those that remain of him shall be buried in death : and his wi@@ dows shall not we@@ ep .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he open@@ eth his eyes , and he is not .
Terr@@ ors take hold on him as waters , a temp@@ est ste@@ al@@ eth him away in the night .
the east wind carri@@ eth him away , and he depar@@ te@@ th : and as a storm hur@@ le@@ th him out of his place .
for God shall cast upon him , and not spar@@ e : he would fa@@ in flee out of his hand .
iron is taken out of the ear@@ th , and br@@ ass is m@@ ol@@ ten out of the stone .
he set@@ te@@ th an end to d@@ ark@@ ness , and sear@@ ch@@ eth out all perf@@ ection : the stones of d@@ ark@@ ness , and the shadow of death .
the flood break@@ eth out from the inhabi@@ tant ; even the waters forgotten of the fo@@ ot : they are dri@@ ed up , they are gone away from men .
as for the ear@@ th , out of it co@@ me@@ th bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
the stones of it are the place of sap@@ p@@ hi@@ res : and it hat@@ h d@@ ust of gold .
there is a path which no fo@@ w@@ l know@@ eth , and which the vul@@ ture 's eye hat@@ h not seen :
the lion 's whel@@ ps have not tro@@ dden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it .
he bin@@ de@@ th the floods from over@@ flow@@ ing ; and the thing that is hi@@ d br@@ ing@@ eth he forth to light .
but where shall wis@@ dom be found ? and where is the place of understanding ?
man know@@ eth not the price there@@ of ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
it can@@ not be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for the price there@@ of .
it can@@ not be valued with the gold of Op@@ hir , with the pre@@ ci@@ ous ony@@ x , or the sap@@ ph@@ ire .
the gold and the cr@@ y@@ st@@ al can@@ not equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for je@@ wel@@ s of fine gold .
no mention shall be made of cor@@ al , or of pe@@ ar@@ ls : for the price of wis@@ dom is above ru@@ bies .
seeing it is hi@@ d from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air .
to make the weight for the winds ; and he weigh@@ eth the waters by measure .
when he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the ligh@@ t@@ ning of the Th@@ under :
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , ye@@ a , and searched it out .
when his cand@@ le sh@@ ined upon my head , and when by his light I walked through d@@ ark@@ ness ;
as I was in the days of my youth , when the secret of God was upon my tab@@ ern@@ acle ;
when I was@@ hed my steps with but@@ ter , and the rock p@@ oured me out rivers of oil ;
when I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
the young men saw me , and hi@@ d themselves : and the aged ar@@ ose , and stood up .
the no@@ bles held their peace , and their ton@@ gue cle@@ av@@ ed to the ro@@ of of their m@@ outh .
when the e@@ ar heard me , then it b@@ les@@ sed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
because I delivered the poor that cri@@ ed , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and him that had none to help him .
the b@@ les@@ sing of him that was ready to per@@ ish came upon me : and I caused the wi@@ dow 's heart to sing for joy .
I put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and it clo@@ th@@ ed me : my judgment was as a ro@@ be and a di@@ ade@@ m .
I was eyes to the b@@ lin@@ d , and feet was I to the la@@ me .
I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
and I br@@ ake the j@@ a@@ ws of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and p@@ lu@@ cked the sp@@ oil out of his te@@ eth .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
my gl@@ ory was fresh in me , and my bo@@ w was renewed in my hand .
and they w@@ aited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their m@@ outh wide as for the latter rain .
if I la@@ ug@@ hed on them , they believed it not ; and the light of my coun@@ tenance they cast not down .
I chose out their way , and sat chief , and d@@ wel@@ t as a king in the army , as one that comfor@@ te@@ th the mour@@ ners .
but now they that are younger than I have me in der@@ ision , whose fa@@ thers I would have dis@@ da@@ ined to have set with the do@@ gs of my flock .
Ye@@ a , where@@ to might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom old age was per@@ ished ?
who cut up mal@@ lows by the bus@@ hes , and jun@@ ip@@ er roots for their meat .
they were driven forth from among men , ( they cri@@ ed after them as after a th@@ i@@ ef ; )
to d@@ well in the c@@ lif@@ ts of the val@@ ley@@ s , in c@@ aves of the ear@@ th , and in the ro@@ cks .
they were children of fo@@ ols , ye@@ a , children of base men : they were v@@ iler than the ear@@ th .
they ab@@ h@@ or me , they flee far from me , and spar@@ e not to sp@@ it in my face .
because he hat@@ h lo@@ os@@ ed my cor@@ d , and aff@@ lic@@ ted me , they have also let loose the bri@@ dle before me .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the de@@ so@@ lation they rol@@ led themselves upon me .
Terr@@ ors are turned upon me : they pursue my sou@@ l as the wind : and my welfare pass@@ eth away as a cl@@ oud .
and now my sou@@ l is p@@ oured out upon me ; the days of aff@@ li@@ ction have taken hold upon me .
my b@@ ones are pi@@ er@@ ced in me in the night season : and my sin@@ ews take no rest .
by the great force of my disease is my gar@@ ment changed : it bin@@ de@@ th me about as the col@@ lar of my co@@ at .
he hat@@ h cast me into the m@@ ire , and I am become like d@@ ust and ashes .
I cry un@@ to the@@ e , and th@@ ou dost not hear me : I stand up , and th@@ ou regar@@ dest me not .
T@@ ho@@ u art become cru@@ el to me : with TH@@ Y strong hand th@@ ou oppos@@ est th@@ y@@ self against me .
T@@ ho@@ u lif@@ test me up to the wind ; th@@ ou ca@@ us@@ est me to ride upon it , and dis@@ sol@@ v@@ est my sub@@ stance .
for I know that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
did not I we@@ ep for him that was in trouble ? was not my sou@@ l gri@@ ev@@ ed for the poor ?
when I looked for good , then ev@@ il came un@@ to me : and when I w@@ aited for light , there came d@@ ark@@ ness .
I am a brother to dra@@ g@@ ons , and a compan@@ ion to ow@@ ls .
my s@@ kin is black upon me , and my b@@ ones are burned with heat .
my har@@ p also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that we@@ ep .
I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with mine eyes ; why then should I think upon a ma@@ id ?
is not destruction to the w@@ ic@@ ked ? and a st@@ range punishment to the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ?
let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know mine integrity .
if my step hat@@ h turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blo@@ t hat@@ h cle@@ av@@ ed to mine hands ;
then let me so@@ w , and let another eat ; ye@@ a , let my off@@ spring be rooted out .
if mine heart have been dec@@ e@@ ived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour 's door ;
then let my wife gr@@ ind un@@ to another , and let others bo@@ w down upon her .
for this is an he@@ in@@ ous crime ; ye@@ a , it is an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judges .
if I did desp@@ ise the cause of my man@@ ser@@ vant or of my ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , when they conten@@ ded with me ;
what then shall I do when God ris@@ eth up ? and when he visi@@ te@@ th , what shall I answer him ?
if I have with@@ held the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the wi@@ dow to fail ;
or have e@@ aten my mor@@ sel myself alone , and the fa@@ ther@@ less hat@@ h not e@@ aten there@@ of ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have gui@@ ded her from my mother 's w@@ om@@ b ; )
if his lo@@ ins have not b@@ les@@ sed me , and if he were not war@@ med with the F@@ le@@ ece of my she@@ ep ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fa@@ ther@@ less , when I saw my help in the gate :
then let mine arm fall from my sho@@ ul@@ der bla@@ de , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
for destruction from God was a terror to me , and by reason of his high@@ ness I could not en@@ dur@@ e .
if I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ;
this also were an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judge : for I should have denied the God that is above .
if I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the destruction of him that ha@@ ted me , or lifted up myself when ev@@ il found him :
neither have I suffered my m@@ outh to sin by w@@ ishing a cur@@ se to his sou@@ l .
if the men of my tab@@ ern@@ acle said not , O@@ h that we had of his f@@ les@@ h ! we can@@ not be satisfied .
the st@@ ran@@ ger did not lo@@ dge in the street : but I opened my doors to the travel@@ ler .
su@@ rely I would take it upon my sho@@ ul@@ der , and bin@@ d it as a cro@@ wn to me .
I would declare un@@ to him the number of my steps ; as a pr@@ ince would I go near un@@ to him .
if I have e@@ aten the fru@@ its there@@ of without money , or have caused the owners there@@ of to lose their life :
then was kin@@ d@@ led the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite , of the kin@@ d@@ red of R@@ am : against Jo@@ b was his wr@@ ath kin@@ d@@ led , because he justified himself rather than God .
also against his three friends was his wr@@ ath kin@@ d@@ led , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Jo@@ b .
and Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite answ@@ ered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; where@@ fore I was afraid , and dur@@ st not she@@ w you mine opinion .
but there is a spirit in man : and the in@@ spir@@ ation of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty gi@@ vet@@ h them understanding .
be@@ hold , I w@@ aited for your words ; I gave e@@ ar to your reasons , wh@@ il@@ st ye searched out what to say .
Ye@@ a , I attended un@@ to you , and , be@@ hold , there was none of you that convinced Jo@@ b , or that answ@@ ered his words :
when I had w@@ aited , ( for they sp@@ ake not , but stood still , and answ@@ ered no more ; )
I said , I will answer also my part , I also will she@@ w mine opinion .
be@@ hold , my bel@@ ly is as wine which hat@@ h no v@@ ent ; it is ready to bur@@ st like new bott@@ les .
I will speak , that I may be ref@@ res@@ hed : I will open my li@@ ps and answer .
let me not , I pra@@ y you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give f@@ lat@@ tering titles un@@ to man .
for I know not to give f@@ lat@@ tering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
be@@ hold , now I have opened my m@@ outh , my ton@@ gue hat@@ h spoken in my m@@ outh .
my words shall be of the u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of my heart : and my li@@ ps shall ut@@ ter knowledge clearly .
if th@@ ou can@@ st answer me , set TH@@ Y words in order before me , stand up .
be@@ hold , I am according to TH@@ Y wish in God 's stead : I also am formed out of the cla@@ y .
be@@ hold , my terror shall not make the@@ e afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon the@@ e .
su@@ rely th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of TH@@ Y words , saying ,
I am clean without trans@@ gres@@ sion , I am innocent ; neither is there in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in me .
why dost th@@ ou strive against him ? for he gi@@ vet@@ h not account of any of his matters .
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sle@@ ep fal@@ le@@ th upon men , in s@@ lum@@ ber@@ ings upon the bed ;
then he open@@ eth the e@@ ars of men , and se@@ al@@ eth their in@@ struction ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
he keep@@ eth back his sou@@ l from the p@@ it , and his life from per@@ ishing by the s@@ word .
he is ch@@ as@@ tened also with p@@ ain upon his bed , and the multi@@ tude of his b@@ ones with strong p@@ ain :
his f@@ les@@ h is consu@@ med away , that it can@@ not be seen ; and his b@@ ones that were not seen stick out .
Ye@@ a , his sou@@ l dra@@ w@@ eth near un@@ to the grave , and his life to the destro@@ yers .
then he is gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to him , and sa@@ ith , D@@ eli@@ ver him from going down to the p@@ it : I have found a ran@@ so@@ m .
his f@@ les@@ h shall be fres@@ her than a child 's : he shall return to the days of his youth :
he shall pra@@ y un@@ to God , and he will be favourable un@@ to him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will ren@@ der un@@ to man his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
he lo@@ ok@@ eth upon men , and if any say , I have sin@@ ned , and per@@ ver@@ ted that which was right , and it pro@@ fi@@ ted me not ;
he will deliver his sou@@ l from going into the p@@ it , and his life shall see the light .
L@@ o , all these things wor@@ ket@@ h God of@@ ten@@ times with man ,
if th@@ ou h@@ ast any thing to say , answer me : speak , for I desire to justify the@@ e .
therefore he@@ arken un@@ to me , ye men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; and from the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , that he should commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for the work of a man shall he ren@@ der un@@ to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
if he set his heart upon man , if he gather un@@ to himself his spirit and his bre@@ ath ;
if now th@@ ou h@@ ast understanding , hear this : he@@ arken to the voice of my words .
is it fit to say to a king , T@@ ho@@ u art w@@ ic@@ ked ? and to pr@@ inces , Y@@ e are un@@ go@@ dly ?
how much less to him that accep@@ te@@ th not the persons of pr@@ inces , nor regar@@ de@@ th the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
in a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the m@@ igh@@ ty shall be taken away without hand .
for he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God .
he shall break in pieces m@@ igh@@ ty men without number , and set others in their stead .
therefore he know@@ eth their works , and he over@@ tur@@ net@@ h them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come un@@ to him , and he he@@ aret@@ h the cry of the aff@@ lic@@ ted .
su@@ rely it is meet to be said un@@ to God , I have bor@@ ne ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement , I will not off@@ end any more :
that which I see not te@@ ach th@@ ou me : if I have done in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , I will do no more .
should it be according to TH@@ Y mind ? he will re@@ compen@@ se it , whether th@@ ou refuse , or whether th@@ ou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what th@@ ou know@@ est .
my desire is that Jo@@ b may be tried un@@ to the end because of his answers for w@@ ic@@ ked men .
for th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , What advantage will it be un@@ to the@@ e ? and , What profit shall I have , if I be cleans@@ ed from my sin ?
look un@@ to the heav@@ ens , and see ; and be@@ hold the cl@@ ou@@ ds which are higher than th@@ ou .
if th@@ ou sin@@ n@@ est , what do@@ est th@@ ou against him ? or if TH@@ Y trans@@ gres@@ sions be multi@@ p@@ lied , what do@@ est th@@ ou un@@ to him ?
TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess may hurt a man as th@@ ou art ; and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness may profit the son of man .
by reason of the multi@@ tude of op@@ pres@@ sions they make the op@@ pressed to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
who teach@@ eth us more than the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and mak@@ eth us wis@@ er than the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ?
although th@@ ou say@@ est th@@ ou s@@ halt not see him , yet judgment is before him ; therefore trust th@@ ou in him .
but now , because it is not so , he hat@@ h visited in his an@@ ger ; yet he know@@ eth it not in great extre@@ mity :
I will f@@ et@@ ch my knowledge from af@@ ar , and will as@@ cri@@ be righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness to my Mak@@ er .
for truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with the@@ e .
he preser@@ vet@@ h not the life of the w@@ ic@@ ked : but gi@@ vet@@ h right to the poor .
he withdra@@ w@@ eth not his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous : but with kings are they on the th@@ r@@ one ; ye@@ a , he do@@ th establish them for ever , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
and if they be bound in f@@ et@@ ters , and be hol@@ den in cor@@ ds of aff@@ li@@ ction ;
then he she@@ w@@ eth them their work , and their trans@@ gres@@ sions that they have exceeded .
he open@@ eth also their e@@ ar to discipline , and comman@@ de@@ th that they return from in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if they obe@@ y not , they shall per@@ ish by the s@@ word , and they shall die without knowledge .
even so would he have removed the@@ e out of the stra@@ it into a broad place , where there is no stra@@ it@@ ness ; and that which should be set on TH@@ Y table should be full of fat@@ ness .
because there is wr@@ ath , be@@ w@@ are lest he take the@@ e away with his stro@@ ke : then a great ran@@ so@@ m can@@ not deliver the@@ e .
will he es@@ te@@ em TH@@ Y ri@@ ches ? no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
be@@ hold , God is great , and we know him not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
for he mak@@ eth small the dro@@ ps of water : they p@@ our down rain according to the v@@ ap@@ our there@@ of :
with cl@@ ou@@ ds he cover@@ eth the light ; and comman@@ de@@ th it not to sh@@ ine by the cl@@ oud that co@@ me@@ th bet@@ wi@@ xt .
at this also my heart tre@@ m@@ ble@@ th , and is moved out of his place .
hear atten@@ tively the no@@ ise of his voice , and the sound that go@@ eth out of his m@@ outh .
he direc@@ te@@ th it under the whole heav@@ en , and his ligh@@ t@@ ning un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
after it a voice ro@@ aret@@ h : he th@@ under@@ eth with the voice of his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
for he sa@@ ith to the snow , Be th@@ ou on the ear@@ th ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
then the be@@ asts go into den@@ s , and remain in their places .
out of the south co@@ me@@ th the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : and cold out of the north .
by the bre@@ ath of God F@@ ro@@ st is given : and the b@@ read@@ th of the waters is stra@@ it@@ ened .
also by wat@@ ering he we@@ ar@@ i@@ eth the th@@ ick cl@@ oud : he sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth his bright cl@@ oud :
and it is turned round about by his coun@@ sels : that they may do wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he comman@@ de@@ th them upon the face of the world in the ear@@ th .
he ca@@ us@@ eth it to come , whether for correc@@ tion , or for his land , or for mer@@ cy .
D@@ ost th@@ ou know when God dis@@ posed them , and caused the light of his cl@@ oud to sh@@ ine ?
D@@ ost th@@ ou know the balan@@ c@@ ings of the cl@@ ou@@ ds , the won@@ dro@@ us works of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
H@@ ast th@@ ou with him spread out the sky , which is strong , and as a m@@ ol@@ ten looking glass ?
shall it be told him that I speak ? if a man speak , su@@ rely he shall be sw@@ allowed up .
and now men see not the bright light which is in the cl@@ ou@@ ds : but the wind pass@@ eth , and cleans@@ eth them .
tou@@ ching the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , we can@@ not find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not aff@@ lic@@ t .
then the Lord answ@@ ered Jo@@ b out of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , and said ,
Gir@@ d up now TH@@ Y lo@@ ins like a man ; for I will demand of the@@ e , and answer th@@ ou me .
where w@@ ast th@@ ou when I laid the foundations of the ear@@ th ? declare , if th@@ ou h@@ ast understanding .
who hat@@ h laid the measures there@@ of , if th@@ ou know@@ est ? or who hat@@ h stret@@ ched the line upon it ?
or who shut up the sea with doors , when it br@@ ake forth , as if it had issued out of the w@@ om@@ b ?
when I made the cl@@ oud the gar@@ ment there@@ of , and th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness a sw@@ add@@ l@@ ing@@ band for it ,
and br@@ ake up for it my decre@@ ed place , and set bars and doors ,
and said , hi@@ ther@@ to s@@ halt th@@ ou come , but no further : and here shall TH@@ Y proud waves be stayed ?
that it might take hold of the ends of the ear@@ th , that the w@@ ic@@ ked might be shaken out of it ?
and from the w@@ ic@@ ked their light is with@@ hol@@ den , and the high arm shall be broken .
H@@ ast th@@ ou entered into the spr@@ ings of the sea ? or h@@ ast th@@ ou walked in the search of the dep@@ th ?
have the gates of death been opened un@@ to the@@ e ? or h@@ ast th@@ ou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take it to the bound there@@ of , and that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest know the p@@ aths to the house there@@ of ?
who hat@@ h divided a water@@ course for the over@@ flow@@ ing of waters , or a way for the ligh@@ t@@ ning of Th@@ under ;
to cause it to rain on the ear@@ th , where no man is ; on the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where@@ in there is no man ;
to satisfy the de@@ so@@ late and waste ground ; and to cause the bu@@ d of the tender her@@ b to spring forth ?
out of whose w@@ om@@ b came the ice ? and the ho@@ ary F@@ ro@@ st of heav@@ en , who hat@@ h gen@@ dered it ?
the waters are hi@@ d as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
who hat@@ h put wis@@ dom in the in@@ ward parts ? or who hat@@ h given understanding to the heart ?
who can number the cl@@ ou@@ ds in wis@@ dom ? or who can stay the bott@@ les of heav@@ en ,
when the d@@ ust grow@@ eth into hard@@ ness , and the clo@@ ds cle@@ ave fast together ?
when they cou@@ ch in their den@@ s , and abide in the cover@@ t to lie in wait ?
who provi@@ de@@ th for the ra@@ ven his food ? when his young ones cry un@@ to God , they w@@ ander for lack of meat .
K@@ now@@ est th@@ ou the time when the wild go@@ ats of the rock bring forth ? or can@@ st th@@ ou mark when the hin@@ ds do cal@@ ve ?
Can@@ st th@@ ou number the months that they fulfil ? or know@@ est th@@ ou the time when they bring forth ?
they bo@@ w themselves , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sor@@ ro@@ ws .
their young ones are in good lik@@ ing , they grow up with cor@@ n ; they go forth , and return not un@@ to them .
who hat@@ h sent out the wild ass free ? or who hat@@ h lo@@ os@@ ed the bands of the wild ass ?
he scor@@ net@@ h the multi@@ tude of the city , neither regar@@ de@@ th he the cr@@ ying of the driver .
the range of the mountains is his pas@@ ture , and he sear@@ ch@@ eth after every green thing .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou trust him , because his strength is great ? or w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou leave TH@@ Y labour to him ?
Wil@@ t th@@ ou believe him , that he will bring home TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and gather it into TH@@ Y bar@@ n ?
and for@@ get@@ te@@ th that the fo@@ ot may cr@@ ush them , or that the wild be@@ ast may break them .
she is har@@ dened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in v@@ ain without fear ;
because God hat@@ h de@@ pri@@ ved her of wis@@ dom , neither hat@@ h he im@@ par@@ ted to her understanding .
what time she lif@@ te@@ th up her@@ self on high , she scor@@ net@@ h the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der .
he p@@ aw@@ eth in the val@@ ley , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth in his strength : he go@@ eth on to meet the armed men .
he sw@@ allow@@ eth the ground with fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess and ra@@ ge : neither believ@@ eth he that it is the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et .
he sa@@ ith among the tr@@ ump@@ ets , H@@ a , ha ; and he s@@ mel@@ le@@ th the battle af@@ ar off , the Th@@ under of the cap@@ tains , and the sh@@ ou@@ ting .
Do@@ th the e@@ ag@@ le mount up at TH@@ Y command , and make her n@@ est on high ?
she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th and abi@@ de@@ th on the rock , upon the c@@ rag of the rock , and the strong place .
once have I spoken ; but I will not answer : ye@@ a , twice ; but I will proceed no further .
then answ@@ ered the Lord un@@ to Jo@@ b out of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , and said ,
cast abroad the ra@@ ge of TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : and be@@ hold every one that is proud , and ab@@ ase him .
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tre@@ ad down the w@@ ic@@ ked in their place .
be@@ hold now beh@@ emo@@ th , which I made with the@@ e ; he e@@ ate@@ th gr@@ ass as an o@@ x .
L@@ o now , his strength is in his lo@@ ins , and his force is in the nav@@ el of his bel@@ ly .
he mov@@ eth his ta@@ il like a c@@ ed@@ ar : the sin@@ ews of his stones are wrapped together .
his b@@ ones are as strong pieces of br@@ ass ; his b@@ ones are like bars of iron .
he is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his s@@ word to approach un@@ to him .
su@@ rely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the be@@ asts of the field play .
he li@@ eth under the sh@@ ady trees , in the cover@@ t of the Re@@ ed , and f@@ ens .
the sh@@ ady trees cover him with their shadow ; the w@@ il@@ lows of the Bro@@ ok comp@@ ass him about .
be@@ hold , he drin@@ ket@@ h up a river , and has@@ te@@ th not : he tr@@ us@@ te@@ th that he can draw up Jordan into his m@@ outh .
Can@@ st th@@ ou put an ho@@ ok into his n@@ ose ? or b@@ ore his j@@ a@@ w through with a Th@@ or@@ n ?
will he make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the@@ e ? w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou take him for a ser@@ vant for ever ?
Can@@ st th@@ ou fill his s@@ kin with bar@@ bed iron ? or his head with fish spe@@ ars ?
be@@ hold , the hope of him is in v@@ ain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
none is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
who hat@@ h prevented me , that I should repay him ? wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is under the whole heav@@ en is mine .
they are joined one to another , they stick together , that they can@@ not be sun@@ dered .
by his ne@@ es@@ ings a light do@@ th sh@@ ine , and his eyes are like the ey@@ eli@@ ds of the morning .
out of his m@@ outh go burning lam@@ ps , and spar@@ ks of fire le@@ ap out .
in his nec@@ k remain@@ eth strength , and sor@@ row is turned into joy before him .
the f@@ lak@@ es of his f@@ les@@ h are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they can@@ not be moved .
his heart is as firm as a stone ; ye@@ a , as hard as a piece of the ne@@ ther mil@@ l@@ stone .
when he ra@@ is@@ eth up himself , the m@@ igh@@ ty are afraid : by reason of break@@ ings they pur@@ ify themselves .
he mak@@ eth the deep to bo@@ il like a po@@ t : he mak@@ eth the sea like a po@@ t of o@@ in@@ tment .
he mak@@ eth a path to sh@@ ine after him ; one would think the deep to be ho@@ ary .
I know that th@@ ou can@@ st do every thing , and that no thought can be with@@ hol@@ den from the@@ e .
I have heard of the@@ e by the hearing of the e@@ ar : but now mine eye se@@ eth the@@ e .
so Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite and Bil@@ dad the Sh@@ u@@ h@@ ite and Z@@ op@@ har the Na@@ am@@ ath@@ ite went , and did according as the Lord comman@@ ded them : the Lord also accepted Jo@@ b .
and the Lord turned the cap@@ tivity of Jo@@ b , when he pray@@ ed for his friends : also the Lord gave Jo@@ b twice as much as he had before .
so the Lord b@@ les@@ sed the latter end of Jo@@ b more than his beginning : for he had fo@@ ur@@ teen thousand she@@ ep , and six thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , and a thousand yok@@ e of ox@@ en , and a thousand she ass@@ es .
after this lived Jo@@ b an hundred and for@@ ty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
so Jo@@ b died , being old and full of days .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that walk@@ eth not in the coun@@ sel of the un@@ go@@ dly , nor stan@@ de@@ th in the way of sin@@ ners , nor sit@@ te@@ th in the seat of the scor@@ n@@ ful .
but his de@@ light is in the law of the Lord ; and in his law do@@ th he medi@@ t@@ ate day and night .
and he shall be like a tree plan@@ ted by the rivers of water , that br@@ ing@@ eth forth his fruit in his season ; his le@@ af also shall not wi@@ ther ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he do@@ eth shall prosp@@ er .
the un@@ go@@ dly are not so : but are like the c@@ haf@@ f which the wind dri@@ vet@@ h away .
therefore the un@@ go@@ dly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sin@@ ners in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
for the Lord know@@ eth the way of the righ@@ te@@ ous : but the way of the un@@ go@@ dly shall per@@ ish .
the kings of the ear@@ th set themselves , and the rul@@ ers take coun@@ sel together , against the Lord , and against his ano@@ in@@ ted , saying ,
he that sit@@ te@@ th in the heav@@ ens shall la@@ ug@@ h : the Lord shall have them in der@@ ision .
then shall he speak un@@ to them in his wr@@ ath , and ve@@ x them in his sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure .
ask of me , and I shall give the@@ e the he@@ a@@ then for th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , and the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th for TH@@ Y possession .
K@@ is@@ s the Son , lest he be angry , and ye per@@ ish from the way , when his wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led but a little . b@@ les@@ sed are all they that put their trust in him .
Lord , how are they increased that trouble me ! many are they that rise up against me .
but th@@ ou , O Lord , art a shield for me ; my gl@@ ory , and the lif@@ ter up of mine head .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his hol@@ y hill . Se@@ lah .
I laid me down and sle@@ pt ; I aw@@ aked ; for the Lord sustained me .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God : for th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ mit@@ ten all mine enem@@ ies upon the che@@ ek bone ; th@@ ou h@@ ast broken the te@@ eth of the un@@ go@@ dly .
hear me when I call , O God of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : th@@ ou h@@ ast en@@ lar@@ ged me when I was in dist@@ ress ; have mer@@ cy upon me , and hear my pray@@ er .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my gl@@ ory into sh@@ ame ? how long will ye love van@@ ity , and seek after leasing ? Se@@ lah .
but know that the Lord hat@@ h set apart him that is go@@ dly for himself : the Lord will hear when I call un@@ to him .
stand in a@@ we , and sin not : commun@@ e with your own heart upon your bed , and be still . Se@@ lah .
offer the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and put your trust in the Lord .
there be many that say , Wh@@ o will she@@ w us any good ? Lord , lift th@@ ou up the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance upon us .
I will both lay me down in peace , and sle@@ ep : for th@@ ou , Lord , only mak@@ est me d@@ well in safety .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of my cry , my King , and my God : for un@@ to the@@ e will I pra@@ y .
my voice s@@ halt th@@ ou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my pray@@ er un@@ to the@@ e , and will look up .
for th@@ ou art not a God that hat@@ h pleas@@ ure in w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : neither shall ev@@ il d@@ well with the@@ e .
the fo@@ ol@@ ish shall not stand in TH@@ Y sight : th@@ ou ha@@ test all workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but as for me , I will come into TH@@ Y house in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : and in TH@@ Y fear will I worship toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
lead me , O Lord , in TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness because of mine enem@@ ies ; make TH@@ Y way stra@@ ight before my face .
for there is no fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness in their m@@ outh ; their in@@ ward part is very w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; their thro@@ at is an open se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; they f@@ latter with their ton@@ gue .
destroy th@@ ou them , O God ; let them fall by their own coun@@ sels ; cast them out in the multi@@ tude of their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; for they have rebel@@ led against the@@ e .
but let all those that put their trust in the@@ e re@@ jo@@ ice : let them ever sh@@ out for joy , because th@@ ou defen@@ dest them : let them also that love TH@@ Y name be jo@@ y@@ ful in the@@ e .
for th@@ ou , Lord , w@@ il@@ t b@@ less the righ@@ te@@ ous ; with favour w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou comp@@ ass him as with a shield .
have mer@@ cy upon me , O Lord ; for I am weak : O Lord , he@@ al me ; for my b@@ ones are v@@ ex@@ ed .
I am we@@ ary with my gro@@ an@@ ing ; all the night make I my bed to sw@@ im ; I water my cou@@ ch with my te@@ ars .
mine eye is consu@@ med because of gri@@ ef ; it wa@@ x@@ eth old because of all mine enem@@ ies .
de@@ part from me , all ye workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for the Lord hat@@ h heard the voice of my we@@ eping .
the Lord hat@@ h heard my supp@@ lic@@ ation ; the Lord will receive my pray@@ er .
O Lord my God , in the@@ e do I put my trust : save me from all them that persec@@ ute me , and deliver me :
O Lord my God , if I have done this ; if there be in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in my hands ;
if I have re@@ warded ev@@ il un@@ to him that was at peace with me ; ( ye@@ a , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
let the enemy persec@@ ute my sou@@ l , and take it ; ye@@ a , let him tre@@ ad down my life upon the ear@@ th , and lay mine honour in the d@@ ust . Se@@ lah .
arise , O Lord , in th@@ ine an@@ ger , lift up th@@ y@@ self because of the ra@@ ge of mine enem@@ ies : and aw@@ ake for me to the judgment that th@@ ou h@@ ast comman@@ ded .
so shall the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the people comp@@ ass the@@ e about : for their sak@@ es therefore return th@@ ou on high .
the Lord shall judge the people : judge me , O Lord , according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
O@@ h let the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the w@@ ic@@ ked come to an end ; but establish the just : for the righ@@ te@@ ous God tri@@ eth the hear@@ ts and re@@ ins .
if he turn not , he will wh@@ et his s@@ word ; he hat@@ h b@@ ent his bo@@ w , and made it ready .
he hat@@ h also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he or@@ da@@ in@@ eth his ar@@ ro@@ ws against the persec@@ ut@@ ors .
he made a p@@ it , and dig@@ ged it , and is fallen into the di@@ t@@ ch which he made .
his mis@@ chief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own p@@ ate .
out of the m@@ outh of Bab@@ es and su@@ ck@@ lings h@@ ast th@@ ou or@@ da@@ ined strength because of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test still the enemy and the av@@ eng@@ er .
when I consider TH@@ Y heav@@ ens , the work of TH@@ Y fin@@ gers , the moon and the stars , which th@@ ou h@@ ast or@@ da@@ ined ;
T@@ ho@@ u ma@@ dest him to have domin@@ ion over the works of TH@@ Y hands ; th@@ ou h@@ ast put all things under his feet :
all she@@ ep and ox@@ en , ye@@ a , and the be@@ asts of the field ;
the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and the fish of the sea , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever pass@@ eth through the p@@ aths of the seas .
I will praise the@@ e , O Lord , with my whole heart ; I will she@@ w forth all TH@@ Y mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous works .
I will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in the@@ e : I will sing praise to TH@@ Y name , O th@@ ou most High .
when mine enem@@ ies are turned back , they shall fall and per@@ ish at TH@@ Y presence .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast re@@ bu@@ ked the he@@ a@@ then , th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed the w@@ ic@@ ked , th@@ ou h@@ ast put out their name for ever and ever .
O th@@ ou enemy , de@@ struc@@ tions are come to a perpet@@ ual end : and th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed cities ; their memorial is per@@ ished with them .
and he shall judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , he shall minister judgment to the people in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
the Lord also will be a ref@@ uge for the op@@ pressed , a ref@@ uge in times of trouble .
and they that know TH@@ Y name will put their trust in the@@ e : for th@@ ou , Lord , h@@ ast not for@@ sak@@ en them that seek the@@ e .
sing pra@@ ises to the Lord , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Z@@ ion : declare among the people his do@@ ings .
when he mak@@ eth In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition for blood , he remember@@ eth them : he for@@ get@@ te@@ th not the cry of the hum@@ ble .
that I may she@@ w forth all TH@@ Y praise in the gates of the daughter of Z@@ ion : I will re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
the he@@ a@@ then are sun@@ k down in the p@@ it that they made : in the net which they hi@@ d is their own fo@@ ot taken .
the Lord is known by the judgment which he execu@@ te@@ th : the w@@ ic@@ ked is s@@ nar@@ ed in the work of his own hands . Hig@@ ga@@ ion . Se@@ lah .
the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
for the ne@@ edy shall not al@@ way be forgotten : the expec@@ tation of the poor shall not per@@ ish for ever .
arise , O Lord ; let not man prev@@ ail : let the he@@ a@@ then be jud@@ ged in TH@@ Y sight .
put them in fear , O Lord : that the nations may know themselves to be but men . Se@@ lah .
the w@@ ic@@ ked in his pride do@@ th persec@@ ute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imag@@ ined .
his ways are always gri@@ ev@@ ous ; TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enem@@ ies , he pu@@ ff@@ eth at them .
he sit@@ te@@ th in the l@@ ur@@ king places of the villages : in the secret places do@@ th he murder the innocent : his eyes are priv@@ ily set against the poor .
he li@@ eth in wait secre@@ tly as a lion in his den : he li@@ eth in wait to catch the poor : he do@@ th catch the poor , when he dra@@ w@@ eth him into his net .
he cro@@ u@@ ch@@ eth , and hum@@ ble@@ th himself , that the poor may fall by his strong ones .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast seen it ; for th@@ ou be@@ hol@@ dest mis@@ chief and spite , to requ@@ ite it with TH@@ Y hand : the poor commit@@ te@@ th himself un@@ to the@@ e ; th@@ ou art the hel@@ per of the fa@@ ther@@ less .
break th@@ ou the arm of the w@@ ic@@ ked and the ev@@ il man : seek out his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ti@@ ll th@@ ou find none .
the Lord is King for ever and ever : the he@@ a@@ then are per@@ ished out of his land .
Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast heard the desire of the hum@@ ble : th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t prepare their heart , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cause th@@ ine e@@ ar to hear :
in the Lord put I my trust : how say ye to my sou@@ l , flee as a bird to your mountain ?
for , lo , the w@@ ic@@ ked b@@ end their bo@@ w , they make ready their ar@@ row upon the str@@ ing , that they may priv@@ ily sho@@ ot at the u@@ pri@@ ght in heart .
the Lord is in his hol@@ y temp@@ le , the Lord 's th@@ r@@ one is in heav@@ en : his eyes be@@ hold , his ey@@ eli@@ ds try , the children of men .
the Lord tri@@ eth the righ@@ te@@ ous : but the w@@ ic@@ ked and him that lov@@ eth violence his sou@@ l ha@@ te@@ th .
upon the w@@ ic@@ ked he shall rain s@@ nar@@ es , fire and bri@@ m@@ stone , and an hor@@ ri@@ ble temp@@ est : this shall be the portion of their c@@ up .
they speak van@@ ity every one with his neighbour : with f@@ lat@@ tering li@@ ps and with a double heart do they speak .
the Lord shall cut off all f@@ lat@@ tering li@@ ps , and the ton@@ gue that speak@@ eth proud things :
the words of the Lord are p@@ ure words : as silver tried in a fur@@ n@@ ace of ear@@ th , pur@@ ified seven times .
how long shall I take coun@@ sel in my sou@@ l , having sor@@ row in my heart daily ? how long shall mine enemy be ex@@ al@@ ted over me ?
L@@ est mine enemy say , I have prev@@ ailed against him ; and those that trouble me re@@ jo@@ ice when I am moved .
but I have tr@@ usted in TH@@ Y mer@@ cy ; my heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
the Lord looked down from heav@@ en upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , and seek God .
they are all gone aside , they are all together become fil@@ thy : there is none that do@@ eth good , no , not one .
have all the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the Lord .
there were they in great fear : for God is in the generation of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
O@@ h that the sal@@ vation of Israel were come out of Z@@ ion ! when the Lord br@@ ing@@ eth back the cap@@ tivity of his people , Jac@@ o@@ b shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and Israel shall be glad .
he that walk@@ eth u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly , and wor@@ ket@@ h righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and speak@@ eth the truth in his heart .
he that back@@ bi@@ te@@ th not with his ton@@ gue , nor do@@ eth ev@@ il to his neighbour , nor tak@@ eth up a re@@ pro@@ ach against his neighbour .
in whose eyes a v@@ ile person is con@@ tem@@ ned ; but he hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th them that fear the Lord . he that swe@@ aret@@ h to his own hurt , and chan@@ get@@ h not .
he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th not out his money to us@@ ury , nor tak@@ eth reward against the innocent . he that do@@ eth these things shall never be moved .
but to the sa@@ ints that are in the ear@@ th , and to the excellent , in whom is all my de@@ light .
their sor@@ ro@@ ws shall be multi@@ p@@ lied that has@@ ten after another go@@ d : their drink offer@@ ings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my li@@ ps .
the lines are fallen un@@ to me in pleas@@ ant places ; ye@@ a , I have a good@@ ly heritage .
I will b@@ less the Lord , who hat@@ h given me coun@@ sel : my re@@ ins also instruc@@ t me in the night se@@ as@@ ons .
I have set the Lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t she@@ w me the path of life : in TH@@ Y presence is ful@@ ness of joy ; at TH@@ Y right hand there are pleas@@ ures for ever@@ more .
hear the right , O Lord , attend un@@ to my cry , give e@@ ar un@@ to my pray@@ er , that go@@ eth not out of fe@@ ig@@ ned li@@ ps .
let my sentence come forth from TH@@ Y presence ; let th@@ ine eyes be@@ hold the things that are equal .
concerning the works of men , by the word of TH@@ Y li@@ ps I have kept me from the p@@ aths of the destro@@ yer .
I have called upon the@@ e , for th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t hear me , O God : inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar un@@ to me , and hear my speech .
She@@ w TH@@ Y mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O th@@ ou that sav@@ est by TH@@ Y right hand them which put their trust in the@@ e from those that rise up against them .
keep me as the app@@ le of the eye , hide me under the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings ,
from the w@@ ic@@ ked that op@@ press me , from my deadly enem@@ ies , who comp@@ ass me about .
they are inc@@ los@@ ed in their own f@@ at : with their m@@ outh they speak pro@@ u@@ dly .
they have now comp@@ ass@@ ed us in our steps : they have set their eyes bo@@ wing down to the ear@@ th ;
like as a lion that is gre@@ edy of his pre@@ y , and as it were a young lion l@@ ur@@ king in secret places .
arise , O Lord , dis@@ appoint him , cast him down : deliver my sou@@ l from the w@@ ic@@ ked , which is TH@@ Y s@@ word :
as for me , I will be@@ hold TH@@ Y face in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : I shall be satisfied , when I aw@@ ake , with TH@@ Y lik@@ eness .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my bu@@ ck@@ ler , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , and my high to@@ wer .
I will call upon the Lord , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from mine enem@@ ies .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of death comp@@ ass@@ ed me , and the floods of un@@ go@@ dly men made me afraid .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed un@@ to my God : he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry came before him , even into his e@@ ars .
then the ear@@ th sho@@ ok and tre@@ m@@ b@@ led ; the foundations also of the hil@@ ls moved and were shaken , because he was wro@@ th .
there went up a smoke out of his nos@@ tr@@ ils , and fire out of his m@@ outh dev@@ oured : co@@ als were kin@@ d@@ led by it .
he bo@@ wed the heav@@ ens also , and came down : and d@@ ark@@ ness was under his feet .
and he ro@@ de upon a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and did fly : ye@@ a , he did fly upon the w@@ ings of the wind .
he made d@@ ark@@ ness his secret place ; his pav@@ il@@ ion round about him were dark waters and th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sk@@ ies .
at the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that was before him his th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds passed , ha@@ il stones and co@@ als of fire .
the Lord also th@@ under@@ ed in the heav@@ ens , and the High@@ est gave his voice ; ha@@ il stones and co@@ als of fire .
Ye@@ a , he sent out his ar@@ ro@@ ws , and sc@@ at@@ tered them ; and he shot out ligh@@ t@@ nings , and dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at TH@@ Y re@@ bu@@ ke , O Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of TH@@ Y nos@@ tr@@ ils .
he sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them which ha@@ ted me : for they were too strong for me .
they prevented me in the day of my cal@@ am@@ ity : but the Lord was my stay .
he brought me forth also into a large place ; he delivered me , because he deli@@ gh@@ ted in me .
the Lord re@@ warded me according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; according to the cle@@ ann@@ ess of my hands hat@@ h he re@@ compen@@ sed me .
for I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly depar@@ ted from my God .
for all his judg@@ ments were before me , and I did not put away his stat@@ utes from me .
I was also u@@ pri@@ ght before him , and I kept myself from mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
therefore hat@@ h the Lord re@@ compen@@ sed me according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , according to the cle@@ ann@@ ess of my hands in his ey@@ es@@ ight .
with the mer@@ ci@@ ful th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self mer@@ ci@@ ful ; with an u@@ pri@@ ght man th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self u@@ pri@@ ght ;
with the p@@ ure th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self p@@ ure ; and with the fro@@ ward th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t she@@ w th@@ y@@ self fro@@ ward .
for th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save the aff@@ lic@@ ted people ; but w@@ il@@ t bring down high looks .
for by the@@ e I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I le@@ ap@@ ed over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect : the word of the Lord is tried : he is a bu@@ ck@@ ler to all those that trust in him .
he mak@@ eth my feet like hin@@ ds ' feet , and set@@ te@@ th me upon my high places .
he teach@@ eth my hands to war , so that a bo@@ w of steel is broken by mine arms .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast en@@ lar@@ ged my steps under me , that my feet did not sli@@ p .
I have pursu@@ ed mine enem@@ ies , and over@@ taken them : neither did I turn again ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med .
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen under my feet .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast gir@@ ded me with strength un@@ to the battle : th@@ ou h@@ ast sub@@ du@@ ed under me those that rose up against me .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also given me the nec@@ ks of mine enem@@ ies ; that I might destroy them that h@@ ate me .
they cri@@ ed , but there was none to save them : even un@@ to the Lord , but he answ@@ ered them not .
then did I beat them small as the d@@ ust before the wind : I did cast them out as the dir@@ t in the streets .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of the people ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast made me the head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me , they shall obe@@ y me : the st@@ ran@@ gers shall submit themselves un@@ to me .
the st@@ ran@@ gers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
the Lord li@@ vet@@ h ; and b@@ les@@ sed be my rock ; and let the God of my sal@@ vation be ex@@ al@@ ted .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enem@@ ies : ye@@ a , th@@ ou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
therefore will I give thanks un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , among the he@@ a@@ then , and sing pra@@ ises un@@ to TH@@ Y name .
great deliver@@ ance gi@@ vet@@ h he to his king ; and she@@ w@@ eth mer@@ cy to his ano@@ in@@ ted , to David , and to his se@@ ed for ever@@ more .
their line is gone out through all the ear@@ th , and their words to the end of the world . in them hat@@ h he set a tab@@ ern@@ acle for the sun ,
which is as a bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om coming out of his chamber , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth as a strong man to run a race .
his going forth is from the end of the heav@@ en , and his cir@@ cu@@ it un@@ to the ends of it : and there is nothing hi@@ d from the heat there@@ of .
the law of the Lord is perfect , conver@@ ting the sou@@ l : the testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
the stat@@ utes of the Lord are right , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing the heart : the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord is p@@ ure , en@@ ligh@@ tening the eyes .
the fear of the Lord is clean , en@@ during for ever : the judg@@ ments of the Lord are true and righ@@ te@@ ous altogether .
moreover by them is TH@@ Y ser@@ vant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
keep back TH@@ Y ser@@ vant also from pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous sin@@ s ; let them not have domin@@ ion over me : then shall I be u@@ pri@@ ght , and I shall be innocent from the great trans@@ gres@@ sion .
the Lord hear the@@ e in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b defend the@@ e ;
grant the@@ e according to th@@ ine own heart , and fulfil all TH@@ Y coun@@ sel .
we will re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y sal@@ vation , and in the name of our God we will set up our ban@@ ners : the Lord fulfil all TH@@ Y peti@@ tions .
now know I that the Lord sav@@ eth his ano@@ in@@ ted ; he will hear him from his hol@@ y heav@@ en with the saving strength of his right hand .
some trust in char@@ i@@ ots , and some in hor@@ ses : but we will remember the name of the Lord our God .
the king shall joy in TH@@ Y strength , O Lord ; and in TH@@ Y sal@@ vation how greatly shall he re@@ jo@@ ice !
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast given him his heart 's desire , and h@@ ast not with@@ hol@@ den the request of his li@@ ps . Se@@ lah .
for th@@ ou preven@@ test him with the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of Go@@ od@@ ness : th@@ ou set@@ test a cro@@ wn of p@@ ure gold on his head .
he asked life of the@@ e , and th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast made him most b@@ les@@ sed for ever : th@@ ou h@@ ast made him exceeding glad with TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance .
for the king tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the Lord , and through the mer@@ cy of the most High he shall not be moved .
Th@@ ine hand shall find out all th@@ ine enem@@ ies : TH@@ Y right hand shall find out those that h@@ ate the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt make them as a fi@@ ery ov@@ en in the time of th@@ ine an@@ ger : the Lord shall sw@@ allow them up in his wr@@ ath , and the fire shall dev@@ our them .
their fruit s@@ halt th@@ ou destroy from the ear@@ th , and their se@@ ed from among the children of men .
for they intended ev@@ il against the@@ e : they imag@@ ined a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous device , which they are not able to perform .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou make them turn their back , when th@@ ou s@@ halt make ready th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws upon TH@@ Y str@@ ings against the face of them .
be th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted , Lord , in th@@ ine own strength : so will we sing and praise TH@@ Y power .
my God , my God , why h@@ ast th@@ ou for@@ sak@@ en me ? why art th@@ ou so far from helping me , and from the words of my ro@@ aring ?
O my God , I cry in the day@@ time , but th@@ ou hear@@ est not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
they cri@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e , and were delivered : they tr@@ usted in the@@ e , and were not con@@ founded .
all they that see me la@@ ug@@ h me to scor@@ n : they sho@@ ot out the li@@ p , they shake the head saying ,
but th@@ ou art he that took me out of the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st make me hope when I was upon my mother 's bre@@ asts .
I was cast upon the@@ e from the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou art my God from my mother 's bel@@ ly .
they g@@ ap@@ ed upon me with their m@@ ou@@ ths , as a ra@@ ven@@ ing and a ro@@ aring lion .
I am p@@ oured out like water , and all my b@@ ones are out of joint : my heart is like wa@@ x ; it is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of my bo@@ wel@@ s .
my strength is dri@@ ed up like a po@@ t@@ sh@@ er@@ d ; and my ton@@ gue cle@@ av@@ eth to my j@@ a@@ ws ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast brought me into the d@@ ust of death .
for do@@ gs have comp@@ ass@@ ed me : the assembly of the w@@ ic@@ ked have inc@@ los@@ ed me : they pi@@ er@@ ced my hands and my feet .
save me from the lion 's m@@ outh : for th@@ ou h@@ ast heard me from the hor@@ ns of the un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns .
I will declare TH@@ Y name un@@ to my bre@@ th@@ ren : in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation will I praise the@@ e .
for he hat@@ h not desp@@ ised nor ab@@ hor@@ red the aff@@ li@@ ction of the aff@@ lic@@ ted ; neither hat@@ h he hi@@ d his face from him ; but when he cri@@ ed un@@ to him , he heard .
my praise shall be of the@@ e in the great Con@@ gre@@ gation : I will pay my vows before them that fear him .
the me@@ ek shall eat and be satisfied : they shall praise the Lord that seek him : your heart shall live for ever .
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn un@@ to the Lord : and all the kin@@ dre@@ ds of the nations shall worship before the@@ e .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom is the Lord 's : and he is the governor among the nations .
all they that be f@@ at upon ear@@ th shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the d@@ ust shall bo@@ w before him : and none can keep alive his own sou@@ l .
a se@@ ed shall serve him ; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation .
he mak@@ eth me to lie down in green pas@@ tures : he le@@ ade@@ th me bes@@ ide the still waters .
he re@@ sto@@ re@@ th my sou@@ l : he le@@ ade@@ th me in the p@@ aths of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness for his name 's sake .
Ye@@ a , though I walk through the val@@ ley of the shadow of death , I will fear no ev@@ il : for th@@ ou art with me ; TH@@ Y ro@@ d and TH@@ Y staff they comfor@@ t me .
T@@ ho@@ u prepar@@ est a table before me in the presence of mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou ano@@ in@@ test my head with oil ; my c@@ up run@@ net@@ h over .
su@@ rely Go@@ od@@ ness and mer@@ cy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will d@@ well in the house of the Lord for ever .
the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of ; the world , and they that d@@ well there@@ in .
who shall as@@ cen@@ d into the hill of the Lord ? or who shall stand in his hol@@ y place ?
he that hat@@ h clean hands , and a p@@ ure heart ; who hat@@ h not lifted up his sou@@ l un@@ to van@@ ity , nor sworn dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully .
he shall receive the b@@ les@@ sing from the Lord , and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness from the God of his sal@@ vation .
this is the generation of them that seek him , that seek TH@@ Y face , O Jac@@ o@@ b . Se@@ lah .
lift up your head , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye ever@@ lasting doors ; and the King of gl@@ ory shall come in .
lift up your heads , O ye gates ; even lift them up , ye ever@@ lasting doors ; and the King of gl@@ ory shall come in .
O my God , I trust in the@@ e : let me not be as@@ ha@@ med , let not mine enem@@ ies triumph over me .
Ye@@ a , let none that wait on the@@ e be as@@ ha@@ med : let them be as@@ ha@@ med which trans@@ gress without cause .
lead me in TH@@ Y truth , and te@@ ach me : for th@@ ou art the God of my sal@@ vation ; on the@@ e do I wait all the day .
remember not the sin@@ s of my youth , nor my trans@@ gres@@ sions : according to TH@@ Y mer@@ cy remember th@@ ou me for TH@@ Y Go@@ od@@ ness ' sake , O Lord .
all the p@@ aths of the Lord are mer@@ cy and truth un@@ to such as keep his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and his testimon@@ ies .
for TH@@ Y name 's sake , O Lord , par@@ don mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for it is great .
what man is he that fear@@ eth the Lord ? him shall he te@@ ach in the way that he shall choose .
the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him ; and he will she@@ w them his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
mine eyes are ever toward the Lord ; for he shall p@@ lu@@ ck my feet out of the net .
turn the@@ e un@@ to me , and have mer@@ cy upon me ; for I am de@@ so@@ late and aff@@ lic@@ ted .
the troub@@ les of my heart are en@@ lar@@ ged : O bring th@@ ou me out of my dist@@ resses .
O keep my sou@@ l , and deliver me : let me not be as@@ ha@@ med ; for I put my trust in the@@ e .
judge me , O Lord ; for I have walked in mine integrity : I have tr@@ usted also in the Lord ; therefore I shall not sli@@ de .
I have not sat with v@@ ain persons , neither will I go in with dis@@ sem@@ b@@ lers .
I have ha@@ ted the Con@@ gre@@ gation of ev@@ il do@@ ers ; and will not sit with the w@@ ic@@ ked .
that I may publish with the voice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and tell of all TH@@ Y won@@ dro@@ us works .
Lord , I have lov@@ ed the habi@@ tation of TH@@ Y house , and the place where th@@ ine honour d@@ wel@@ le@@ th .
but as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : re@@ de@@ em me , and be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me .
the Lord is my light and my sal@@ vation ; whom shall I fear ? the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
when the w@@ ic@@ ked , even mine enem@@ ies and my fo@@ es , came upon me to eat up my f@@ les@@ h , they stumb@@ led and fell .
though an host should en@@ camp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pav@@ il@@ ion : in the secret of his tab@@ ern@@ acle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
hear , O Lord , when I cry with my voice : have mer@@ cy also upon me , and answer me .
te@@ ach me TH@@ Y way , O Lord , and lead me in a pla@@ in path , because of mine enem@@ ies .
deliver me not over un@@ to the will of mine enem@@ ies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as bre@@ a@@ the out cru@@ el@@ ty .
I had fa@@ in@@ ted , unless I had believed to see the Go@@ od@@ ness of the Lord in the land of the living .
wait on the Lord : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen th@@ ine heart : wait , I say , on the Lord .
un@@ to the@@ e will I cry , O Lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if th@@ ou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the p@@ it .
hear the voice of my supp@@ lic@@ ations , when I cry un@@ to the@@ e , when I lift up my hands toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y or@@ acle .
draw me not away with the w@@ ic@@ ked , and with the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mis@@ chief is in their hear@@ ts .
because they regard not the works of the Lord , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
the Lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart tr@@ usted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth ; and with my song will I praise him .
the Lord is their strength , and he is the saving strength of his ano@@ in@@ ted .
give un@@ to the Lord the gl@@ ory due un@@ to his name ; worship the Lord in the beauty of hol@@ iness .
the voice of the Lord is upon the waters : the God of gl@@ ory th@@ under@@ eth : the Lord is upon many waters .
the voice of the Lord is powerful ; the voice of the Lord is full of maj@@ es@@ ty .
the voice of the Lord break@@ eth the c@@ ed@@ ars ; ye@@ a , the Lord break@@ eth the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon .
he mak@@ eth them also to sk@@ ip like a cal@@ f ; Lebanon and S@@ iri@@ on like a young un@@ ic@@ or@@ n .
the Lord will give strength un@@ to his people ; the Lord will b@@ less his people with peace .
I will ex@@ to@@ l the@@ e , O Lord ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast lifted me up , and h@@ ast not made my fo@@ es to re@@ jo@@ ice over me .
O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast brought up my sou@@ l from the grave : th@@ ou h@@ ast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the p@@ it .
sing un@@ to the Lord , O ye sa@@ ints of his , and give thanks at the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of his hol@@ iness .
for his an@@ ger en@@ du@@ re@@ th but a moment ; in his favour is life : we@@ eping may en@@ dur@@ e for a night , but joy co@@ me@@ th in the morning .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast turned for me my mourning into dan@@ cing : th@@ ou h@@ ast put off my s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and gir@@ ded me with gla@@ d@@ ness ;
to the end that my gl@@ ory may sing praise to the@@ e , and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks un@@ to the@@ e for ever .
in the@@ e , O Lord , do I put my trust ; let me never be as@@ ha@@ med : deliver me in TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
pull me out of the net that they have laid priv@@ ily for me : for th@@ ou art my strength .
into th@@ ine hand I commit my spirit : th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed me , O Lord God of truth .
I will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : for th@@ ou h@@ ast considered my trouble ; th@@ ou h@@ ast known my sou@@ l in ad@@ versities ;
and h@@ ast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : th@@ ou h@@ ast set my feet in a large room .
have mer@@ cy upon me , O Lord , for I am in trouble : mine eye is consu@@ med with gri@@ ef , ye@@ a , my sou@@ l and my bel@@ ly .
for my life is spent with gri@@ ef , and my years with si@@ gh@@ ing : my strength fail@@ eth because of mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and my b@@ ones are consu@@ med .
I was a re@@ pro@@ ach among all mine enem@@ ies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance : they that did see me without fled from me .
for I have heard the s@@ lan@@ der of many : fear was on every side : while they took coun@@ sel together against me , they dev@@ ised to take away my life .
my times are in TH@@ Y hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enem@@ ies , and from them that persec@@ ute me .
make TH@@ Y face to sh@@ ine upon TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : save me for TH@@ Y mer@@ cies ' sake .
let me not be as@@ ha@@ med , O Lord ; for I have called upon the@@ e : let the w@@ ic@@ ked be as@@ ha@@ med , and let them be silent in the grave .
O@@ h how great is TH@@ Y Go@@ od@@ ness , which th@@ ou h@@ ast laid up for them that fear the@@ e ; which th@@ ou h@@ ast w@@ rought for them that trust in the@@ e before the sons of men !
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt hide them in the secret of TH@@ Y presence from the pride of man : th@@ ou s@@ halt keep them secre@@ tly in a pav@@ il@@ ion from the stri@@ fe of ton@@ gues .
for I said in my has@@ te , I am cut off from before th@@ ine eyes : nevertheless th@@ ou hear@@ dest the voice of my supp@@ lic@@ ations when I cri@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e .
be of good courage , and he shall strengthen your heart , all ye that hope in the Lord .
b@@ les@@ sed is he whose trans@@ gres@@ sion is for@@ given , whose sin is covered .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man un@@ to whom the Lord imp@@ u@@ te@@ th not in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and in whose spirit there is no gu@@ ile .
when I kept sil@@ ence , my b@@ ones wa@@ xed old through my ro@@ aring all the day long .
for day and night TH@@ Y hand was heavy upon me : my mo@@ ist@@ ure is turned into the drought of summer . Se@@ lah .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in a time when th@@ ou may@@ est be found : su@@ rely in the floods of great waters they shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to him .
T@@ ho@@ u art my hiding place ; th@@ ou s@@ halt preserve me from trouble ; th@@ ou s@@ halt comp@@ ass me about with songs of deliver@@ ance . Se@@ lah .
I will instruc@@ t the@@ e and te@@ ach the@@ e in the way which th@@ ou s@@ halt go : I will guide the@@ e with mine eye .
be ye not as the hor@@ se , or as the mul@@ e , which have no understanding : whose m@@ outh must be held in with bit and bri@@ dle , lest they come near un@@ to the@@ e .
many sor@@ ro@@ ws shall be to the w@@ ic@@ ked : but he that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the Lord , mer@@ cy shall comp@@ ass him about .
praise the Lord with har@@ p : sing un@@ to him with the p@@ sal@@ tery and an instrument of ten str@@ ings .
for the word of the Lord is right ; and all his works are done in truth .
he lov@@ eth righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and judgment : the ear@@ th is full of the Go@@ od@@ ness of the Lord .
by the word of the Lord were the heav@@ ens made ; and all the host of them by the bre@@ ath of his m@@ outh .
he gather@@ eth the waters of the sea together as an he@@ ap : he lay@@ eth up the dep@@ th in sto@@ re@@ houses .
let all the ear@@ th fear the Lord : let all the inhabitants of the world stand in a@@ we of him .
the Lord br@@ ing@@ eth the coun@@ sel of the he@@ a@@ then to n@@ ought : he mak@@ eth the devices of the people of none effect .
b@@ les@@ sed is the nation whose God is the Lord : and the people whom he hat@@ h chosen for his own inher@@ it@@ ance .
the Lord lo@@ ok@@ eth from heav@@ en ; he be@@ hol@@ de@@ th all the sons of men .
from the place of his habi@@ tation he lo@@ ok@@ eth upon all the inhabitants of the ear@@ th .
there is no king sav@@ ed by the multi@@ tude of an host : a m@@ igh@@ ty man is not delivered by much strength .
be@@ hold , the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mer@@ cy ;
our sou@@ l w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the Lord : he is our help and our shield .
for our heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in him , because we have tr@@ usted in his hol@@ y name .
I will b@@ less the Lord at all times : his praise shall continu@@ ally be in my m@@ outh .
this poor man cri@@ ed , and the Lord heard him , and sav@@ ed him out of all his troub@@ les .
O fear the Lord , ye his sa@@ ints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
the young li@@ ons do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing .
what man is he that desi@@ re@@ th life , and lov@@ eth many days , that he may see good ?
the eyes of the Lord are upon the righ@@ te@@ ous , and his e@@ ars are open un@@ to their cry .
the face of the Lord is against them that do ev@@ il , to cut off the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of them from the ear@@ th .
the righ@@ te@@ ous cry , and the Lord he@@ aret@@ h , and deliver@@ eth them out of all their troub@@ les .
the Lord is n@@ igh un@@ to them that are of a broken heart ; and sav@@ eth such as be of a contr@@ ite spirit .
many are the aff@@ lic@@ tions of the righ@@ te@@ ous : but the Lord deliver@@ eth him out of them all .
the Lord re@@ de@@ eme@@ th the sou@@ l of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be de@@ so@@ late .
p@@ lead my cause , O Lord , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against me .
draw out also the spe@@ ar , and stop the way against them that persec@@ ute me : say un@@ to my sou@@ l , I am TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
let them be con@@ founded and put to sh@@ ame that seek after my sou@@ l : let them be turned back and brought to conf@@ usion that dev@@ ise my hurt .
let them be as c@@ haf@@ f before the wind : and let the an@@ gel of the Lord ch@@ ase them .
let their way be dark and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y : and let the an@@ gel of the Lord persec@@ ute them .
for without cause have they hi@@ d for me their net in a p@@ it , which without cause they have dig@@ ged for my sou@@ l .
let destruction come upon him at un@@ awar@@ es ; and let his net that he hat@@ h hi@@ d catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
and my sou@@ l shall be jo@@ y@@ ful in the Lord : it shall re@@ jo@@ ice in his sal@@ vation .
all my b@@ ones shall say , Lord , who is like un@@ to the@@ e , which deliver@@ est the poor from him that is too strong for him , ye@@ a , the poor and the ne@@ edy from him that sp@@ o@@ il@@ eth him ?
false witnesses did rise up ; they laid to my charge things that I knew not .
I will give the@@ e thanks in the great Con@@ gre@@ gation : I will praise the@@ e among much people .
let not them that are mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully re@@ jo@@ ice over me : neither let them win@@ k with the eye that h@@ ate me without a cause .
for they speak not peace : but they dev@@ ise dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful matters against them that are quiet in the land .
stir up th@@ y@@ self , and aw@@ ake to my judgment , even un@@ to my cause , my God and my Lord .
judge me , O Lord my God , according to TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; and let them not re@@ jo@@ ice over me .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and brought to conf@@ usion together that re@@ jo@@ ice at mine hurt : let them be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame and dis@@ honour that mag@@ ni@@ fy themselves against me .
and my ton@@ gue shall speak of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and of TH@@ Y praise all the day long .
the trans@@ gres@@ sion of the w@@ ic@@ ked sa@@ ith within my heart , that there is no fear of God before his eyes .
for he f@@ lat@@ ter@@ eth himself in his own eyes , until his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity be found to be ha@@ te@@ ful .
the words of his m@@ outh are in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and dec@@ e@@ it : he hat@@ h left off to be wise , and to do good .
he dev@@ is@@ eth mis@@ chief upon his bed ; he set@@ te@@ th himself in a way that is not good ; he ab@@ hor@@ re@@ th not ev@@ il .
TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , O Lord , is in the heav@@ ens ; and TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
how excellent is TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings .
they shall be ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly satisfied with the fat@@ ness of TH@@ Y house ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt make them drink of the river of TH@@ Y pleas@@ ures .
for with the@@ e is the fo@@ un@@ tain of life : in TH@@ Y light shall we see light .
O continue TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to them that know the@@ e ; and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness to the u@@ pri@@ ght in heart .
let not the fo@@ ot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked remove me .
there are the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , neither be th@@ ou en@@ vi@@ ous against the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
trust in the Lord , and do good ; so s@@ halt th@@ ou d@@ well in the land , and veril@@ y th@@ ou s@@ halt be f@@ ed .
de@@ light th@@ y@@ self also in the Lord ; and he shall give the@@ e the desi@@ res of th@@ ine heart .
commit TH@@ Y way un@@ to the Lord ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass .
rest in the Lord , and wait pati@@ ently for him : fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of him who prosp@@ er@@ eth in his way , because of the man who br@@ ing@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked devices to pass .
for ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers shall be cut off : but those that wait upon the Lord , they shall inher@@ it the ear@@ th .
for yet a little while , and the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt dil@@ ig@@ ently consider his place , and it shall not be .
but the me@@ ek shall inher@@ it the ear@@ th ; and shall de@@ light themselves in the ab@@ und@@ ance of peace .
the w@@ ic@@ ked have drawn out the s@@ word , and have b@@ ent their bo@@ w , to cast down the poor and ne@@ edy , and to s@@ lay such as be of u@@ pri@@ ght conversation .
their s@@ word shall enter into their own heart , and their bo@@ ws shall be broken .
for the arms of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be broken : but the Lord up@@ hol@@ de@@ th the righ@@ te@@ ous .
they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med in the ev@@ il time : and in the days of fam@@ ine they shall be satisfied .
but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall per@@ ish , and the enem@@ ies of the Lord shall be as the f@@ at of lam@@ bs : they shall consum@@ e ; into smoke shall they consum@@ e away .
the w@@ ic@@ ked borro@@ w@@ eth , and pay@@ eth not again : but the righ@@ te@@ ous she@@ w@@ eth mer@@ cy , and gi@@ vet@@ h .
for such as be b@@ les@@ sed of him shall inher@@ it the ear@@ th ; and they that be Cur@@ sed of him shall be cut off .
the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord : and he deli@@ gh@@ te@@ th in his way .
though he fall , he shall not be ut@@ ter@@ ly cast down : for the Lord up@@ hol@@ de@@ th him with his hand .
I have been young , and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righ@@ te@@ ous for@@ sak@@ en , nor his se@@ ed beg@@ ging bread .
for the Lord lov@@ eth judgment , and for@@ sak@@ eth not his sa@@ ints ; they are preserved for ever : but the se@@ ed of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be cut off .
the m@@ outh of the righ@@ te@@ ous speak@@ eth wis@@ dom , and his ton@@ gue talk@@ eth of judgment .
the law of his God is in his heart ; none of his steps shall sli@@ de .
the Lord will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is jud@@ ged .
yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : ye@@ a , I sought him , but he could not be found .
mark the perfect man , and be@@ hold the u@@ pri@@ ght : for the end of that man is peace .
but the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall be destroyed together : the end of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be cut off .
but the sal@@ vation of the righ@@ te@@ ous is of the Lord : he is their strength in the time of trouble .
and the Lord shall help them and deliver them : he shall deliver them from the w@@ ic@@ ked , and save them , because they trust in him .
O Lord , re@@ bu@@ ke me not in TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : neither ch@@ as@@ ten me in TH@@ Y hot disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure .
for th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws stick fast in me , and TH@@ Y hand pres@@ set@@ h me sor@@ e .
there is no so@@ und@@ ness in my f@@ les@@ h because of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; neither is there any rest in my b@@ ones because of my sin .
for mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities are gone over mine head : as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me .
for my lo@@ ins are filled with a lo@@ ath@@ some disease : and there is no so@@ und@@ ness in my f@@ les@@ h .
I am fe@@ e@@ ble and sor@@ e broken : I have ro@@ ar@@ ed by reason of the dis@@ qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness of my heart .
Lord , all my desire is before the@@ e ; and my gro@@ an@@ ing is not hi@@ d from the@@ e .
my heart pan@@ te@@ th , my strength fail@@ eth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
my lov@@ ers and my friends stand alo@@ of from my sor@@ e ; and my k@@ ins@@ men stand af@@ ar off .
they also that seek after my life lay s@@ nar@@ es for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous things , and imag@@ ine dec@@ e@@ its all the day long .
but I , as a de@@ af man , heard not ; and I was as a dum@@ b man that open@@ eth not his m@@ outh .
thus I was as a man that he@@ aret@@ h not , and in whose m@@ outh are no re@@ pro@@ of@@ s .
for I said , He@@ ar me , lest otherwise they should re@@ jo@@ ice over me : when my fo@@ ot sli@@ p@@ pet@@ h , they mag@@ ni@@ fy themselves against me .
for I am ready to halt , and my sor@@ row is continu@@ ally before me .
for I will declare mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; I will be sor@@ ry for my sin .
but mine enem@@ ies are li@@ vely , and they are strong : and they that h@@ ate me wrong@@ fully are multi@@ p@@ lied .
they also that ren@@ der ev@@ il for good are mine ad@@ vers@@ aries ; because I follow the thing that good is .
I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my ton@@ gue : I will keep my m@@ outh with a bri@@ dle , while the w@@ ic@@ ked is before me .
I was dum@@ b with sil@@ ence , I held my peace , even from good ; and my sor@@ row was s@@ tir@@ red .
my heart was hot within me , while I was m@@ using the fire burned : then sp@@ ake I with my ton@@ gue ,
Lord , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what it is ; that I may know how fra@@ il I am .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast made my days as an hand@@ b@@ read@@ th ; and mine age is as nothing before the@@ e : veril@@ y every man at his best state is altogether van@@ ity . Se@@ lah .
su@@ rely every man walk@@ eth in a v@@ ain she@@ w : su@@ rely they are dis@@ qu@@ i@@ eted in v@@ ain : he he@@ ap@@ eth up ri@@ ches , and know@@ eth not who shall gather them .
remove TH@@ Y stro@@ ke away from me : I am consu@@ med by the blow of th@@ ine hand .
when th@@ ou with re@@ bu@@ kes dost correct man for in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , th@@ ou mak@@ est his beauty to consum@@ e away like a mo@@ th : su@@ rely every man is van@@ ity . Se@@ lah .
hear my pray@@ er , O Lord , and give e@@ ar un@@ to my cry ; hold not TH@@ Y peace at my te@@ ars : for I am a st@@ ran@@ ger with the@@ e , and a so@@ jour@@ ner , as all my fa@@ thers were .
O spar@@ e me , that I may rec@@ over strength , before I go hence , and be no more .
I w@@ aited pati@@ ently for the Lord ; and he inc@@ lined un@@ to me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of an hor@@ ri@@ ble p@@ it , out of the mir@@ y cla@@ y , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my go@@ ings .
and he hat@@ h put a new song in my m@@ outh , even praise un@@ to our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the Lord .
b@@ les@@ sed is that man that mak@@ eth the Lord his trust , and respec@@ te@@ th not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
sacrifice and offering th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not desire ; mine e@@ ars h@@ ast th@@ ou opened : bur@@ n@@ t offering and sin offering h@@ ast th@@ ou not required .
I have pre@@ ached righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness in the great Con@@ gre@@ gation : lo , I have not ref@@ ra@@ ined my li@@ ps , O Lord , th@@ ou know@@ est .
I have not hi@@ d TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness within my heart ; I have declared TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : I have not conce@@ aled TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and TH@@ Y truth from the great Con@@ gre@@ gation .
with@@ hold not th@@ ou TH@@ Y tender mer@@ cies from me , O Lord : let TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and TH@@ Y truth continu@@ ally preserve me .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded together that seek after my sou@@ l to destroy it ; let them be driven back@@ ward and put to sh@@ ame that wish me ev@@ il .
but I am poor and ne@@ edy ; yet the Lord thin@@ ket@@ h upon me : th@@ ou art my help and my deliver@@ er ; make no tar@@ rying , O my God .
b@@ les@@ sed is he that consider@@ eth the poor : the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be b@@ les@@ sed upon the ear@@ th : and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not deliver him un@@ to the will of his enem@@ ies .
the Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of langu@@ ishing : th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t make all his bed in his si@@ ck@@ ness .
and if he come to see me , he speak@@ eth van@@ ity : his heart gather@@ eth in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to itself ; when he go@@ eth abroad , he tel@@ le@@ th it .
Ye@@ a , mine own familiar friend , in whom I tr@@ usted , which did eat of my bread , hat@@ h lifted up his he@@ el against me .
but th@@ ou , O Lord , be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , and raise me up , that I may requ@@ ite them .
by this I know that th@@ ou fav@@ ou@@ rest me , because mine enemy do@@ th not triumph over me .
and as for me , th@@ ou up@@ hol@@ dest me in mine integrity , and set@@ test me before TH@@ Y face for ever .
my sou@@ l thir@@ ste@@ th for God , for the living God : when shall I come and appear before God ?
yet the Lord will command his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the day@@ time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my pray@@ er un@@ to the God of my life .
why art th@@ ou cast down , O my sou@@ l ? and why art th@@ ou dis@@ qu@@ i@@ eted within me ? hope th@@ ou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my coun@@ tenance , and my God .
judge me , O God , and p@@ lead my cause against an un@@ go@@ dly nation : O deliver me from the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful and un@@ just man .
for th@@ ou art the God of my strength : why dost th@@ ou cast me off ? why go I mourning because of the op@@ pression of the enemy ?
O send out TH@@ Y light and TH@@ Y truth : let them lead me ; let them bring me un@@ to TH@@ Y hol@@ y hill , and to TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
then will I go un@@ to the alt@@ ar of God , un@@ to God my exceeding joy : ye@@ a , upon the har@@ p will I praise the@@ e , O God my God .
we have heard with our e@@ ars , O God , our fa@@ thers have told us , what work th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st in their days , in the times of old .
how th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st drive out the he@@ a@@ then with TH@@ Y hand , and plan@@ ted@@ st them ; how th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st aff@@ lic@@ t the people , and cast them out .
through the@@ e will we push down our enem@@ ies : through TH@@ Y name will we tre@@ ad them under that rise up against us .
for I will not trust in my bo@@ w , neither shall my s@@ word save me .
but th@@ ou h@@ ast sav@@ ed us from our enem@@ ies , and h@@ ast put them to sh@@ ame that ha@@ ted us .
but th@@ ou h@@ ast cast off , and put us to sh@@ ame ; and go@@ est not forth with our armies .
T@@ ho@@ u mak@@ est us to turn back from the enemy : and they which h@@ ate us sp@@ oil for themselves .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast given us like she@@ ep appointed for meat ; and h@@ ast sc@@ at@@ tered us among the he@@ a@@ then .
T@@ ho@@ u mak@@ est us a re@@ pro@@ ach to our neighbours , a scor@@ n and a der@@ ision to them that are round about us .
T@@ ho@@ u mak@@ est us a by@@ word among the he@@ a@@ then , a shak@@ ing of the head among the people .
my conf@@ usion is continu@@ ally before me , and the sh@@ ame of my face hat@@ h covered me ,
all this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten the@@ e , neither have we dealt fal@@ sely in TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
our heart is not turned back , neither have our steps declined from TH@@ Y way ;
though th@@ ou h@@ ast sor@@ e broken us in the place of dra@@ g@@ ons , and covered us with the shadow of death .
if we have forgotten the name of our God , or stret@@ ched out our hands to a st@@ range go@@ d ;
Ye@@ a , for TH@@ Y sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter .
for our sou@@ l is bo@@ wed down to the d@@ ust : our bel@@ ly cle@@ av@@ eth un@@ to the ear@@ th .
my heart is indi@@ ting a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made tou@@ ching the king : my ton@@ gue is the p@@ en of a ready writer .
T@@ ho@@ u art fa@@ i@@ rer than the children of men : grace is p@@ oured into TH@@ Y li@@ ps : therefore God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e for ever .
Th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws are sharp in the heart of the king 's enem@@ ies ; where@@ by the people fall under the@@ e .

K@@ ings ' da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were among TH@@ Y honour@@ able women : upon TH@@ Y right hand did stand the qu@@ een in gold of Op@@ hir .
Hear@@ ken , O daughter , and consider , and inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar ; forget also th@@ ine own people , and TH@@ Y father 's house ;
so shall the king greatly desire TH@@ Y beauty : for he is TH@@ Y Lord ; and worship th@@ ou him .
and the daughter of T@@ y@@ re shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall in@@ treat TH@@ Y favour .
she shall be brought un@@ to the king in ra@@ im@@ ent of ne@@ ed@@ le@@ work : the vir@@ g@@ ins her compan@@ ions that follow her shall be brought un@@ to the@@ e .
with gla@@ d@@ ness and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing shall they be brought : they shall enter into the king 's palace .
instead of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers shall be TH@@ Y children , whom th@@ ou may@@ est make pr@@ inces in all the ear@@ th .
therefore will not we fear , though the ear@@ th be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the mid@@ st of the sea ;
though the waters there@@ of ro@@ ar and be troubled , though the mountains shake with the s@@ wel@@ ling there@@ of . Se@@ lah .
there is a river , the stre@@ ams where@@ of shall make glad the city of God , the hol@@ y place of the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of the most High .
God is in the mid@@ st of her ; she shall not be moved : God shall help her , and that right early .
he mak@@ eth wars to ce@@ ase un@@ to the end of the ear@@ th ; he break@@ eth the bo@@ w , and cut@@ te@@ th the spe@@ ar in s@@ under ; he bur@@ net@@ h the char@@ i@@ ot in the fire .
be still , and know that I am God : I will be ex@@ al@@ ted among the he@@ a@@ then , I will be ex@@ al@@ ted in the ear@@ th .
for the Lord most high is ter@@ ri@@ ble ; he is a great King over all the ear@@ th .
he shall sub@@ due the people under us , and the nations under our feet .
he shall choose our inher@@ it@@ ance for us , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Jac@@ o@@ b whom he lov@@ ed . Se@@ lah .
God is gone up with a sh@@ out , the Lord with the sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et .
God re@@ ig@@ net@@ h over the he@@ a@@ then : God sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of his hol@@ iness .
the pr@@ inces of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham : for the shi@@ elds of the ear@@ th belong un@@ to God : he is greatly ex@@ al@@ ted .
great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised in the city of our God , in the mountain of his hol@@ iness .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole ear@@ th , is mount Z@@ ion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
for , lo , the kings were assemb@@ led , they passed by together .
they saw it , and so they mar@@ v@@ elled ; they were troubled , and has@@ ted away .
as we have heard , so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts , in the city of our God : God will establish it for ever . Se@@ lah .
according to TH@@ Y name , O God , so is TH@@ Y praise un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th : TH@@ Y right hand is full of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let mount Z@@ ion re@@ jo@@ ice , let the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Ju@@ da@@ h be glad , because of TH@@ Y judg@@ ments .
walk about Z@@ ion , and go round about her : tell the tow@@ ers there@@ of .
mark ye well her bul@@ war@@ ks , consider her pal@@ aces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
for this God is our God for ever and ever : he will be our guide even un@@ to death .
my m@@ outh shall speak of wis@@ dom ; and the medi@@ tation of my heart shall be of understanding .
I will inc@@ line mine e@@ ar to a par@@ able : I will open my dark saying upon the har@@ p .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should I fear in the days of ev@@ il , when the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of my he@@ els shall comp@@ ass me about ?
they that trust in their wealth , and bo@@ ast themselves in the multi@@ tude of their ri@@ ches ;
none of them can by any means re@@ de@@ em his brother , nor give to God a ran@@ so@@ m for him :
( for the re@@ dem@@ ption of their sou@@ l is pre@@ ci@@ ous , and it ce@@ as@@ eth for ever : )
for he se@@ eth that wise men die , likewise the fo@@ ol and the bru@@ tish person per@@ ish , and leave their wealth to others .
but God will re@@ de@@ em my sou@@ l from the power of the grave : for he shall receive me . Se@@ lah .
be not th@@ ou afraid when one is made rich , when the gl@@ ory of his house is increased ;
for when he di@@ eth he shall carry nothing away : his gl@@ ory shall not des@@ cen@@ d after him .
though while he lived he b@@ les@@ sed his sou@@ l : and men will praise the@@ e , when th@@ ou do@@ est well to th@@ y@@ self .
man that is in honour , and under@@ stan@@ de@@ th not , is like the be@@ asts that per@@ ish .
the m@@ igh@@ ty God , even the Lord , hat@@ h spoken , and called the ear@@ th from the rising of the sun un@@ to the going down there@@ of .
out of Z@@ ion , the perf@@ ection of beauty , God hat@@ h sh@@ ined .
our God shall come , and shall not keep sil@@ ence : a fire shall dev@@ our before him , and it shall be very temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous round about him .
he shall call to the heav@@ ens from above , and to the ear@@ th , that he may judge his people .
hear , O my people , and I will speak ; O Israel , and I will testify against the@@ e : I am God , even TH@@ Y God .
I will not re@@ prove the@@ e for TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es or TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , to have been continu@@ ally before me .
for every be@@ ast of the forest is mine , and the c@@ attle upon a thousand hil@@ ls .
I know all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the mountains : and the wild be@@ asts of the field are mine .
if I were hun@@ gry , I would not tell the@@ e : for the world is mine , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of .
and call upon me in the day of trouble : I will deliver the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt g@@ lor@@ ify me .
but un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked God sa@@ ith , What h@@ ast th@@ ou to do to declare my stat@@ utes , or that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant in TH@@ Y m@@ outh ?
when th@@ ou sa@@ west a th@@ i@@ ef , then th@@ ou consen@@ ted@@ st with him , and h@@ ast been par@@ tak@@ er with ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers .
T@@ ho@@ u sit@@ test and speak@@ est against TH@@ Y brother ; th@@ ou s@@ lan@@ der@@ est th@@ ine own mother 's son .
W@@ hos@@ o offer@@ eth praise gl@@ ori@@ fi@@ eth me : and to him that or@@ der@@ eth his conversation ar@@ ight will I she@@ w the sal@@ vation of God .
have mer@@ cy upon me , O God , according to TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness : according un@@ to the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y tender mer@@ cies blo@@ t out my trans@@ gres@@ sions .
for I acknowledge my trans@@ gres@@ sions : and my sin is ever before me .
against the@@ e , the@@ e only , have I sin@@ ned , and done this ev@@ il in TH@@ Y sight : that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test be justified when th@@ ou speak@@ est , and be clear when th@@ ou jud@@ gest .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou desi@@ rest truth in the in@@ ward parts : and in the hidden part th@@ ou s@@ halt make me to know wis@@ dom .
pur@@ ge me with hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and I shall be clean : was@@ h me , and I shall be w@@ hi@@ ter than snow .
make me to hear joy and gla@@ d@@ ness ; that the b@@ ones which th@@ ou h@@ ast broken may re@@ jo@@ ice .
hide TH@@ Y face from my sin@@ s , and blo@@ t out all mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
then will I te@@ ach trans@@ gres@@ sors TH@@ Y ways ; and sin@@ ners shall be conver@@ ted un@@ to the@@ e .
O Lord , open th@@ ou my li@@ ps ; and my m@@ outh shall she@@ w forth TH@@ Y praise .
God shall likewise destroy the@@ e for ever , he shall take the@@ e away , and p@@ lu@@ ck the@@ e out of TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and root the@@ e out of the land of the living . Se@@ lah .
the righ@@ te@@ ous also shall see , and fear , and shall la@@ ug@@ h at him :
L@@ o , this is the man that made not God his strength ; but tr@@ usted in the ab@@ und@@ ance of his ri@@ ches , and strengthened himself in his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mer@@ cy of God for ever and ever .
I will praise the@@ e for ever , because th@@ ou h@@ ast done it : and I will wait on TH@@ Y name ; for it is good before TH@@ Y sa@@ ints .
God looked down from heav@@ en upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God .
every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become fil@@ thy ; there is none that do@@ eth good , no , not one .
have the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not called upon God .
O@@ h that the sal@@ vation of Israel were come out of Z@@ ion ! when God br@@ ing@@ eth back the cap@@ tivity of his people , Jac@@ o@@ b shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and Israel shall be glad .
for st@@ ran@@ gers are risen up against me , and op@@ pres@@ sors seek after my sou@@ l : they have not set God before them . Se@@ lah .
be@@ hold , God is mine hel@@ per : the Lord is with them that up@@ hold my sou@@ l .
for he hat@@ h delivered me out of all trouble : and mine eye hat@@ h seen his desire upon mine enem@@ ies .
attend un@@ to me , and hear me : I mour@@ n in my complaint , and make a no@@ ise ;
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the op@@ pression of the w@@ ic@@ ked : for they cast in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity upon me , and in wr@@ ath they h@@ ate me .
my heart is sor@@ e pain@@ ed within me : and the terr@@ ors of death are fallen upon me .
L@@ o , then would I w@@ ander far off , and remain in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . Se@@ lah .
day and night they go about it upon the walls there@@ of : mis@@ chief also and sor@@ row are in the mid@@ st of it .
W@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in the mid@@ st there@@ of : dec@@ e@@ it and gu@@ ile de@@ part not from her streets .
let death se@@ ize upon them , and let them go down quick into hell : for w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in their d@@ wel@@ lings , and among them .
as for me , I will call upon God ; and the Lord shall save me .
evening , and morning , and at noon , will I pra@@ y , and cry al@@ oud : and he shall hear my voice .
he hat@@ h delivered my sou@@ l in peace from the battle that was against me : for there were many with me .
God shall hear , and aff@@ lic@@ t them , even he that abi@@ de@@ th of old . Se@@ lah . because they have no changes , therefore they fear not God .
he hat@@ h put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hat@@ h broken his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
the words of his m@@ outh were smo@@ other than but@@ ter , but war was in his heart : his words were sof@@ ter than oil , yet were they drawn s@@ words .
cast TH@@ Y burden upon the Lord , and he shall sustain the@@ e : he shall never suffer the righ@@ te@@ ous to be moved .
mine enem@@ ies would daily sw@@ allow me up : for they be many that fight against me , O th@@ ou most High .
in God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what f@@ les@@ h can do un@@ to me .
they gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my steps , when they wait for my sou@@ l .
T@@ ho@@ u tel@@ lest my w@@ ander@@ ings : put th@@ ou my te@@ ars into TH@@ Y bot@@ tle : are they not in TH@@ Y book ?
when I cry un@@ to the@@ e , then shall mine enem@@ ies turn back : this I know ; for God is for me .
in God have I put my trust : I will not be afraid what man can do un@@ to me .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered my sou@@ l from death : w@@ il@@ t not th@@ ou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , O God , be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me : for my sou@@ l tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e : ye@@ a , in the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings will I make my ref@@ uge , until these cal@@ am@@ ities be over@@ past .
I will cry un@@ to God most high ; un@@ to God that perfor@@ me@@ th all things for me .
he shall send from heav@@ en , and save from the re@@ pro@@ ach of him that would sw@@ allow me up . Se@@ lah . God shall send forth his mer@@ cy and his truth .
my sou@@ l is among li@@ ons : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose te@@ eth are spe@@ ars and ar@@ ro@@ ws , and their ton@@ gue a sharp s@@ word .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my sou@@ l is bo@@ wed down : they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it before me , into the mid@@ st where@@ of they are fallen themselves . Se@@ lah .
my heart is fixed , O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing and give praise .
for TH@@ Y mer@@ cy is great un@@ to the heav@@ ens , and TH@@ Y truth un@@ to the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
do ye indeed speak righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , O Con@@ gre@@ gation ? do ye judge u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly , O ye sons of men ?
Ye@@ a , in heart ye work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; ye we@@ igh the violence of your hands in the ear@@ th .
the w@@ ic@@ ked are es@@ tran@@ ged from the w@@ om@@ b : they go as@@ tra@@ y as soon as they be born , speaking lies .
their po@@ ison is like the po@@ ison of a ser@@ p@@ ent : they are like the de@@ af ad@@ der that stop@@ pet@@ h her e@@ ar ;
break their te@@ eth , O God , in their m@@ outh : break out the great te@@ eth of the young li@@ ons , O Lord .
let them mel@@ t away as waters which run continu@@ ally : when he ben@@ de@@ th his bo@@ w to sho@@ ot his ar@@ ro@@ ws , let them be as cut in pieces .
before your po@@ ts can feel the thor@@ ns , he shall take them away as with a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , both living , and in his wr@@ ath .
the righ@@ te@@ ous shall re@@ jo@@ ice when he se@@ eth the ven@@ ge@@ ance : he shall was@@ h his feet in the blood of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
deliver me from mine enem@@ ies , O my God : defend me from them that rise up against me .
for , lo , they lie in wait for my sou@@ l : the m@@ igh@@ ty are gathered against me ; not for my trans@@ gres@@ sion , nor for my sin , O Lord .
they return at evening : they make a no@@ ise like a do@@ g , and go round about the city .
but th@@ ou , O Lord , s@@ halt la@@ ug@@ h at them ; th@@ ou s@@ halt have all the he@@ a@@ then in der@@ ision .
the God of my mer@@ cy shall prevent me : God shall let me see my desire upon mine enem@@ ies .
S@@ lay them not , lest my people forget : sc@@ at@@ ter them by TH@@ Y power ; and bring them down , O Lord our shield .
for the sin of their m@@ outh and the words of their li@@ ps let them even be taken in their pride : and for cur@@ sing and lying which they speak .
consum@@ e them in wr@@ ath , consum@@ e them , that they may not be : and let them know that God ru@@ le@@ th in Jac@@ o@@ b un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th . Se@@ lah .
and at evening let them return ; and let them make a no@@ ise like a do@@ g , and go round about the city .
let them w@@ ander up and down for meat , and gru@@ dge if they be not satisfied .
but I will sing of TH@@ Y power ; ye@@ a , I will sing al@@ oud of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy in the morning : for th@@ ou h@@ ast been my defence and ref@@ uge in the day of my trouble .
un@@ to the@@ e , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mer@@ cy .
O God , th@@ ou h@@ ast cast us off , th@@ ou h@@ ast sc@@ at@@ tered us , th@@ ou h@@ ast been disp@@ le@@ ased ; O turn th@@ y@@ self to us again .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made the ear@@ th to tre@@ m@@ ble ; th@@ ou h@@ ast broken it : he@@ al the breaches there@@ of ; for it shak@@ eth .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast she@@ wed TH@@ Y people hard things : th@@ ou h@@ ast made us to drink the wine of ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast given a ban@@ ner to them that fear the@@ e , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Se@@ lah .
God hat@@ h spoken in his hol@@ iness ; I will re@@ jo@@ ice , I will divide Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and M@@ ete out the val@@ ley of Suc@@ co@@ th .
G@@ il@@ e@@ ad is mine , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h is mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im also is the strength of mine head ; Ju@@ da@@ h is my law@@ gi@@ ver ;
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , which h@@ ad@@ st cast us off ? and th@@ ou , O God , which di@@ d@@ st not go out with our armies ?
through God we shall do val@@ i@@ antly : for he it is that shall tre@@ ad down our enem@@ ies .
from the end of the ear@@ th will I cry un@@ to the@@ e , when my heart is overwhel@@ med : lead me to the rock that is higher than I@@ .
I will abide in TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ acle for ever : I will trust in the cover@@ t of TH@@ Y w@@ ings . Se@@ lah .
for th@@ ou , O God , h@@ ast heard my vows : th@@ ou h@@ ast given me the heritage of those that fear TH@@ Y name .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t prol@@ ong the king 's life : and his years as many generations .
he shall abide before God for ever : O prepare mer@@ cy and truth , which may preserve him .
so will I sing praise un@@ to TH@@ Y name for ever , that I may daily perform my vows .
he only is my rock and my sal@@ vation ; he is my defence ; I shall not be greatly moved .
how long will ye imag@@ ine mis@@ chief against a man ? ye shall be sla@@ in all of you : as a bo@@ wing wall shall ye be , and as a tot@@ tering f@@ ence .
they only cons@@ ult to cast him down from his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy : they de@@ light in lies : they b@@ less with their m@@ outh , but they cur@@ se in@@ war@@ dly . Se@@ lah .
he only is my rock and my sal@@ vation : he is my defence ; I shall not be moved .
in God is my sal@@ vation and my gl@@ ory : the rock of my strength , and my ref@@ uge , is in God .
trust in him at all times ; ye people , p@@ our out your heart before him : God is a ref@@ uge for us . Se@@ lah .
su@@ rely men of low degree are van@@ ity , and men of high degree are a lie : to be laid in the balance , they are altogether ligh@@ ter than van@@ ity .
trust not in op@@ pression , and become not v@@ ain in rob@@ bery : if ri@@ ches increase , set not your heart upon them .
also un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , belon@@ get@@ h mer@@ cy : for th@@ ou ren@@ der@@ est to every man according to his work .
O God , th@@ ou art my God ; early will I seek the@@ e : my sou@@ l thir@@ ste@@ th for the@@ e , my f@@ les@@ h lon@@ get@@ h for the@@ e in a d@@ ry and thir@@ st@@ y land , where no water is ;
to see TH@@ Y power and TH@@ Y gl@@ ory , so as I have seen the@@ e in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
thus will I b@@ less the@@ e while I live : I will lift up my hands in TH@@ Y name .
my sou@@ l shall be satisfied as with mar@@ row and fat@@ ness ; and my m@@ outh shall praise the@@ e with jo@@ y@@ ful li@@ ps :
but those that seek my sou@@ l , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the ear@@ th .
they shall fall by the s@@ word : they shall be a portion for fo@@ x@@ es .
but the king shall re@@ jo@@ ice in God ; every one that swe@@ aret@@ h by him shall gl@@ ory : but the m@@ outh of them that speak lies shall be stopped .
hear my voice , O God , in my pray@@ er : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
hide me from the secret coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; from the insur@@ rec@@ tion of the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity :
who wh@@ et their ton@@ gue like a s@@ word , and b@@ end their bo@@ ws to sho@@ ot their ar@@ ro@@ ws , even bitter words :
that they may sho@@ ot in secret at the perfect : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly do they sho@@ ot at him , and fear not .
but God shall sho@@ ot at them with an ar@@ row ; su@@ d@@ den@@ ly shall they be wounded .
so they shall make their own ton@@ gue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
and all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of God ; for they shall wis@@ ely consider of his doing .
I@@ ni@@ qu@@ ities prev@@ ail against me : as for our trans@@ gres@@ sions , th@@ ou s@@ halt pur@@ ge them away .
by ter@@ ri@@ ble things in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou answer us , O God of our sal@@ vation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the ear@@ th , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
which by his strength set@@ te@@ th fast the mountains ; being gir@@ ded with power :
which sti@@ l@@ le@@ th the no@@ ise of the seas , the no@@ ise of their waves , and the t@@ um@@ ult of the people .
they also that d@@ well in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts are afraid at TH@@ Y to@@ ken@@ s : th@@ ou mak@@ est the out@@ go@@ ings of the morning and evening to re@@ jo@@ ice .
T@@ ho@@ u visi@@ test the ear@@ th , and water@@ est it : th@@ ou greatly en@@ rich@@ est it with the river of God , which is full of water : th@@ ou prepar@@ est them cor@@ n , when th@@ ou h@@ ast so provided for it .
T@@ ho@@ u water@@ est the ri@@ dges there@@ of ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly : th@@ ou sett@@ lest the fur@@ ro@@ ws there@@ of : th@@ ou mak@@ est it soft with sho@@ wers : th@@ ou b@@ les@@ s@@ est the spr@@ inging there@@ of .
they drop upon the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and the little hil@@ ls re@@ jo@@ ice on every side .
the pas@@ tures are clo@@ th@@ ed with f@@ loc@@ ks ; the val@@ ley@@ s also are covered over with cor@@ n ; they sh@@ out for joy , they also sing .
all the ear@@ th shall worship the@@ e , and shall sing un@@ to the@@ e ; they shall sing to TH@@ Y name . Se@@ lah .
come and see the works of God : he is ter@@ ri@@ ble in his doing toward the children of men .
he turned the sea into d@@ ry land : they went through the flood on fo@@ ot : there did we re@@ jo@@ ice in him .
he ru@@ le@@ th by his power for ever ; his eyes be@@ hold the nations : let not the rebel@@ li@@ ous ex@@ alt themselves . Se@@ lah .
O b@@ less our God , ye people , and make the voice of his praise to be heard :
which hol@@ de@@ th our sou@@ l in life , and suffer@@ eth not our feet to be moved .
for th@@ ou , O God , h@@ ast proved us : th@@ ou h@@ ast tried us , as silver is tried .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test us out into a wealth@@ y place .
I will go into TH@@ Y house with bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings : I will pay the@@ e my vows ,
which my li@@ ps have ut@@ tered , and my m@@ outh hat@@ h spoken , when I was in trouble .
I will offer un@@ to the@@ e bur@@ n@@ t sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of fat@@ lings , with the incen@@ se of r@@ ams ; I will offer bul@@ loc@@ ks with go@@ ats . Se@@ lah .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to him with my m@@ outh , and he was ex@@ tol@@ led with my ton@@ gue .
if I regard in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
but veril@@ y God hat@@ h heard me ; he hat@@ h attended to the voice of my pray@@ er .
God be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to us , and b@@ less us ; and cause his face to sh@@ ine upon us ; Se@@ lah .
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for th@@ ou s@@ halt judge the people righ@@ te@@ ously , and govern the nations upon ear@@ th . Se@@ lah .
then shall the ear@@ th yield her increase ; and God , even our own God , shall b@@ less us .
let God arise , let his enem@@ ies be sc@@ at@@ tered : let them also that h@@ ate him flee before him .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wa@@ x mel@@ te@@ th before the fire , so let the w@@ ic@@ ked per@@ ish at the presence of God .
but let the righ@@ te@@ ous be glad ; let them re@@ jo@@ ice before God : ye@@ a , let them exce@@ ed@@ ingly re@@ jo@@ ice .
a father of the fa@@ ther@@ less , and a judge of the wi@@ dows , is God in his hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
God set@@ te@@ th the sol@@ itary in families : he br@@ ing@@ eth out those which are bound with cha@@ ins : but the rebel@@ li@@ ous d@@ well in a d@@ ry land .
O God , when th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test forth before TH@@ Y people , when th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st march through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; Se@@ lah :
the ear@@ th sho@@ ok , the heav@@ ens also dropped at the presence of God : even S@@ ina@@ i itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u , O God , di@@ d@@ st send a plen@@ ti@@ ful rain , where@@ by th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st confirm th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , when it was we@@ ary .
TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation hat@@ h d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in : th@@ ou , O God , h@@ ast prepared of TH@@ Y Go@@ od@@ ness for the poor .
though ye have li@@ en among the po@@ ts , yet shall ye be as the w@@ ings of a do@@ ve covered with silver , and her fe@@ ath@@ ers with yel@@ low gold .
why le@@ ap ye , ye high hil@@ ls ? this is the hill which God desi@@ re@@ th to d@@ well in ; ye@@ a , the Lord will d@@ well in it for ever .
the char@@ i@@ ots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of an@@ gel@@ s : the Lord is among them , as in S@@ ina@@ i , in the hol@@ y place .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast as@@ cen@@ ded on high , th@@ ou h@@ ast led cap@@ tivity cap@@ tive : th@@ ou h@@ ast received gifts for men ; ye@@ a , for the rebel@@ li@@ ous also , that the Lord God might d@@ well among them .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , who daily lo@@ ade@@ th us with benefits , even the God of our sal@@ vation . Se@@ lah .
he that is our God is the God of sal@@ vation ; and un@@ to God the Lord belong the issues from death .
but God shall wo@@ und the head of his enem@@ ies , and the ha@@ iry scal@@ p of such an one as go@@ eth on still in his t@@ res@@ passes .
the Lord said , I will bring again from B@@ ash@@ an , I will bring my people again from the dep@@ ths of the sea :
they have seen TH@@ Y go@@ ings , O God ; even the go@@ ings of my God , my King , in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; among them were the dam@@ sels playing with tim@@ bre@@ ls .
there is little Benjamin with their ru@@ ler , the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h and their council , the pr@@ inces of Ze@@ bul@@ un , and the pr@@ inces of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
pr@@ inces shall come out of Egypt ; Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia shall soon stretch out her hands un@@ to God .
to him that ri@@ de@@ th upon the heav@@ ens of heav@@ ens , which were of old ; lo , he do@@ th send out his voice , and that a m@@ igh@@ ty voice .
As@@ cri@@ be ye strength un@@ to God : his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy is over Israel , and his strength is in the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
I s@@ ink in deep m@@ ire , where there is no standing : I am come into deep waters , where the floods over@@ flow me .
I am we@@ ary of my cr@@ ying : my thro@@ at is dri@@ ed : mine eyes fail while I wait for my God .
they that h@@ ate me without a cause are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully , are m@@ igh@@ ty : then I restored that which I took not away .
O God , th@@ ou know@@ est my fo@@ ol@@ ishness ; and my sin@@ s are not hi@@ d from the@@ e .
let not them that wait on the@@ e , O Lord God of hosts , be as@@ ha@@ med for my sake : let not those that seek the@@ e be con@@ founded for my sake , O God of Israel .
because for TH@@ Y sake I have bor@@ ne re@@ pro@@ ach ; sh@@ ame hat@@ h covered my face .
I am become a st@@ ran@@ ger un@@ to my bre@@ th@@ ren , and an ali@@ en un@@ to my mother 's children .
for the z@@ e@@ al of th@@ ine house hat@@ h e@@ aten me up ; and the re@@ pro@@ aches of them that re@@ pro@@ ached the@@ e are fallen upon me .
when I we@@ pt , and ch@@ as@@ tened my sou@@ l with fas@@ ting , that was to my re@@ pro@@ ach .
I made s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th also my gar@@ ment ; and I became a pro@@ ver@@ b to them .
they that sit in the gate speak against me ; and I was the song of the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds .
but as for me , my pray@@ er is un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy hear me , in the truth of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
deliver me out of the m@@ ire , and let me not s@@ ink : let me be delivered from them that h@@ ate me , and out of the deep waters .
let not the water@@ flood over@@ flow me , neither let the deep sw@@ allow me up , and let not the p@@ it shut her m@@ outh upon me .
hear me , O Lord ; for TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness is good : turn un@@ to me according to the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y tender mer@@ cies .
and hide not TH@@ Y face from TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for I am in trouble : hear me spe@@ edil@@ y .
draw n@@ igh un@@ to my sou@@ l , and re@@ de@@ em it : deliver me because of mine enem@@ ies .
re@@ pro@@ ach hat@@ h broken my heart ; and I am full of heav@@ iness : and I looked for some to take p@@ ity , but there was none ; and for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
they gave me also g@@ all for my meat ; and in my thir@@ st they gave me vin@@ eg@@ ar to drink .
let their table become a sn@@ are before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a tra@@ p .
let their eyes be dar@@ ken@@ ed , that they see not ; and make their lo@@ ins continu@@ ally to shake .
p@@ our out th@@ ine in@@ dign@@ ation upon them , and let TH@@ Y wra@@ th@@ ful an@@ ger take hold of them .
let their habi@@ tation be de@@ so@@ late ; and let none d@@ well in their ten@@ ts .
for they persec@@ ute him whom th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ mit@@ ten ; and they talk to the gri@@ ef of those whom th@@ ou h@@ ast wounded .
add in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity un@@ to their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : and let them not come into TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let them be blo@@ t@@ ted out of the book of the living , and not be written with the righ@@ te@@ ous .
I will praise the name of God with a song , and will mag@@ ni@@ fy him with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
the hum@@ ble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall live that seek God .
for God will save Z@@ ion , and will build the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h : that they may d@@ well there , and have it in possession .
the se@@ ed also of his servants shall inher@@ it it : and they that love his name shall d@@ well there@@ in .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded that seek after my sou@@ l : let them be turned back@@ ward , and put to conf@@ usion , that desire my hurt .
let all those that seek the@@ e re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad in the@@ e : and let such as love TH@@ Y sal@@ vation say continu@@ ally , Let God be mag@@ ni@@ fied .
but I am poor and ne@@ edy : make has@@ te un@@ to me , O God : th@@ ou art my help and my deliver@@ er ; O Lord , make no tar@@ rying .
in the@@ e , O Lord , do I put my trust : let me never be put to conf@@ usion .
deliver me in TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and cause me to escape : inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar un@@ to me , and save me .
be th@@ ou my strong habi@@ tation , where@@ un@@ to I may continu@@ ally resort : th@@ ou h@@ ast given comman@@ d@@ ment to save me ; for th@@ ou art my rock and my fortress .
deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , out of the hand of the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous and cru@@ el man .
by the@@ e have I been hol@@ den up from the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou art he that took me out of my mother 's bo@@ wel@@ s : my praise shall be continu@@ ally of the@@ e .
cast me not off in the time of old age ; for@@ sake me not when my strength fail@@ eth .
for mine enem@@ ies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my sou@@ l take coun@@ sel together ,
let them be con@@ founded and consu@@ med that are ad@@ vers@@ aries to my sou@@ l ; let them be covered with re@@ pro@@ ach and dis@@ honour that seek my hurt .
my m@@ outh shall she@@ w forth TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and TH@@ Y sal@@ vation all the day ; for I know not the numbers there@@ of .
I will go in the strength of the Lord God : I will make mention of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , even of th@@ ine only .
O God , th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught me from my youth : and hi@@ ther@@ to have I declared TH@@ Y won@@ dro@@ us works .
now also when I am old and gr@@ ay@@ headed , O God , for@@ sake me not ; until I have she@@ wed TH@@ Y strength un@@ to this generation , and TH@@ Y power to every one that is to come .
TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness also , O God , is very high , who h@@ ast done great things : O God , who is like un@@ to the@@ e !
T@@ ho@@ u , which h@@ ast she@@ wed me great and sor@@ e troub@@ les , s@@ halt quic@@ ken me again , and s@@ halt bring me up again from the dep@@ ths of the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt increase my gre@@ at@@ ness , and comfor@@ t me on every side .
I will also praise the@@ e with the p@@ sal@@ tery , even TH@@ Y truth , O my God : un@@ to the@@ e will I sing with the har@@ p , O th@@ ou Holy One of Israel .
my ton@@ gue also shall talk of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness all the day long : for they are con@@ founded , for they are brought un@@ to sh@@ ame , that seek my hurt .
the mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little hil@@ ls , by righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the ne@@ edy , and shall break in pieces the op@@ pres@@ sor .
in his days shall the righ@@ te@@ ous flo@@ ur@@ ish ; and ab@@ und@@ ance of peace so long as the moon en@@ du@@ re@@ th .
he shall have domin@@ ion also from sea to sea , and from the river un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
they that d@@ well in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness shall bo@@ w before him ; and his enem@@ ies shall lick the d@@ ust .
the kings of Tar@@ sh@@ ish and of the is@@ les shall bring presents : the kings of She@@ ba and S@@ eb@@ a shall offer gifts .
for he shall deliver the ne@@ edy when he cri@@ eth ; the poor also , and him that hat@@ h no hel@@ per .
he shall spar@@ e the poor and ne@@ edy , and shall save the so@@ ul@@ s of the ne@@ edy .
he shall re@@ de@@ em their sou@@ l from dec@@ e@@ it and violence : and pre@@ ci@@ ous shall their blood be in his sight .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of She@@ ba : pray@@ er also shall be made for him continu@@ ally ; and daily shall he be praised .
there shall be an hand@@ ful of cor@@ n in the ear@@ th upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit there@@ of shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
and b@@ les@@ sed be his g@@ lor@@ ious name for ever : and let the whole ear@@ th be filled with his gl@@ ory ; A@@ men , and A@@ men .
truly God is good to Israel , even to such as are of a clean heart .
for I was en@@ vi@@ ous at the fo@@ ol@@ ish , when I saw the prosperity of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
for there are no bands in their death : but their strength is firm .
they are not in trouble as other men ; neither are they plagued like other men .
they set their m@@ outh against the heav@@ ens , and their ton@@ gue walk@@ eth through the ear@@ th .
therefore his people return hi@@ ther : and waters of a full c@@ up are wr@@ ung out to them .
be@@ hold , these are the un@@ go@@ dly , who prosp@@ er in the world ; they increase in ri@@ ches .
su@@ rely th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st set them in sli@@ p@@ per@@ y places : th@@ ou cas@@ ted@@ st them down into destruction .
how are they brought into de@@ so@@ lation , as in a moment ! they are ut@@ ter@@ ly consu@@ med with terr@@ ors .
thus my heart was gri@@ ev@@ ed , and I was pri@@ cked in my re@@ ins .
so fo@@ ol@@ ish was I , and ignor@@ ant : I was as a be@@ ast before the@@ e .
nevertheless I am continu@@ ally with the@@ e : th@@ ou h@@ ast hol@@ den me by my right hand .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt guide me with TH@@ Y coun@@ sel , and after@@ ward receive me to gl@@ ory .
whom have I in heav@@ en but the@@ e ? and there is none upon ear@@ th that I desire bes@@ ide the@@ e .
my f@@ les@@ h and my heart fail@@ eth : but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever .
for , lo , they that are far from the@@ e shall per@@ ish : th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed all them that go a wh@@ oring from the@@ e .
but it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord God , that I may declare all TH@@ Y works .
O God , why h@@ ast th@@ ou cast us off for ever ? why do@@ th th@@ ine an@@ ger smoke against the she@@ ep of TH@@ Y pas@@ ture ?
remember TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased of old ; the ro@@ d of th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed ; this mount Z@@ ion , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast d@@ wel@@ t .
lift up TH@@ Y feet un@@ to the perpet@@ ual de@@ so@@ lations ; even all that the enemy hat@@ h done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
a man was famous according as he had lifted up ax@@ es upon the th@@ ick trees .
but now they break down the car@@ ved work there@@ of at once with ax@@ es and ham@@ mers .
they have cast fire into TH@@ Y sanc@@ tu@@ ary , they have def@@ iled by casting down the d@@ wel@@ ling place of TH@@ Y name to the ground .
we see not our signs : there is no more any pro@@ phe@@ t : neither is there among us any that know@@ eth how long .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st divide the sea by TH@@ Y strength : th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est the heads of the dra@@ g@@ ons in the waters .
T@@ ho@@ u br@@ ak@@ est the heads of le@@ vi@@ athan in pieces , and g@@ av@@ est him to be meat to the people inhabi@@ ting the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
O deliver not the sou@@ l of TH@@ Y tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve un@@ to the multi@@ tude of the w@@ ic@@ ked : forget not the Con@@ gre@@ gation of TH@@ Y poor for ever .
have respect un@@ to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : for the dark places of the ear@@ th are full of the habi@@ tations of cru@@ el@@ ty .
forget not the voice of th@@ ine enem@@ ies : the t@@ um@@ ult of those that rise up against the@@ e increas@@ eth continu@@ ally .
un@@ to the@@ e , O God , do we give thanks , un@@ to the@@ e do we give thanks : for that TH@@ Y name is near TH@@ Y won@@ dro@@ us works declare .
the ear@@ th and all the inhabitants there@@ of are dis@@ solved : I bear up the pil@@ lars of it . Se@@ lah .
but God is the judge : he p@@ ut@@ te@@ th down one , and set@@ te@@ th up another .
but I will declare for ever ; I will sing pra@@ ises to the God of Jac@@ o@@ b .
all the hor@@ ns of the w@@ ic@@ ked also will I cut off ; but the hor@@ ns of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
in Sal@@ em also is his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and his d@@ wel@@ ling place in Z@@ ion .
there br@@ ake he the ar@@ ro@@ ws of the bo@@ w , the shield , and the s@@ word , and the battle . Se@@ lah .
the st@@ ou@@ the@@ ar@@ ted are sp@@ o@@ iled , they have sle@@ pt their sle@@ ep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
at TH@@ Y re@@ bu@@ ke , O God of Jac@@ o@@ b , both the char@@ i@@ ot and hor@@ se are cast into a dead sle@@ ep .
T@@ ho@@ u , even th@@ ou , art to be fear@@ ed : and who may stand in TH@@ Y sight when once th@@ ou art angry ?
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st cause judgment to be heard from heav@@ en ; the ear@@ th fear@@ ed , and was still ,
vo@@ w , and pay un@@ to the Lord your God : let all that be round about him bring presents un@@ to him that ought to be fear@@ ed .
he shall cut off the spirit of pr@@ inces : he is ter@@ ri@@ ble to the kings of the ear@@ th .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to God with my voice , even un@@ to God with my voice ; and he gave e@@ ar un@@ to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sor@@ e ran in the night , and ce@@ ased not : my sou@@ l refused to be comfor@@ ted .
I remember@@ ed God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was overwhel@@ med . Se@@ lah .
T@@ ho@@ u hol@@ dest mine eyes w@@ ak@@ ing : I am so troubled that I can@@ not speak .
I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
I call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance my song in the night : I commun@@ e with mine own heart : and my spirit made dil@@ ig@@ ent search .
I will remember the works of the Lord : su@@ rely I will remember TH@@ Y won@@ ders of old .
TH@@ Y way , O God , is in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : who is so great a God as our God ?
T@@ ho@@ u art the God that do@@ est won@@ ders : th@@ ou h@@ ast declared TH@@ Y strength among the people .
the waters saw the@@ e , O God , the waters saw the@@ e ; they were afraid : the dep@@ ths also were troubled .
the cl@@ ou@@ ds p@@ oured out water : the sk@@ ies sent out a sound : th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws also went abroad .
the voice of TH@@ Y Th@@ under was in the heav@@ en : the ligh@@ t@@ nings ligh@@ tened the world : the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and sho@@ ok .
TH@@ Y way is in the sea , and TH@@ Y path in the great waters , and TH@@ Y foot@@ steps are not known .
give e@@ ar , O my people , to my law : inc@@ line your e@@ ars to the words of my m@@ outh .
I will open my m@@ outh in a par@@ able : I will ut@@ ter dark say@@ ings of old :
we will not hide them from their children , she@@ wing to the generation to come the pra@@ ises of the Lord , and his strength , and his won@@ der@@ ful works that he hat@@ h done .
for he established a testimony in Jac@@ o@@ b , and appointed a law in Israel , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers , that they should make them known to their children :
that the generation to come might know them , even the children which should be born ; who should arise and declare them to their children :
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his comman@@ d@@ ments :
and might not be as their fa@@ thers , a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ar@@ ight , and whose spirit was not ste@@ d@@ fast with God .
the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , being armed , and carrying bo@@ ws , turned back in the day of battle .
and for@@ g@@ at his works , and his won@@ ders that he had she@@ wed them .
Mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous things did he in the sight of their fa@@ thers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zo@@ an .
he divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made the waters to stand as an he@@ ap .
in the day@@ time also he led them with a cl@@ oud , and all the night with a light of fire .
he cla@@ ve the ro@@ cks in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and gave them drink as out of the great dep@@ ths .
he brought stre@@ ams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
and they temp@@ ted God in their heart by asking meat for their l@@ ust .
be@@ hold , he smo@@ te the rock , that the waters gus@@ hed out , and the stre@@ ams over@@ flow@@ ed ; can he give bread also ? can he provide f@@ les@@ h for his people ?
therefore the Lord heard this , and was wro@@ th : so a fire was kin@@ d@@ led against Jac@@ o@@ b , and an@@ ger also came up against Israel ;
because they believed not in God , and tr@@ usted not in his sal@@ vation :
and had ra@@ ined down man@@ na upon them to eat , and had given them of the cor@@ n of heav@@ en .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heav@@ en : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
he ra@@ ined f@@ les@@ h also upon them as d@@ ust , and fe@@ a@@ ther@@ ed fo@@ w@@ ls like as the s@@ and of the sea :
and he let it fall in the mid@@ st of their camp , round about their habi@@ tations .
they were not es@@ tran@@ ged from their l@@ ust . but while their meat was yet in their m@@ ou@@ ths ,
the wr@@ ath of God came upon them , and sle@@ w the fat@@ test of them , and smo@@ te down the chosen men of Israel .
when he sle@@ w them , then they sought him : and they returned and inqu@@ ired early after God .
nevertheless they did f@@ latter him with their m@@ outh , and they lied un@@ to him with their ton@@ gues .
for their heart was not right with him , neither were they ste@@ d@@ fast in his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
but he , being full of comp@@ as@@ sion , for@@ gave their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and destroyed them not : ye@@ a , many a time turned he his an@@ ger away , and did not stir up all his wr@@ ath .
for he remember@@ ed that they were but f@@ les@@ h ; a wind that pass@@ eth away , and co@@ me@@ th not again .
Ye@@ a , they turned back and temp@@ ted God , and limited the Holy One of Israel .
they remember@@ ed not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy .
how he had w@@ rought his signs in Egypt , and his won@@ ders in the field of Zo@@ an :
and had turned their rivers into blood ; and their floods , that they could not drink .
he sent di@@ vers sor@@ ts of f@@ lies among them , which dev@@ oured them ; and fro@@ gs , which destroyed them .
he gave also their increase un@@ to the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler , and their labour un@@ to the loc@@ ust .
he gave up their c@@ attle also to the ha@@ il , and their f@@ loc@@ ks to hot th@@ under@@ bol@@ ts .
he cast upon them the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger , wr@@ ath , and in@@ dign@@ ation , and trouble , by sending ev@@ il an@@ gel@@ s among them .
he made a way to his an@@ ger ; he spar@@ ed not their sou@@ l from death , but gave their life over to the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
and smo@@ te all the fir@@ st@@ born in Egypt ; the chief of their strength in the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of ham :
but made his own people to go forth like she@@ ep , and gui@@ ded them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like a flock .
and he led them on saf@@ ely , so that they fear@@ ed not : but the sea overwhel@@ med their enem@@ ies .
and he brought them to the border of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even to this mountain , which his right hand had purchased .
he cast out the he@@ a@@ then also before them , and divided them an inher@@ it@@ ance by line , and made the tri@@ bes of Israel to d@@ well in their ten@@ ts .
but turned back , and dealt un@@ fa@@ ith@@ fully like their fa@@ thers : they were turned aside like a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful bo@@ w .
for they provoked him to an@@ ger with their high places , and moved him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their Gra@@ ven images .
so that he for@@ so@@ ok the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , the tent which he placed among men ;
he gave his people over also un@@ to the s@@ word ; and was wro@@ th with his inher@@ it@@ ance .
the fire consu@@ med their young men ; and their ma@@ i@@ den@@ s were not given to marriage .
then the Lord aw@@ aked as one out of sle@@ ep , and like a m@@ igh@@ ty man that sh@@ ou@@ te@@ th by reason of wine .
and he smo@@ te his enem@@ ies in the hin@@ der parts : he put them to a perpet@@ ual re@@ pro@@ ach .
moreover he refused the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Joseph , and chose not the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im :
and he built his sanc@@ tu@@ ary like high pal@@ aces , like the ear@@ th which he hat@@ h established for ever .
so he f@@ ed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and gui@@ ded them by the s@@ kil@@ ful@@ ness of his hands .
O God , the he@@ a@@ then are come into th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance ; TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le have they def@@ iled ; they have laid Jer@@ usalem on he@@ aps .
the dead bodies of TH@@ Y servants have they given to be meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sa@@ ints un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
their blood have they shed like water round about Jer@@ usalem ; and there was none to bur@@ y them .
we are become a re@@ pro@@ ach to our neighbours , a scor@@ n and der@@ ision to them that are round about us .
p@@ our out TH@@ Y wr@@ ath upon the he@@ a@@ then that have not known the@@ e , and upon the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms that have not called upon TH@@ Y name .
O remember not against us former in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities : let TH@@ Y tender mer@@ cies spe@@ edil@@ y prevent us : for we are brought very low .
help us , O God of our sal@@ vation , for the gl@@ ory of TH@@ Y name : and deliver us , and pur@@ ge away our sin@@ s , for TH@@ Y name 's sake .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should the he@@ a@@ then say , W@@ here is their God ? let him be known among the he@@ a@@ then in our sight by the reven@@ ging of the blood of TH@@ Y servants which is shed .
let the si@@ gh@@ ing of the prison@@ er come before the@@ e ; according to the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y power preserve th@@ ou those that are appointed to die ;
and ren@@ der un@@ to our neighbours se@@ ven@@ fold into their bos@@ om their re@@ pro@@ ach , where@@ with they have re@@ pro@@ ached the@@ e , O Lord .
so we TH@@ Y people and she@@ ep of TH@@ Y pas@@ ture will give the@@ e thanks for ever : we will she@@ w forth TH@@ Y praise to all generations .
turn us again , O God , and cause TH@@ Y face to sh@@ ine ; and we shall be sav@@ ed .
T@@ ho@@ u fe@@ ede@@ st them with the bread of te@@ ars ; and gi@@ v@@ est them te@@ ars to drink in great measure .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast brought a v@@ ine out of Egypt : th@@ ou h@@ ast cast out the he@@ a@@ then , and plan@@ ted it .
T@@ ho@@ u prepar@@ ed@@ st room before it , and di@@ d@@ st cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
the hil@@ ls were covered with the shadow of it , and the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of were like the good@@ ly c@@ ed@@ ars .
she sent out her b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s un@@ to the sea , and her branches un@@ to the river .
why h@@ ast th@@ ou then broken down her h@@ ed@@ ges , so that all they which pass by the way do p@@ lu@@ ck her ?
the Bo@@ ar out of the wood do@@ th waste it , and the wild be@@ ast of the field do@@ th dev@@ our it .
and the v@@ ine@@ yard which TH@@ Y right hand hat@@ h plan@@ ted , and the branch that th@@ ou ma@@ dest strong for th@@ y@@ self .
it is burned with fire , it is cut down : they per@@ ish at the re@@ bu@@ ke of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance .
let TH@@ Y hand be upon the man of TH@@ Y right hand , upon the son of man whom th@@ ou ma@@ dest strong for th@@ y@@ self .
so will not we go back from the@@ e : quic@@ ken us , and we will call upon TH@@ Y name .
for this was a statute for Israel , and a law of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b .
this he or@@ da@@ ined in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
T@@ ho@@ u cal@@ led@@ st in trouble , and I delivered the@@ e ; I answ@@ ered the@@ e in the secret place of Th@@ under : I proved the@@ e at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah . Se@@ lah .
hear , O my people , and I will testify un@@ to the@@ e : O Israel , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t he@@ arken un@@ to me ;
there shall no st@@ range go@@ d be in the@@ e ; neither s@@ halt th@@ ou worship any st@@ range go@@ d .
I am the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt : open TH@@ Y m@@ outh wide , and I will fill it .
so I gave them up un@@ to their own hear@@ ts ' l@@ ust : and they walked in their own coun@@ sels .
O@@ h that my people had hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me , and Israel had walked in my ways !
I should soon have sub@@ du@@ ed their enem@@ ies , and turned my hand against their ad@@ vers@@ aries .
the hat@@ ers of the Lord should have submitted themselves un@@ to him : but their time should have en@@ du@@ red for ever .
he should have f@@ ed them also with the fin@@ est of the wheat : and with hon@@ ey out of the rock should I have satisfied the@@ e .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in d@@ ark@@ ness : all the foundations of the ear@@ th are out of course .
keep not th@@ ou sil@@ ence , O God : hold not TH@@ Y peace , and be not still , O God .
for , lo , th@@ ine enem@@ ies make a t@@ um@@ ult : and they that h@@ ate the@@ e have lifted up the head .
they have said , C@@ ome , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance .
the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of E@@ dom , and the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes ; of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the Hag@@ aren@@ es ;
As@@ sur also is joined with them : they have hol@@ p@@ en the children of lot . Se@@ lah .
do un@@ to them as un@@ to the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ; as to Sis@@ era , as to J@@ ab@@ in , at the Bro@@ ok of K@@ ison :
make their no@@ bles like O@@ re@@ b , and like Ze@@ e@@ b : ye@@ a , all their pr@@ inces as Z@@ eb@@ ah , and as Zal@@ mun@@ na :
as the fire bur@@ net@@ h a wood , and as the fla@@ me set@@ te@@ th the mountains on fire ;
so persec@@ ute them with TH@@ Y temp@@ est , and make them afraid with TH@@ Y storm .
fill their faces with sh@@ ame ; that they may seek TH@@ Y name , O Lord .
let them be con@@ founded and troubled for ever ; ye@@ a , let them be put to sh@@ ame , and per@@ ish :
that men may know that th@@ ou , whose name alone is J@@ eh@@ ov@@ ah , art the most high over all the ear@@ th .
my sou@@ l lon@@ get@@ h , ye@@ a , even fa@@ in@@ te@@ th for the courts of the Lord : my heart and my f@@ les@@ h cri@@ eth out for the living God .
b@@ les@@ sed are they that d@@ well in TH@@ Y house : they will be still praising the@@ e . Se@@ lah .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man whose strength is in the@@ e ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
they go from strength to strength , every one of them in Z@@ ion appe@@ aret@@ h before God .
for a day in TH@@ Y courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a do@@ or@@ keep@@ er in the house of my God , than to d@@ well in the ten@@ ts of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
for the Lord God is a sun and shield : the Lord will give grace and gl@@ ory : no good thing will he with@@ hold from them that walk u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly .
Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast been favourable un@@ to TH@@ Y land : th@@ ou h@@ ast brought back the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast for@@ given the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of TH@@ Y people , th@@ ou h@@ ast covered all their sin . Se@@ lah .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast taken away all TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : th@@ ou h@@ ast turned th@@ y@@ self from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of th@@ ine an@@ ger .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou be angry with us for ever ? w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou draw out th@@ ine an@@ ger to all generations ?
I will hear what God the Lord will speak : for he will speak peace un@@ to his people , and to his sa@@ ints : but let them not turn again to Fol@@ ly .
mer@@ cy and truth are met together ; righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and peace have k@@ is@@ sed each other .
truth shall spring out of the ear@@ th ; and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall look down from heav@@ en .
Ye@@ a , the Lord shall give that which is good ; and our land shall yield her increase .
R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
preserve my sou@@ l ; for I am hol@@ y : O th@@ ou my God , save TH@@ Y ser@@ vant that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e .
re@@ jo@@ ice the sou@@ l of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : for un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , do I lift up my sou@@ l .
for th@@ ou , Lord , art good , and ready to for@@ give ; and plen@@ te@@ ous in mer@@ cy un@@ to all them that call upon the@@ e .
give e@@ ar , O Lord , un@@ to my pray@@ er ; and attend to the voice of my supp@@ lic@@ ations .
in the day of my trouble I will call upon the@@ e : for th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t answer me .
among the go@@ ds there is none like un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord ; neither are there any works like un@@ to TH@@ Y works .
all nations whom th@@ ou h@@ ast made shall come and worship before the@@ e , O Lord ; and shall g@@ lor@@ ify TH@@ Y name .
I will praise the@@ e , O Lord my God , with all my heart : and I will g@@ lor@@ ify TH@@ Y name for ever@@ more .
for great is TH@@ Y mer@@ cy toward me : and th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered my sou@@ l from the lowest hell .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemb@@ lies of violent men have sought after my sou@@ l ; and have not set the@@ e before them .
O turn un@@ to me , and have mer@@ cy upon me ; give TH@@ Y strength un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and save the son of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
She@@ w me a to@@ ken for good ; that they which h@@ ate me may see it , and be as@@ ha@@ med : because th@@ ou , Lord , h@@ ast hol@@ p@@ en me , and comfor@@ ted me .
for my sou@@ l is full of troub@@ les : and my life dra@@ w@@ eth n@@ igh un@@ to the grave .
I am counted with them that go down into the p@@ it : I am as a man that hat@@ h no strength :
free among the dead , like the sla@@ in that lie in the grave , whom th@@ ou remember@@ est no more : and they are cut off from TH@@ Y hand .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast laid me in the lowest p@@ it , in d@@ ark@@ ness , in the deep@@ s .
TH@@ Y wr@@ ath li@@ eth hard upon me , and th@@ ou h@@ ast aff@@ lic@@ ted me with all TH@@ Y waves . Se@@ lah .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put away mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance far from me ; th@@ ou h@@ ast made me an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to them : I am shut up , and I can@@ not come forth .
mine eye mour@@ net@@ h by reason of aff@@ li@@ ction : Lord , I have called daily upon the@@ e , I have stret@@ ched out my hands un@@ to the@@ e .
shall TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness be declared in the grave ? or TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness in destruction ?
shall TH@@ Y won@@ ders be known in the dark ? and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness in the land of for@@ get@@ ful@@ ness ?
I am aff@@ lic@@ ted and ready to die from my youth up : while I suffer TH@@ Y terr@@ ors I am dist@@ rac@@ ted .
L@@ over and friend h@@ ast th@@ ou put far from me , and mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance into d@@ ark@@ ness .
I will sing of the mer@@ cies of the Lord for ever : with my m@@ outh will I make known TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness to all generations .
for I have said , Mer@@ cy shall be built up for ever : TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness s@@ halt th@@ ou establish in the very heav@@ ens .
and the heav@@ ens shall praise TH@@ Y won@@ ders , O Lord : TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness also in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the sa@@ ints .
for who in the heav@@ en can be compared un@@ to the Lord ? who among the sons of the m@@ igh@@ ty can be lik@@ ened un@@ to the Lord ?
God is greatly to be fear@@ ed in the assembly of the sa@@ ints , and to be had in rever@@ ence of all them that are about him .
T@@ ho@@ u ru@@ lest the ra@@ ging of the sea : when the waves there@@ of arise , th@@ ou sti@@ l@@ lest them .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast broken Ra@@ ha@@ b in pieces , as one that is sla@@ in ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sc@@ at@@ tered th@@ ine enem@@ ies with TH@@ Y strong arm .
the heav@@ ens are th@@ ine , the ear@@ th also is th@@ ine : as for the world and the ful@@ ness there@@ of , th@@ ou h@@ ast founded them .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast a m@@ igh@@ ty arm : strong is TH@@ Y hand , and high is TH@@ Y right hand .
justice and judgment are the habi@@ tation of TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one : mer@@ cy and truth shall go before TH@@ Y face .
b@@ les@@ sed is the people that know the jo@@ y@@ ful sound : they shall walk , O Lord , in the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance .
in TH@@ Y name shall they re@@ jo@@ ice all the day : and in TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall they be ex@@ al@@ ted .
for th@@ ou art the gl@@ ory of their strength : and in TH@@ Y favour our Hor@@ n shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
for the Lord is our defence ; and the Holy One of Israel is our king .
then th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est in vision to TH@@ Y hol@@ y one , and sa@@ id@@ st , I have laid help upon one that is m@@ igh@@ ty ; I have ex@@ al@@ ted one chosen out of the people .
I have found David my ser@@ vant ; with my hol@@ y oil have I ano@@ in@@ ted him :
with whom my hand shall be established : mine arm also shall strengthen him .
and I will beat down his fo@@ es before his face , and pla@@ gue them that h@@ ate him .
but my fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and my mer@@ cy shall be with him : and in my name shall his Hor@@ n be ex@@ al@@ ted .
I will set his hand also in the sea , and his right hand in the rivers .
he shall cry un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u art my father , my God , and the rock of my sal@@ vation .
my mer@@ cy will I keep for him for ever@@ more , and my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall stand fast with him .
his se@@ ed also will I make to en@@ dur@@ e for ever , and his th@@ r@@ one as the days of heav@@ en .
if they break my stat@@ utes , and keep not my comman@@ d@@ ments ;
then will I visit their trans@@ gres@@ sion with the ro@@ d , and their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity with stri@@ pes .
nevertheless my lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness will I not ut@@ ter@@ ly take from him , nor suffer my fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness to fail .
my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant will I not break , nor al@@ ter the thing that is gone out of my li@@ ps .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made vo@@ id the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : th@@ ou h@@ ast prof@@ an@@ ed his cro@@ wn by casting it to the ground .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast broken down all his h@@ ed@@ ges ; th@@ ou h@@ ast brought his strong holds to ru@@ in .
all that pass by the way sp@@ oil him : he is a re@@ pro@@ ach to his neighbours .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also turned the edge of his s@@ word , and h@@ ast not made him to stand in the battle .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made his gl@@ ory to ce@@ ase , and cast his th@@ r@@ one down to the ground .
the days of his youth h@@ ast th@@ ou shor@@ tened : th@@ ou h@@ ast covered him with sh@@ ame . Se@@ lah .
what man is he that li@@ vet@@ h , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his sou@@ l from the hand of the grave ? Se@@ lah .
before the mountains were brought forth , or ever th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st formed the ear@@ th and the world , even from ever@@ lasting to ever@@ lasting , th@@ ou art God .
for a thousand years in TH@@ Y sight are but as yes@@ ter@@ day when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
T@@ ho@@ u carri@@ est them away as with a flood ; they are as a sle@@ ep : in the morning they are like gr@@ ass which grow@@ eth up .
in the morning it flo@@ ur@@ is@@ het@@ h , and grow@@ eth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and with@@ er@@ eth .
for we are consu@@ med by th@@ ine an@@ ger , and by TH@@ Y wr@@ ath are we troubled .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast set our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities before the@@ e , our secret sin@@ s in the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance .
for all our days are passed away in TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : we spend our years as a tal@@ e that is told .
the days of our years are thre@@ es@@ core years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fo@@ ur@@ score years , yet is their strength labour and sor@@ row ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
who know@@ eth the power of th@@ ine an@@ ger ? even according to TH@@ Y fear , so is TH@@ Y wr@@ ath .
O satisfy us early with TH@@ Y mer@@ cy ; that we may re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad all our days .
make us glad according to the days where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast aff@@ lic@@ ted us , and the years where@@ in we have seen ev@@ il .
let TH@@ Y work appear un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , and TH@@ Y gl@@ ory un@@ to their children .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish th@@ ou the work of our hands upon us ; ye@@ a , the work of our hands establish th@@ ou it .
he that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
su@@ rely he shall deliver the@@ e from the sn@@ are of the fo@@ w@@ ler , and from the no@@ is@@ ome p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
he shall cover the@@ e with his fe@@ ath@@ ers , and under his w@@ ings s@@ halt th@@ ou trust : his truth shall be TH@@ Y shield and bu@@ ck@@ ler .
a thousand shall fall at TH@@ Y side , and ten thousand at TH@@ Y right hand ; but it shall not come n@@ igh the@@ e .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast made the Lord , which is my ref@@ uge , even the most High , TH@@ Y habi@@ tation ;
there shall no ev@@ il be@@ fall the@@ e , neither shall any pla@@ gue come n@@ igh TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling .
they shall bear the@@ e up in their hands , lest th@@ ou d@@ ash TH@@ Y fo@@ ot against a stone .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt tre@@ ad upon the lion and ad@@ der : the young lion and the dra@@ g@@ on s@@ halt th@@ ou tr@@ amp@@ le under feet .
because he hat@@ h set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver him : I will set him on high , because he hat@@ h known my name .
he shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
for th@@ ou , Lord , h@@ ast made me glad through TH@@ Y work : I will triumph in the works of TH@@ Y hands .
when the w@@ ic@@ ked spring as the gr@@ ass , and when all the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity do flo@@ ur@@ ish ; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever :
for , lo , th@@ ine enem@@ ies , O Lord , for , lo , th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall per@@ ish ; all the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be sc@@ at@@ tered .
but my Hor@@ n s@@ halt th@@ ou ex@@ alt like the Hor@@ n of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n : I shall be ano@@ in@@ ted with fresh oil .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enem@@ ies , and mine e@@ ars shall hear my desire of the w@@ ic@@ ked that rise up against me .
the righ@@ te@@ ous shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like the pal@@ m tree : he shall grow like a c@@ ed@@ ar in Lebanon .
those that be plan@@ ted in the house of the Lord shall flo@@ ur@@ ish in the courts of our God .
the Lord re@@ ig@@ net@@ h , he is clo@@ th@@ ed with maj@@ es@@ ty ; the Lord is clo@@ th@@ ed with strength , where@@ with he hat@@ h gir@@ ded himself : the world also is st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed , that it can@@ not be moved .
the floods have lifted up , O Lord , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their waves .
the Lord on high is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than the no@@ ise of many waters , ye@@ a , than the m@@ igh@@ ty waves of the sea .
how long shall they ut@@ ter and speak hard things ? and all the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity bo@@ ast themselves ?
he that plan@@ ted the e@@ ar , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
he that ch@@ as@@ ti@@ set@@ h the he@@ a@@ then , shall not he correct ? he that teach@@ eth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
the Lord know@@ eth the th@@ ou@@ ghts of man , that they are van@@ ity .
that th@@ ou may@@ est give him rest from the days of ad@@ versity , until the p@@ it be dig@@ ged for the w@@ ic@@ ked .
for the Lord will not cast off his people , neither will he for@@ sake his inher@@ it@@ ance .
who will rise up for me against the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers ? or who will stand up for me against the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ?
shall the th@@ r@@ one of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity have fel@@ low@@ ship with the@@ e , which fra@@ me@@ th mis@@ chief by a law ?
they gather themselves together against the sou@@ l of the righ@@ te@@ ous , and condemn the innocent blood .
but the Lord is my defence ; and my God is the rock of my ref@@ uge .
and he shall bring upon them their own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and shall cut them off in their own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; ye@@ a , the Lord our God shall cut them off .
O come , let us sing un@@ to the Lord : let us make a jo@@ y@@ ful no@@ ise to the rock of our sal@@ vation .
let us come before his presence with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and make a jo@@ y@@ ful no@@ ise un@@ to him with p@@ sal@@ ms .
in his hand are the deep places of the ear@@ th : the strength of the hil@@ ls is his also .
O come , let us worship and bo@@ w down : let us k@@ ne@@ el before the Lord our maker .
for he is our God ; and we are the people of his pas@@ ture , and the she@@ ep of his hand . to day if ye will hear his voice ,
har@@ den not your heart , as in the provoc@@ ation , and as in the day of temp@@ tation in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness :
for@@ ty years long was I gri@@ ev@@ ed with this generation , and said , It is a people that do er@@ r in their heart , and they have not known my ways :
sing un@@ to the Lord , b@@ less his name ; she@@ w forth his sal@@ vation from day to day .
for the Lord is great , and greatly to be praised : he is to be fear@@ ed above all go@@ ds .
give un@@ to the Lord the gl@@ ory due un@@ to his name : bring an offering , and come into his courts .
say among the he@@ a@@ then that the Lord re@@ ig@@ net@@ h : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righ@@ te@@ ously .
let the heav@@ ens re@@ jo@@ ice , and let the ear@@ th be glad ; let the sea ro@@ ar , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of .
the hil@@ ls mel@@ ted like wa@@ x at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the Lord of the whole ear@@ th .
Con@@ founded be all they that serve Gra@@ ven images , that bo@@ ast themselves of id@@ ols : worship him , all ye go@@ ds .
Z@@ ion heard , and was glad ; and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed because of TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , O Lord .
Y@@ e that love the Lord , h@@ ate ev@@ il : he preser@@ vet@@ h the so@@ ul@@ s of his sa@@ ints ; he deliver@@ eth them out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
light is so@@ wn for the righ@@ te@@ ous , and gla@@ d@@ ness for the u@@ pri@@ ght in heart .
O sing un@@ to the Lord a new song ; for he hat@@ h done mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous things : his right hand , and his hol@@ y arm , hat@@ h gotten him the victory .
the Lord hat@@ h made known his sal@@ vation : his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness hat@@ h he openly she@@ wed in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then .
he hat@@ h remember@@ ed his mer@@ cy and his truth toward the house of Israel : all the ends of the ear@@ th have seen the sal@@ vation of our God .
make a jo@@ y@@ ful no@@ ise un@@ to the Lord , all the ear@@ th : make a l@@ oud no@@ ise , and re@@ jo@@ ice , and sing praise .
sing un@@ to the Lord with the har@@ p ; with the har@@ p , and the voice of a p@@ sal@@ m .
let the sea ro@@ ar , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of ; the world , and they that d@@ well there@@ in .
let the floods cla@@ p their hands : let the hil@@ ls be jo@@ y@@ ful together
Mos@@ es and Aaron among his pri@@ ests , and Samuel among them that call upon his name ; they called upon the Lord , and he answ@@ ered them .
he sp@@ ake un@@ to them in the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar : they kept his testimon@@ ies , and the ordin@@ ance that he gave them .
for the Lord is good ; his mer@@ cy is ever@@ lasting ; and his truth en@@ du@@ re@@ th to all generations .
I will be@@ have myself wis@@ ely in a perfect way . O when w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou come un@@ to me ? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
I will set no w@@ ic@@ ked thing before mine eyes : I h@@ ate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cle@@ ave to me .
a fro@@ ward heart shall de@@ part from me : I will not know a w@@ ic@@ ked person .
W@@ hos@@ o priv@@ ily s@@ lan@@ der@@ eth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hat@@ h an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
mine eyes shall be upon the fa@@ ith@@ ful of the land , that they may d@@ well with me : he that walk@@ eth in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
he that wor@@ ket@@ h dec@@ e@@ it shall not d@@ well within my house : he that tel@@ le@@ th lies shall not tar@@ ry in my sight .
I will early destroy all the w@@ ic@@ ked of the land ; that I may cut off all w@@ ic@@ ked do@@ ers from the city of the Lord .
hide not TH@@ Y face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar un@@ to me : in the day when I call answer me spe@@ edil@@ y .
my heart is s@@ mit@@ ten , and with@@ ered like gr@@ ass ; so that I forget to eat my bread .
by reason of the voice of my gro@@ an@@ ing my b@@ ones cle@@ ave to my s@@ kin .
I am like a p@@ el@@ ic@@ an of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : I am like an ow@@ l of the de@@ sert .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt arise , and have mer@@ cy upon Z@@ ion : for the time to favour her , ye@@ a , the set time , is come .
for TH@@ Y servants take pleas@@ ure in her stones , and favour the d@@ ust there@@ of .
so the he@@ a@@ then shall fear the name of the Lord , and all the kings of the ear@@ th TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
this shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord .
for he hat@@ h looked down from the he@@ ight of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; from heav@@ en did the Lord be@@ hold the ear@@ th ;
to hear the gro@@ an@@ ing of the prison@@ er ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
of old h@@ ast th@@ ou laid the foundation of the ear@@ th : and the heav@@ ens are the work of TH@@ Y hands .
they shall per@@ ish , but th@@ ou s@@ halt en@@ dur@@ e : ye@@ a , all of them shall wa@@ x old like a gar@@ ment ; as a ves@@ ture s@@ halt th@@ ou change them , and they shall be changed :
but th@@ ou art the same , and TH@@ Y years shall have no end .
he made known his ways un@@ to Mos@@ es , his acts un@@ to the children of Israel .
he will not always chi@@ de : neither will he keep his an@@ ger for ever .
he hat@@ h not dealt with us after our sin@@ s ; nor re@@ warded us according to our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
as far as the east is from the west , so far hat@@ h he removed our trans@@ gres@@ sions from us .
as for man , his days are as gr@@ ass : as a f@@ lower of the field , so he flo@@ ur@@ is@@ het@@ h .
for the wind pass@@ eth over it , and it is gone ; and the place there@@ of shall know it no more .
but the mer@@ cy of the Lord is from ever@@ lasting to ever@@ lasting upon them that fear him , and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to children 's children ;
the Lord hat@@ h prepared his th@@ r@@ one in the heav@@ ens ; and his k@@ ing@@ dom ru@@ le@@ th over all .
b@@ less the Lord , ye his an@@ gel@@ s , that exc@@ el in strength , that do his comman@@ d@@ ments , hear@@ ken@@ ing un@@ to the voice of his word .
b@@ less the Lord , O my sou@@ l . O Lord my God , th@@ ou art very great ; th@@ ou art clo@@ th@@ ed with honour and maj@@ es@@ ty .
who cover@@ est th@@ y@@ self with light as with a gar@@ ment : who stret@@ ch@@ est out the heav@@ ens like a cur@@ tain :
who lay@@ eth the be@@ ams of his ch@@ ambers in the waters : who mak@@ eth the cl@@ ou@@ ds his char@@ i@@ ot : who walk@@ eth upon the w@@ ings of the wind :
who mak@@ eth his an@@ gel@@ s spir@@ its ; his ministers a f@@ laming fire :
who laid the foundations of the ear@@ th , that it should not be removed for ever .
at TH@@ Y re@@ bu@@ ke they fled ; at the voice of TH@@ Y Th@@ under they has@@ ted away .
they go up by the mountains ; they go down by the val@@ ley@@ s un@@ to the place which th@@ ou h@@ ast founded for them .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the ear@@ th .
he sen@@ de@@ th the spr@@ ings into the val@@ ley@@ s , which run among the hil@@ ls .
they give drink to every be@@ ast of the field : the wild ass@@ es qu@@ en@@ ch their thir@@ st .
by them shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en have their habi@@ tation , which sing among the branches .
he water@@ eth the hil@@ ls from his ch@@ ambers : the ear@@ th is satisfied with the fruit of TH@@ Y works .
he ca@@ us@@ eth the gr@@ ass to grow for the c@@ attle , and her@@ b for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the ear@@ th ;
and wine that mak@@ eth glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to sh@@ ine , and bread which strength@@ en@@ eth man 's heart .
the trees of the Lord are full of S@@ AP ; the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon , which he hat@@ h plan@@ ted ;
where the birds make their nes@@ ts : as for the stor@@ k , the f@@ ir trees are her house .
the high hil@@ ls are a ref@@ uge for the wild go@@ ats ; and the ro@@ cks for the con@@ ies .
T@@ ho@@ u mak@@ est d@@ ark@@ ness , and it is night : where@@ in all the be@@ asts of the forest do cre@@ ep forth .
the sun ar@@ is@@ eth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their den@@ s .
O Lord , how manif@@ old are TH@@ Y works ! in wis@@ dom h@@ ast th@@ ou made them all : the ear@@ th is full of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches .
so is this great and wide sea , where@@ in are things cre@@ eping in@@ num@@ er@@ able , both small and great be@@ asts .
there go the ships : there is that le@@ vi@@ athan , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast made to play there@@ in .
these wait all upon the@@ e ; that th@@ ou may@@ est give them their meat in due season .
that th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est them they gather : th@@ ou open@@ est th@@ ine hand , they are filled with good .
T@@ ho@@ u hi@@ dest TH@@ Y face , they are troubled : th@@ ou tak@@ est away their bre@@ ath , they die , and return to their d@@ ust .
T@@ ho@@ u sen@@ dest forth TH@@ Y spirit , they are created : and th@@ ou rene@@ west the face of the ear@@ th .
the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall en@@ dur@@ e for ever : the Lord shall re@@ jo@@ ice in his works .
he lo@@ ok@@ eth on the ear@@ th , and it tre@@ m@@ ble@@ th : he tou@@ ch@@ eth the hil@@ ls , and they smoke .
I will sing un@@ to the Lord as long as I live : I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
let the sin@@ ners be consu@@ med out of the ear@@ th , and let the w@@ ic@@ ked be no more . b@@ less th@@ ou the Lord , O my sou@@ l . praise ye the Lord .
O give thanks un@@ to the Lord ; call upon his name : make known his de@@ eds among the people .
sing un@@ to him , sing p@@ sal@@ ms un@@ to him : talk ye of all his won@@ dro@@ us works .
gl@@ ory ye in his hol@@ y name : let the heart of them re@@ jo@@ ice that seek the Lord .
and confirmed the same un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b for a law , and to Israel for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
when they were but a few men in number ; ye@@ a , very few , and st@@ ran@@ gers in it .
when they went from one nation to another , from one k@@ ing@@ dom to another people ;
moreover he called for a fam@@ ine upon the land : he br@@ ake the whole staff of bread .
he sent a man before them , even Joseph , who was sold for a ser@@ vant :
until the time that his word came : the word of the Lord tried him .
the king sent and lo@@ os@@ ed him ; even the ru@@ ler of the people , and let him go free .
their land brought forth fro@@ gs in ab@@ und@@ ance , in the ch@@ ambers of their kings .
he sp@@ ake , and there came di@@ vers sor@@ ts of f@@ lies , and lice in all their co@@ asts .
he smo@@ te their v@@ ines also and their fi@@ g trees ; and br@@ ake the trees of their co@@ asts .
he sp@@ ake , and the loc@@ ust@@ s came , and cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lers , and that without number ,
and did eat up all the her@@ bs in their land , and dev@@ oured the fruit of their ground .
he smo@@ te also all the fir@@ st@@ born in their land , the chief of all their strength .
he brought them forth also with silver and gold : and there was not one fe@@ e@@ ble person among their tri@@ bes .
the people asked , and he brought qu@@ ails , and satisfied them with the bread of heav@@ en .
he opened the rock , and the waters gus@@ hed out ; they ran in the d@@ ry places like a river .
and gave them the lands of the he@@ a@@ then : and they inherited the labour of the people ;
praise ye the Lord . O give thanks un@@ to the Lord ; for he is good : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
remember me , O Lord , with the favour that th@@ ou be@@ ar@@ est un@@ to TH@@ Y people : O visit me with TH@@ Y sal@@ vation ;
that I may see the good of TH@@ Y chosen , that I may re@@ jo@@ ice in the gla@@ d@@ ness of TH@@ Y nation , that I may gl@@ ory with th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance .
our fa@@ thers understood not TH@@ Y won@@ ders in Egypt ; they remember@@ ed not the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the Red sea .
nevertheless he sav@@ ed them for his name 's sake , that he might make his m@@ igh@@ ty power to be known .
he re@@ bu@@ ked the Red sea also , and it was dri@@ ed up : so he led them through the dep@@ ths , as through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and he sav@@ ed them from the hand of him that ha@@ ted them , and re@@ deemed them from the hand of the enemy .
and the waters covered their enem@@ ies : there was not one of them left .
they en@@ vi@@ ed Mos@@ es also in the camp , and Aaron the sa@@ int of the Lord .
and a fire was kin@@ d@@ led in their company ; the fla@@ me burned up the w@@ ic@@ ked .
thus they changed their gl@@ ory into the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of an o@@ x that e@@ ate@@ th gr@@ ass .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Mos@@ es his chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wr@@ ath , lest he should destroy them .
but mur@@ mu@@ red in their ten@@ ts , and hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the voice of the Lord .
therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness :
thus they provoked him to an@@ ger with their in@@ ven@@ tions : and the pla@@ gue br@@ ake in upon them .
then stood up Ph@@ ine@@ has , and executed judgment : and so the pla@@ gue was stayed .
they an@@ gered him also at the waters of stri@@ fe , so that it went ill with Mos@@ es for their sak@@ es :
because they provoked his spirit , so that he sp@@ ake un@@ advis@@ edly with his li@@ ps .
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to the id@@ ols of Can@@ a@@ an : and the land was pollu@@ ted with blood .
thus were they def@@ iled with their own works , and went a wh@@ oring with their own in@@ ven@@ tions .
therefore was the wr@@ ath of the Lord kin@@ d@@ led against his people , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that he ab@@ hor@@ red his own inher@@ it@@ ance .
and he gave them into the hand of the he@@ a@@ then ; and they that ha@@ ted them ruled over them .
their enem@@ ies also op@@ pressed them , and they were brought into subj@@ ection under their hand .
many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their coun@@ sel , and were brought low for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and he remember@@ ed for them his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and re@@ pen@@ ted according to the multi@@ tude of his mer@@ cies .
he made them also to be p@@ iti@@ ed of all those that carried them cap@@ tives .
save us , O Lord our God , and gather us from among the he@@ a@@ then , to give thanks un@@ to TH@@ Y hol@@ y name , and to triumph in TH@@ Y praise .
let the re@@ deemed of the Lord say so , whom he hat@@ h re@@ deemed from the hand of the enemy ;
and gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
they w@@ and@@ ered in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in a sol@@ itary way ; they found no city to d@@ well in .
then they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their dist@@ resses .
and he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habi@@ tation .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
such as sit in d@@ ark@@ ness and in the shadow of death , being bound in aff@@ li@@ ction and iron ;
because they rebel@@ led against the words of God , and con@@ tem@@ ned the coun@@ sel of the most High :
therefore he brought down their heart with labour ; they fell down , and there was none to help .
then they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord in their trouble , and he sav@@ ed them out of their dist@@ resses .
he brought them out of d@@ ark@@ ness and the shadow of death , and br@@ ake their bands in s@@ under .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
for he hat@@ h broken the gates of br@@ ass , and cut the bars of iron in s@@ under .
fo@@ ols because of their trans@@ gres@@ sion , and because of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , are aff@@ lic@@ ted .
their sou@@ l ab@@ hor@@ re@@ th all manner of meat ; and they draw near un@@ to the gates of death .
then they cry un@@ to the Lord in their trouble , and he sav@@ eth them out of their dist@@ resses .
he sent his word , and he@@ aled them , and delivered them from their de@@ struc@@ tions .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
and let them sacrifice the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and declare his works with re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
they that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ;
these see the works of the Lord , and his won@@ ders in the deep .
they mount up to the heav@@ en , they go down again to the dep@@ ths : their sou@@ l is mel@@ ted because of trouble .
they reel to and f@@ ro , and stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and are at their wit@@ s ' end .
then they cry un@@ to the Lord in their trouble , and he br@@ ing@@ eth them out of their dist@@ resses .
he mak@@ eth the storm a calm , so that the waves there@@ of are still .
then are they glad because they be quiet ; so he br@@ ing@@ eth them un@@ to their desi@@ red ha@@ ven .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
let them ex@@ alt him also in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the el@@ ders .
he tur@@ net@@ h rivers into a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the water@@ spr@@ ings into d@@ ry ground ;
and there he mak@@ eth the hun@@ gry to d@@ well , that they may prepare a city for habi@@ tation ;
he b@@ les@@ set@@ h them also , so that they are multi@@ p@@ lied greatly ; and suffer@@ eth not their c@@ attle to decrease .
he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th con@@ temp@@ t upon pr@@ inces , and ca@@ us@@ eth them to w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where there is no way .
yet set@@ te@@ th he the poor on high from aff@@ li@@ ction , and mak@@ eth him families like a flock .
the righ@@ te@@ ous shall see it , and re@@ jo@@ ice : and all in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall stop her m@@ outh .
W@@ hos@@ o is wise , and will observe these things , even they shall understand the lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness of the Lord .
I will praise the@@ e , O Lord , among the people : and I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to the@@ e among the nations .
for TH@@ Y mer@@ cy is great above the heav@@ ens : and TH@@ Y truth reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
be th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted , O God , above the heav@@ ens : and TH@@ Y gl@@ ory above all the ear@@ th ;
God hat@@ h spoken in his hol@@ iness ; I will re@@ jo@@ ice , I will divide Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and M@@ ete out the val@@ ley of Suc@@ co@@ th .
G@@ il@@ e@@ ad is mine ; Man@@ as@@ se@@ h is mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im also is the strength of mine head ; Ju@@ da@@ h is my law@@ gi@@ ver ;
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , who h@@ ast cast us off ? and w@@ il@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
through God we shall do val@@ i@@ antly : for he it is that shall tre@@ ad down our enem@@ ies .
for the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked and the m@@ outh of the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying ton@@ gue .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about also with words of hatred ; and fought against me without a cause .
and they have re@@ warded me ev@@ il for good , and hatred for my love .
when he shall be jud@@ ged , let him be condemned : and let his pray@@ er become sin .
let his children be continu@@ ally v@@ ag@@ abon@@ ds , and be@@ g : let them seek their bread also out of their de@@ so@@ late places .
let the ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ er catch all that he hat@@ h ; and let the st@@ ran@@ gers sp@@ oil his labour .
let there be none to extend mer@@ cy un@@ to him : neither let there be any to favour his fa@@ ther@@ less children .
let his poster@@ ity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blo@@ t@@ ted out .
let the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his fa@@ thers be remember@@ ed with the Lord ; and let not the sin of his mother be blo@@ t@@ ted out .
let them be before the Lord continu@@ ally , that he may cut off the memory of them from the ear@@ th .
because that he remember@@ ed not to she@@ w mer@@ cy , but persec@@ uted the poor and ne@@ edy man , that he might even s@@ lay the broken in heart .
as he lov@@ ed cur@@ sing , so let it come un@@ to him : as he deli@@ gh@@ ted not in b@@ les@@ sing , so let it be far from him .
as he clo@@ th@@ ed himself with cur@@ sing like as with his gar@@ ment , so let it come into his bo@@ wel@@ s like water , and like oil into his b@@ ones .
let it be un@@ to him as the gar@@ ment which cover@@ eth him , and for a gir@@ dle where@@ with he is gir@@ ded continu@@ ally .
let this be the reward of mine ad@@ vers@@ aries from the Lord , and of them that speak ev@@ il against my sou@@ l .
but do th@@ ou for me , O God the Lord , for TH@@ Y name 's sake : because TH@@ Y mer@@ cy is good , deliver th@@ ou me .
for I am poor and ne@@ edy , and my heart is wounded within me .
I am gone like the shadow when it dec@@ lin@@ eth : I am tos@@ sed up and down as the loc@@ ust .
I became also a re@@ pro@@ ach un@@ to them : when they looked upon me they shak@@ ed their heads .
let them cur@@ se , but b@@ less th@@ ou : when they arise , let them be as@@ ha@@ med ; but let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant re@@ jo@@ ice .
let mine ad@@ vers@@ aries be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame , and let them cover themselves with their own conf@@ usion , as with a man@@ tle .
I will greatly praise the Lord with my m@@ outh ; ye@@ a , I will praise him among the multi@@ tude .
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor , to save him from those that condemn his sou@@ l .
the Lord shall send the ro@@ d of TH@@ Y strength out of Z@@ ion : rule th@@ ou in the mid@@ st of th@@ ine enem@@ ies .
TH@@ Y people shall be willing in the day of TH@@ Y power , in the be@@ au@@ ties of hol@@ iness from the w@@ om@@ b of the morning : th@@ ou h@@ ast the dew of TH@@ Y youth .
he shall judge among the he@@ a@@ then , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wo@@ und the heads over many countries .
praise ye the Lord . I will praise the Lord with my whole heart , in the assembly of the u@@ pri@@ ght , and in the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
the works of the Lord are great , sought out of all them that have pleas@@ ure there@@ in .
he hat@@ h made his won@@ der@@ ful works to be remember@@ ed : the Lord is gr@@ ac@@ ious and full of comp@@ as@@ sion .
he hat@@ h given meat un@@ to them that fear him : he will ever be min@@ d@@ ful of his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
he hat@@ h she@@ wed his people the power of his works , that he may give them the heritage of the he@@ a@@ then .
they stand fast for ever and ever , and are done in truth and u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
he sent re@@ dem@@ ption un@@ to his people : he hat@@ h comman@@ ded his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant for ever : Holy and rever@@ end is his name .
his se@@ ed shall be m@@ igh@@ ty upon ear@@ th : the generation of the u@@ pri@@ ght shall be b@@ les@@ sed .
un@@ to the u@@ pri@@ ght there ar@@ is@@ eth light in the d@@ ark@@ ness : he is gr@@ ac@@ ious , and full of comp@@ as@@ sion , and righ@@ te@@ ous .
su@@ rely he shall not be moved for ever : the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be in ever@@ lasting re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance .
he shall not be afraid of ev@@ il ti@@ dings : his heart is fixed , tru@@ sting in the Lord .
his heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enem@@ ies .
he hat@@ h disper@@ sed , he hat@@ h given to the poor ; his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever ; his Hor@@ n shall be ex@@ al@@ ted with honour .
the w@@ ic@@ ked shall see it , and be gri@@ ev@@ ed ; he shall gn@@ ash with his te@@ eth , and mel@@ t away : the desire of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall per@@ ish .
b@@ les@@ sed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for ever@@ more .
from the rising of the sun un@@ to the going down of the same the Lord 's name is to be praised .
the Lord is high above all nations , and his gl@@ ory above the heav@@ ens .
who hum@@ ble@@ th himself to be@@ hold the things that are in heav@@ en , and in the ear@@ th !
he ra@@ is@@ eth up the poor out of the d@@ ust , and lif@@ te@@ th the ne@@ edy out of the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill ;
that he may set him with pr@@ inces , even with the pr@@ inces of his people .
not un@@ to us , O Lord , not un@@ to us , but un@@ to TH@@ Y name give gl@@ ory , for TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , and for TH@@ Y truth 's sake .
but our God is in the heav@@ ens : he hat@@ h done wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he hat@@ h pleased .
they have m@@ ou@@ ths , but they speak not : eyes have they , but they see not :
they have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their thro@@ at .
they that make them are like un@@ to them ; so is every one that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in them .
Y@@ e that fear the Lord , trust in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
the Lord hat@@ h been min@@ d@@ ful of us : he will b@@ less us ; he will b@@ less the house of Israel ; he will b@@ less the house of Aaron .
the Lord shall increase you more and more , you and your children .
the heav@@ en , even the heav@@ ens , are the Lord 's : but the ear@@ th hat@@ h he given to the children of men .
I love the Lord , because he hat@@ h heard my voice and my supp@@ lic@@ ations .
because he hat@@ h inc@@ lined his e@@ ar un@@ to me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of death comp@@ ass@@ ed me , and the pain@@ s of hell g@@ at hold upon me : I found trouble and sor@@ row .
G@@ rac@@ ious is the Lord , and righ@@ te@@ ous ; ye@@ a , our God is mer@@ ci@@ ful .
the Lord preser@@ vet@@ h the simple : I was brought low , and he helped me .
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living .
I will take the c@@ up of sal@@ vation , and call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows un@@ to the Lord now in the presence of all his people .
pre@@ ci@@ ous in the sight of the Lord is the death of his sa@@ ints .
O Lord , truly I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and the son of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id : th@@ ou h@@ ast lo@@ os@@ ed my bonds .
I will offer to the@@ e the sacrifice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and will call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows un@@ to the Lord now in the presence of all his people ,
I called upon the Lord in dist@@ ress : the Lord answ@@ ered me , and set me in a large place .
the Lord is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do un@@ to me ?
the Lord tak@@ eth my part with them that help me : therefore shall I see my desire upon them that h@@ ate me .
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man .
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in pr@@ inces .
all nations comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about ; ye@@ a , they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about like be@@ es ; they are qu@@ en@@ ched as the fire of thor@@ ns : for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
the voice of re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing and sal@@ vation is in the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of the righ@@ te@@ ous : the right hand of the Lord do@@ eth val@@ i@@ antly .
I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the Lord .
the Lord hat@@ h ch@@ as@@ tened me sor@@ e : but he hat@@ h not given me over un@@ to death .
open to me the gates of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : I will go into them , and I will praise the Lord :
I will praise the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast heard me , and art become my sal@@ vation .
the stone which the buil@@ ders refused is become the head stone of the cor@@ ner .
this is the day which the Lord hat@@ h made ; we will re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad in it .
b@@ les@@ sed be he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord : we have b@@ les@@ sed you out of the house of the Lord .
T@@ ho@@ u art my God , and I will praise the@@ e : th@@ ou art my God , I will ex@@ alt the@@ e .
then shall I not be as@@ ha@@ med , when I have respect un@@ to all TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments .
I will praise the@@ e with u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of heart , when I shall have learned TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous judg@@ ments .
W@@ her@@ e@@ with@@ al shall a young man cleans@@ e his way ? by taking heed there@@ to according to TH@@ Y word .
with my whole heart have I sought the@@ e : O let me not w@@ ander from TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments .
TH@@ Y word have I hi@@ d in mine heart , that I might not sin against the@@ e .
I have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in the way of TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , as much as in all ri@@ ches .
I will medi@@ t@@ ate in TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts , and have respect un@@ to TH@@ Y ways .
I will de@@ light myself in TH@@ Y stat@@ utes : I will not forget TH@@ Y word .
deal boun@@ ti@@ fully with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , that I may live , and keep TH@@ Y word .
open th@@ ou mine eyes , that I may be@@ hold won@@ dro@@ us things out of TH@@ Y law .
I am a st@@ ran@@ ger in the ear@@ th : hide not TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments from me .

T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast re@@ bu@@ ked the proud that are Cur@@ sed , which do er@@ r from TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments .

I have chosen the way of truth : TH@@ Y judg@@ ments have I laid before me .
I will run the way of TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , when th@@ ou s@@ halt en@@ large my heart .
give me understanding , and I shall keep TH@@ Y law ; ye@@ a , I shall observe it with my whole heart .
turn away mine eyes from be@@ holding van@@ ity ; and quic@@ ken th@@ ou me in TH@@ Y way .
let TH@@ Y mer@@ cies come also un@@ to me , O Lord , even TH@@ Y sal@@ vation , according to TH@@ Y word .
so shall I have where@@ with to answer him that re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth me : for I trust in TH@@ Y word .
and take not the word of truth ut@@ ter@@ ly out of my m@@ outh ; for I have hoped in TH@@ Y judg@@ ments .
and I will de@@ light myself in TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , which I have lov@@ ed .
my hands also will I lift up un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , which I have lov@@ ed ; and I will medi@@ t@@ ate in TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
remember the word un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , upon which th@@ ou h@@ ast caused me to hope .
the proud have had me greatly in der@@ ision : yet have I not declined from TH@@ Y law .
I have remember@@ ed TH@@ Y name , O Lord , in the night , and have kept TH@@ Y law .
I in@@ treated TH@@ Y favour with my whole heart : be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me according to TH@@ Y word .
the bands of the w@@ ic@@ ked have ro@@ bbed me : but I have not forgotten TH@@ Y law .
at midnight I will rise to give thanks un@@ to the@@ e because of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous judg@@ ments .
I am a compan@@ ion of all them that fear the@@ e , and of them that keep TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
the ear@@ th , O Lord , is full of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : te@@ ach me TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
the proud have forged a lie against me : but I will keep TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts with my whole heart .
it is good for me that I have been aff@@ lic@@ ted ; that I might learn TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
TH@@ Y hands have made me and fas@@ hi@@ oned me : give me understanding , that I may learn TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments .
they that fear the@@ e will be glad when they see me ; because I have hoped in TH@@ Y word .
I know , O Lord , that TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are right , and that th@@ ou in fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness h@@ ast aff@@ lic@@ ted me .
let , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y mer@@ ci@@ ful kin@@ d@@ ness be for my comfor@@ t , according to TH@@ Y word un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
let TH@@ Y tender mer@@ cies come un@@ to me , that I may live : for TH@@ Y law is my de@@ light .
let the proud be as@@ ha@@ med ; for they dealt per@@ ver@@ sely with me without a cause : but I will medi@@ t@@ ate in TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
let those that fear the@@ e turn un@@ to me , and those that have known TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies .
for I am become like a bot@@ tle in the smoke ; yet do I not forget TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
how many are the days of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ? when w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou exec@@ ute judgment on them that persec@@ ute me ?
Qu@@ ic@@ ken me after TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness ; so shall I keep the testimony of TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness is un@@ to all generations : th@@ ou h@@ ast established the ear@@ th , and it abi@@ de@@ th .
unless TH@@ Y law had been my deli@@ ghts , I should then have per@@ ished in mine aff@@ li@@ ction .
the w@@ ic@@ ked have w@@ aited for me to destroy me : but I will consider TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies .
T@@ ho@@ u through TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments h@@ ast made me wis@@ er than mine enem@@ ies : for they are ever with me .
I have more understanding than all my teachers : for TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies are my medi@@ tation .
I have ref@@ ra@@ ined my feet from every ev@@ il way , that I might keep TH@@ Y word .
I have not depar@@ ted from TH@@ Y judg@@ ments : for th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught me .
TH@@ Y word is a lam@@ p un@@ to my feet , and a light un@@ to my path .
I have sworn , and I will perform it , that I will keep TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous judg@@ ments .

my sou@@ l is continu@@ ally in my hand : yet do I not forget TH@@ Y law .
the w@@ ic@@ ked have laid a sn@@ are for me : yet I er@@ red not from TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies have I taken as an heritage for ever : for they are the re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing of my heart .
I have inc@@ lined mine heart to perform TH@@ Y stat@@ utes al@@ way , even un@@ to the end .
up@@ hold me according un@@ to TH@@ Y word , that I may live : and let me not be as@@ ha@@ med of my hope .

T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast tro@@ dden down all them that er@@ r from TH@@ Y stat@@ utes : for their dec@@ e@@ it is fal@@ se@@ hood .

deal with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant according un@@ to TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , and te@@ ach me TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
it is time for the@@ e , Lord , to work : for they have made vo@@ id TH@@ Y law .
therefore I es@@ te@@ em all TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts concerning all things to be right ; and I h@@ ate every false way .
look th@@ ou upon me , and be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , as th@@ ou us@@ est to do un@@ to those that love TH@@ Y name .
deliver me from the op@@ pression of man : so will I keep TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is an ever@@ lasting righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and TH@@ Y law is the truth .
trouble and an@@ gu@@ ish have taken hold on me : yet TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments are my deli@@ ghts .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e ; save me , and I shall keep TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies .
I prevented the da@@ w@@ ning of the morning , and cri@@ ed : I hoped in TH@@ Y word .
they draw n@@ igh that follow after mis@@ chief : they are far from TH@@ Y law .
concerning TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , I have known of old that th@@ ou h@@ ast founded them for ever .
I be@@ held the trans@@ gres@@ sors , and was gri@@ ev@@ ed ; because they kept not TH@@ Y word .
TH@@ Y word is true from the beginning : and every one of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous judg@@ ments en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
pr@@ inces have persec@@ uted me without a cause : but my heart stan@@ de@@ th in a@@ we of TH@@ Y word .
I have kept TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts and TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies : for all my ways are before the@@ e .
let my cry come near before the@@ e , O Lord : give me understanding according to TH@@ Y word .
I have lon@@ ged for TH@@ Y sal@@ vation , O Lord ; and TH@@ Y law is my de@@ light .
I have gone as@@ tra@@ y like a lost she@@ ep ; seek TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for I do not forget TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments .
in my dist@@ ress I cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and he heard me .
what shall be given un@@ to the@@ e ? or what shall be done un@@ to the@@ e , th@@ ou false ton@@ gue ?
I will lift up mine eyes un@@ to the hil@@ ls , from wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ th my help .
my help co@@ me@@ th from the Lord , which made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
he will not suffer TH@@ Y fo@@ ot to be moved : he that keep@@ eth the@@ e will not s@@ lum@@ ber .
the sun shall not sm@@ ite the@@ e by day , nor the moon by night .
the Lord shall preserve TH@@ Y going out and TH@@ Y coming in from this time forth , and even for ever@@ more .
W@@ hi@@ ther the tri@@ bes go up , the tri@@ bes of the Lord , un@@ to the testimony of Israel , to give thanks un@@ to the name of the Lord .
for there are set th@@ ron@@ es of judgment , the th@@ ron@@ es of the house of David .
un@@ to the@@ e lift I up mine eyes , O th@@ ou that d@@ wel@@ lest in the heav@@ ens .
our sou@@ l is exce@@ ed@@ ingly filled with the scor@@ ning of those that are at ease , and with the con@@ temp@@ t of the proud .
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side , now may Israel say ;
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side , when men rose up against us :
then they had sw@@ allowed us up quick , when their wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led against us :
then the waters had overwhel@@ med us , the stream had gone over our sou@@ l :
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , who hat@@ h not given us as a pre@@ y to their te@@ eth .
our sou@@ l is escaped as a bird out of the sn@@ are of the fo@@ w@@ lers : the sn@@ are is broken , and we are escaped .
our help is in the name of the Lord , who made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Z@@ ion , which can@@ not be removed , but abi@@ de@@ th for ever .
as the mountains are round about Jer@@ usalem , so the Lord is round about his people from hen@@ ce@@ forth even for ever .
for the ro@@ d of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not rest upon the lot of the righ@@ te@@ ous ; lest the righ@@ te@@ ous put forth their hands un@@ to in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
do good , O Lord , un@@ to those that be good , and to them that are u@@ pri@@ ght in their hear@@ ts .
as for such as turn aside un@@ to their cro@@ oked ways , the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
then was our m@@ outh filled with la@@ ughter , and our ton@@ gue with singing : then said they among the he@@ a@@ then , The Lord hat@@ h done great things for them .
he that go@@ eth forth and we@@ ep@@ eth , bearing pre@@ ci@@ ous se@@ ed , shall doub@@ t@@ less come again with re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , bringing his s@@ heav@@ es with him .
except the Lord build the house , they labour in v@@ ain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watch@@ man w@@ ak@@ eth but in v@@ ain .
it is v@@ ain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sor@@ ro@@ ws : for so he gi@@ vet@@ h his bel@@ ov@@ ed sle@@ ep .
L@@ o , children are an heritage of the Lord : and the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b is his reward .
as ar@@ ro@@ ws are in the hand of a m@@ igh@@ ty man ; so are children of the youth .
happy is the man that hat@@ h his qu@@ i@@ ver full of them : they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med , but they shall speak with the enem@@ ies in the gate .
b@@ les@@ sed is every one that fear@@ eth the Lord ; that walk@@ eth in his ways .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the labour of th@@ ine hands : happy s@@ halt th@@ ou be , and it shall be well with the@@ e .
TH@@ Y wife shall be as a fruit@@ ful v@@ ine by the sides of th@@ ine house : TH@@ Y children like olive plants round about TH@@ Y table .
the Lord shall b@@ less the@@ e out of Z@@ ion : and th@@ ou s@@ halt see the good of Jer@@ usalem all the days of TH@@ Y life .
many a time have they aff@@ lic@@ ted me from my youth : yet they have not prev@@ ailed against me .
the Lord is righ@@ te@@ ous : he hat@@ h cut as@@ under the cor@@ ds of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
let them be as the gr@@ ass upon the hous@@ et@@ ops , which with@@ er@@ eth a@@ fore it grow@@ eth up :
W@@ her@@ e@@ with the mo@@ wer fil@@ le@@ th not his hand ; nor he that bin@@ de@@ th s@@ heav@@ es his bos@@ om .
neither do they which go by say , The b@@ les@@ sing of the Lord be upon you : we b@@ less you in the name of the Lord .
out of the dep@@ ths have I cri@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord .
Lord , hear my voice : let th@@ ine e@@ ars be atten@@ tive to the voice of my supp@@ lic@@ ations .
I wait for the Lord , my sou@@ l do@@ th wait , and in his word do I hope .
my sou@@ l w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
let Israel hope in the Lord : for with the Lord there is mer@@ cy , and with him is plen@@ te@@ ous re@@ dem@@ ption .
Lord , my heart is not ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , nor mine eyes lo@@ f@@ ty : neither do I exercise myself in great matters , or in things too high for me .
su@@ rely I have beha@@ ved and qu@@ i@@ eted myself , as a child that is we@@ an@@ ed of his mother : my sou@@ l is even as a we@@ an@@ ed child .
Lord , remember David , and all his aff@@ lic@@ tions :
su@@ rely I will not come into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
I will not give sle@@ ep to mine eyes , or s@@ lum@@ ber to mine ey@@ eli@@ ds ,
L@@ o , we heard of it at E@@ ph@@ r@@ at@@ ah : we found it in the fields of the wood .
the Lord hat@@ h sworn in truth un@@ to David ; he will not turn from it ; O@@ f the fruit of TH@@ Y body will I set upon TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one .
if TH@@ Y children will keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my testimony that I shall te@@ ach them , their children shall also sit upon TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one for ever@@ more .
I will ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly b@@ less her provision : I will satisfy her poor with bread .
I will also clo@@ the her pri@@ ests with sal@@ vation : and her sa@@ ints shall sh@@ out al@@ oud for joy .
be@@ hold , how good and how pleas@@ ant it is for bre@@ th@@ ren to d@@ well together in unity !
it is like the pre@@ ci@@ ous o@@ in@@ tment upon the head , that ran down upon the be@@ ard , even Aaron 's be@@ ard : that went down to the sk@@ ir@@ ts of his gar@@ ments ;
as the dew of Her@@ mon , and as the dew that des@@ cen@@ ded upon the mountains of Z@@ ion : for there the Lord comman@@ ded the b@@ les@@ sing , even life for ever@@ more .
be@@ hold , b@@ less ye the Lord , all ye servants of the Lord , which by night stand in the house of the Lord .
for I know that the Lord is great , and that our Lord is above all go@@ ds .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the Lord pleased , that did he in heav@@ en , and in ear@@ th , in the seas , and all deep places .
he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings for the rain ; he br@@ ing@@ eth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
who sent to@@ ken@@ s and won@@ ders into the mid@@ st of the@@ e , O Egypt , upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his servants .
S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of Can@@ a@@ an :
TH@@ Y name , O Lord , en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever ; and TH@@ Y memorial , O Lord , throughout all generations .
for the Lord will judge his people , and he will rep@@ ent himself concerning his servants .
they have m@@ ou@@ ths , but they speak not ; eyes have they , but they see not ;
they have e@@ ars , but they hear not ; neither is there any bre@@ ath in their m@@ ou@@ ths .
they that make them are like un@@ to them : so is every one that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in them .
O give thanks un@@ to the God of go@@ ds : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
to him that by wis@@ dom made the heav@@ ens : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
to him that stret@@ ched out the ear@@ th above the waters : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
to him that made great lights : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever :

to him which divided the Red sea into parts : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever :
and made Israel to pass through the mid@@ st of it : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever :
but over@@ threw P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and his host in the Red sea : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
to him which led his people through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
to him which smo@@ te great kings : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever :
and hat@@ h re@@ deemed us from our enem@@ ies : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever .
by the rivers of Bab@@ yl@@ on , there we sat down , ye@@ a , we we@@ pt , when we remember@@ ed Z@@ ion .
we han@@ ged our har@@ ps upon the w@@ il@@ lows in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
for there they that carried us away cap@@ tive required of us a song ; and they that was@@ ted us required of us mir@@ th , saying , sing us one of the songs of Z@@ ion .
if I forget the@@ e , O Jer@@ usalem , let my right hand forget her c@@ un@@ ning .
if I do not remember the@@ e , let my ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of my m@@ outh ; if I prefer not Jer@@ usalem above my chief joy .
remember , O Lord , the children of E@@ dom in the day of Jer@@ usalem ; who said , R@@ ase it , r@@ ase it , even to the foundation there@@ of .
O daughter of Bab@@ yl@@ on , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that re@@ war@@ de@@ th the@@ e as th@@ ou h@@ ast served us .
happy shall he be , that tak@@ eth and d@@ ash@@ eth TH@@ Y little ones against the stones .
I will worship toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le , and praise TH@@ Y name for TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and for TH@@ Y truth : for th@@ ou h@@ ast mag@@ ni@@ fied TH@@ Y word above all TH@@ Y name .
Ye@@ a , they shall sing in the ways of the Lord : for great is the gl@@ ory of the Lord .
though the Lord be high , yet hat@@ h he respect un@@ to the low@@ ly : but the proud he know@@ eth af@@ ar off .
though I walk in the mid@@ st of trouble , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t revive me : th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth th@@ ine hand against the wr@@ ath of mine enem@@ ies , and TH@@ Y right hand shall save me .
the Lord will perfect that which concer@@ net@@ h me : TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , O Lord , en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever : for@@ sake not the works of th@@ ine own hands .
for there is not a word in my ton@@ gue , but , lo , O Lord , th@@ ou know@@ est it altogether .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bes@@ et me behind and before , and laid th@@ ine hand upon me .
such knowledge is too won@@ der@@ ful for me ; it is high , I can@@ not at@@ tain un@@ to it .
W@@ hi@@ ther shall I go from TH@@ Y spirit ? or w@@ hi@@ ther shall I flee from TH@@ Y presence ?
if I as@@ cen@@ d up into heav@@ en , th@@ ou art there : if I make my bed in hell , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art there .
if I take the w@@ ings of the morning , and d@@ well in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the sea ;
Ye@@ a , the d@@ ark@@ ness hi@@ de@@ th not from the@@ e ; but the night sh@@ in@@ eth as the day : the d@@ ark@@ ness and the light are both alike to the@@ e .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast poss@@ essed my re@@ ins : th@@ ou h@@ ast covered me in my mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
I will praise the@@ e ; for I am fear@@ fully and won@@ der@@ fully made : mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous are TH@@ Y works ; and that my sou@@ l know@@ eth right well .
my sub@@ stance was not hi@@ d from the@@ e , when I was made in secret , and cur@@ iously w@@ rought in the lowest parts of the ear@@ th .
Th@@ ine eyes did see my sub@@ stance , yet being un@@ perfect ; and in TH@@ Y book all my members were written , which in continu@@ ance were fas@@ hi@@ oned , when as yet there was none of them .
how pre@@ ci@@ ous also are TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts un@@ to me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
if I should count them , they are more in number than the s@@ and : when I aw@@ ake , I am still with the@@ e .
do not I h@@ ate them , O Lord , that h@@ ate the@@ e ? and am not I gri@@ ev@@ ed with those that rise up against the@@ e ?
deliver me , O Lord , from the ev@@ il man : preserve me from the violent man ;
which imag@@ ine mis@@ chiefs in their heart ; continu@@ ally are they gathered together for war .
they have shar@@ pen@@ ed their ton@@ gues like a ser@@ p@@ ent ; ad@@ ders ' po@@ ison is under their li@@ ps . Se@@ lah .
keep me , O Lord , from the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; preserve me from the violent man ; who have pur@@ posed to overthrow my go@@ ings .
the proud have hi@@ d a sn@@ are for me , and cor@@ ds ; they have spread a net by the w@@ ay@@ side ; they have set g@@ ins for me . Se@@ lah .
O God the Lord , the strength of my sal@@ vation , th@@ ou h@@ ast covered my head in the day of battle .
grant not , O Lord , the desi@@ res of the w@@ ic@@ ked : further not his w@@ ic@@ ked device ; lest they ex@@ alt themselves . Se@@ lah .
as for the head of those that comp@@ ass me about , let the mis@@ chief of their own li@@ ps cover them .
let burning co@@ als fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep p@@ its , that they rise not up again .
let not an ev@@ il speaker be established in the ear@@ th : ev@@ il shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the aff@@ lic@@ ted , and the right of the poor .
su@@ rely the righ@@ te@@ ous shall give thanks un@@ to TH@@ Y name : the u@@ pri@@ ght shall d@@ well in TH@@ Y presence .
Lord , I cry un@@ to the@@ e : make has@@ te un@@ to me ; give e@@ ar un@@ to my voice , when I cry un@@ to the@@ e .
let my pray@@ er be set forth before the@@ e as incen@@ se ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
set a watch , O Lord , before my m@@ outh ; keep the door of my li@@ ps .
In@@ cl@@ ine not my heart to any ev@@ il thing , to practi@@ se w@@ ic@@ ked works with men that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : and let me not eat of their da@@ in@@ ties .
when their judges are over@@ thrown in st@@ ony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are swe@@ et .
our b@@ ones are sc@@ at@@ tered at the grave 's m@@ outh , as when one cut@@ te@@ th and cle@@ av@@ eth wood upon the ear@@ th .
but mine eyes are un@@ to the@@ e , O God the Lord : in the@@ e is my trust ; leave not my sou@@ l de@@ stitute .
keep me from the s@@ nar@@ es which they have laid for me , and the g@@ ins of the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord with my voice ; with my voice un@@ to the Lord did I make my supp@@ lic@@ ation .
I p@@ oured out my complaint before him ; I she@@ wed before him my trouble .
when my spirit was overwhel@@ med within me , then th@@ ou k@@ newest my path . in the way where@@ in I walked have they priv@@ ily laid a sn@@ are for me .
I looked on my right hand , and be@@ held , but there was no man that would know me : ref@@ uge failed me ; no man car@@ ed for my sou@@ l .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord : I said , T@@ ho@@ u art my ref@@ uge and my portion in the land of the living .
attend un@@ to my cry ; for I am brought very low : deliver me from my persec@@ ut@@ ors ; for they are stronger than I@@ .
bring my sou@@ l out of prison , that I may praise TH@@ Y name : the righ@@ te@@ ous shall comp@@ ass me about ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt deal boun@@ ti@@ fully with me .
hear my pray@@ er , O Lord , give e@@ ar to my supp@@ lic@@ ations : in TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness answer me , and in TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and enter not into judgment with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : for in TH@@ Y sight shall no man living be justified .
for the enemy hat@@ h persec@@ uted my sou@@ l ; he hat@@ h s@@ mit@@ ten my life down to the ground ; he hat@@ h made me to d@@ well in d@@ ark@@ ness , as those that have been long dead .
therefore is my spirit overwhel@@ med within me ; my heart within me is de@@ so@@ late .
I remember the days of old ; I medi@@ t@@ ate on all TH@@ Y works ; I m@@ use on the work of TH@@ Y hands .
I stretch forth my hands un@@ to the@@ e : my sou@@ l thir@@ ste@@ th after the@@ e , as a thir@@ st@@ y land . Se@@ lah .
hear me spe@@ edil@@ y , O Lord : my spirit fail@@ eth : hide not TH@@ Y face from me , lest I be like un@@ to them that go down into the p@@ it .
cause me to hear TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the morning ; for in the@@ e do I trust : cause me to know the way where@@ in I should walk ; for I lift up my sou@@ l un@@ to the@@ e .
deliver me , O Lord , from mine enem@@ ies : I flee un@@ to the@@ e to hide me .
te@@ ach me to do TH@@ Y will ; for th@@ ou art my God : TH@@ Y spirit is good ; lead me into the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
Qu@@ ic@@ ken me , O Lord , for TH@@ Y name 's sake : for TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ' sake bring my sou@@ l out of trouble .
and of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy cut off mine enem@@ ies , and destroy all them that aff@@ lic@@ t my sou@@ l : for I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord my strength , which teach@@ eth my hands to war , and my fin@@ gers to fight :
my Go@@ od@@ ness , and my fortress ; my high to@@ wer , and my deliver@@ er ; my shield , and he in whom I trust ; who sub@@ du@@ eth my people under me .
Lord , what is man , that th@@ ou tak@@ est knowledge of him ! or the son of man , that th@@ ou mak@@ est account of him !
bo@@ w TH@@ Y heav@@ ens , O Lord , and come down : touch the mountains , and they shall smoke .
send th@@ ine hand from above ; rid me , and deliver me out of great waters , from the hand of st@@ range children ;
it is he that gi@@ vet@@ h sal@@ vation un@@ to kings : who deliver@@ eth David his ser@@ vant from the hur@@ t@@ ful s@@ word .
rid me , and deliver me from the hand of st@@ range children , whose m@@ outh speak@@ eth van@@ ity , and their right hand is a right hand of fal@@ se@@ hood :
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth ; that our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters may be as cor@@ ner stones , pol@@ ished after the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of a palace :
that our gar@@ ners may be full , affor@@ ding all manner of store : that our she@@ ep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets :
that our ox@@ en may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no compla@@ ining in our streets .
happy is that people , that is in such a case : ye@@ a , happy is that people , whose God is the Lord .
I will ex@@ to@@ l the@@ e , my God , O king ; and I will b@@ less TH@@ Y name for ever and ever .
every day will I b@@ less the@@ e ; and I will praise TH@@ Y name for ever and ever .
one generation shall praise TH@@ Y works to another , and shall declare TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty acts .
I will speak of the g@@ lor@@ ious honour of TH@@ Y maj@@ es@@ ty , and of TH@@ Y won@@ dro@@ us works .
and men shall speak of the might of TH@@ Y ter@@ ri@@ ble acts : and I will declare TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness .
they shall ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ut@@ ter the memory of TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness , and shall sing of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
the Lord is gr@@ ac@@ ious , and full of comp@@ as@@ sion ; slow to an@@ ger , and of great mer@@ cy .
the Lord is good to all : and his tender mer@@ cies are over all his works .
they shall speak of the gl@@ ory of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom , and talk of TH@@ Y power ;
to make known to the sons of men his m@@ igh@@ ty acts , and the g@@ lor@@ ious maj@@ es@@ ty of his k@@ ing@@ dom .
the Lord up@@ hol@@ de@@ th all that fall , and ra@@ is@@ eth up all those that be bo@@ wed down .
the eyes of all wait upon the@@ e ; and th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est them their meat in due season .
T@@ ho@@ u open@@ est th@@ ine hand , and satis@@ fi@@ est the desire of every living thing .
the Lord is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his ways , and hol@@ y in all his works .
the Lord is n@@ igh un@@ to all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
while I live will I praise the Lord : I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to my God while I have any being .
put not your trust in pr@@ inces , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
his bre@@ ath go@@ eth forth , he retur@@ net@@ h to his ear@@ th ; in that very day his th@@ ou@@ ghts per@@ ish .
happy is he that hat@@ h the God of Jac@@ o@@ b for his help , whose hope is in the Lord his God :
which made heav@@ en , and ear@@ th , the sea , and all that there@@ in is : which keep@@ eth truth for ever :
which execu@@ te@@ th judgment for the op@@ pressed : which gi@@ vet@@ h food to the hun@@ gry . the Lord lo@@ os@@ eth the prisoners :
the Lord open@@ eth the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d : the Lord ra@@ is@@ eth them that are bo@@ wed down : the Lord lov@@ eth the righ@@ te@@ ous :
the Lord preser@@ vet@@ h the st@@ ran@@ gers ; he reli@@ ev@@ eth the fa@@ ther@@ less and wi@@ dow : but the way of the w@@ ic@@ ked he tur@@ net@@ h U@@ p@@ side down .
he tel@@ le@@ th the number of the stars ; he cal@@ le@@ th them all by their names .
great is our Lord , and of great power : his understanding is in@@ fin@@ ite .
the Lord lif@@ te@@ th up the me@@ ek : he cas@@ te@@ th the w@@ ic@@ ked down to the ground .
who cover@@ eth the heav@@ en with cl@@ ou@@ ds , who prepar@@ eth rain for the ear@@ th , who mak@@ eth gr@@ ass to grow upon the mountains .
he gi@@ vet@@ h to the be@@ ast his food , and to the young ra@@ ven@@ s which cry .
he deli@@ gh@@ te@@ th not in the strength of the hor@@ se : he tak@@ eth not pleas@@ ure in the leg@@ s of a man .
the Lord tak@@ eth pleas@@ ure in them that fear him , in those that hope in his mer@@ cy .
for he hat@@ h strengthened the bars of TH@@ Y gates ; he hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed TH@@ Y children within the@@ e .
he mak@@ eth peace in TH@@ Y borders , and fil@@ le@@ th the@@ e with the fin@@ est of the wheat .
he sen@@ de@@ th forth his comman@@ d@@ ment upon ear@@ th : his word run@@ net@@ h very swi@@ f@@ tly .
he sen@@ de@@ th out his word , and mel@@ te@@ th them : he ca@@ us@@ eth his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
he hat@@ h also st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed them for ever and ever : he hat@@ h made a decree which shall not pass .
let them praise the name of the Lord : for his name alone is excellent ; his gl@@ ory is above the ear@@ th and heav@@ en .
he also ex@@ al@@ te@@ th the Hor@@ n of his people , the praise of all his sa@@ ints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near un@@ to him . praise ye the Lord .
let Israel re@@ jo@@ ice in him that made him : let the children of Z@@ ion be jo@@ y@@ ful in their King .
let them praise his name in the dance : let them sing pra@@ ises un@@ to him with the tim@@ bre@@ l and har@@ p .
for the Lord tak@@ eth pleas@@ ure in his people : he will be@@ auti@@ fy the me@@ ek with sal@@ vation .
let the high pra@@ ises of God be in their m@@ outh , and a t@@ wo@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word in their hand ;
to bin@@ d their kings with cha@@ ins , and their no@@ bles with f@@ et@@ ters of iron ;
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fo@@ ols desp@@ ise wis@@ dom and in@@ struction .
my son , hear the in@@ struction of TH@@ Y father , and for@@ sake not the law of TH@@ Y mother :
let us sw@@ allow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the p@@ it :
my son , walk not th@@ ou in the way with them ; refrain TH@@ Y fo@@ ot from their path :
su@@ rely in v@@ ain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
so are the ways of every one that is gre@@ edy of gain ; which tak@@ eth away the life of the owners there@@ of .
she cri@@ eth in the chief place of con@@ course , in the open@@ ings of the gates : in the city she ut@@ ter@@ eth her words , saying ,
turn you at my re@@ proof : be@@ hold , I will p@@ our out my spirit un@@ to you , I will make known my words un@@ to you .
because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stret@@ ched out my hand , and no man regarded ;
but ye have set at n@@ ought all my coun@@ sel , and would none of my re@@ proof :
then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
for that they ha@@ ted knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord :
they would none of my coun@@ sel : they desp@@ ised all my re@@ proof .
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices .
for the turning away of the simple shall s@@ lay them , and the prosperity of fo@@ ols shall destroy them .
Ye@@ a , if th@@ ou cri@@ est after knowledge , and lif@@ test up TH@@ Y voice for understanding ;
then s@@ halt th@@ ou understand the fear of the Lord , and find the knowledge of God .
he lay@@ eth up sound wis@@ dom for the righ@@ te@@ ous : he is a bu@@ ck@@ ler to them that walk u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly .
when wis@@ dom enter@@ eth into th@@ ine heart , and knowledge is pleas@@ ant un@@ to TH@@ Y sou@@ l ;
to deliver the@@ e from the way of the ev@@ il man , from the man that speak@@ eth fro@@ ward things ;
whose ways are cro@@ oked , and they fro@@ ward in their p@@ aths :
none that go un@@ to her return again , neither take they hold of the p@@ aths of life .
that th@@ ou may@@ est walk in the way of good men , and keep the p@@ aths of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be cut off from the ear@@ th , and the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall be rooted out of it .
for length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to the@@ e .
let not mer@@ cy and truth for@@ sake the@@ e : bin@@ d them about TH@@ Y nec@@ k ; write them upon the table of th@@ ine heart :
so s@@ halt th@@ ou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
trust in the Lord with all th@@ ine heart ; and le@@ an not un@@ to th@@ ine own understanding .
it shall be health to TH@@ Y nav@@ el , and mar@@ row to TH@@ Y b@@ ones .
honour the Lord with TH@@ Y sub@@ stance , and with the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all th@@ ine increase :
so shall TH@@ Y bar@@ ns be filled with plenty , and TH@@ Y pres@@ ses shall bur@@ st out with new wine .
my son , desp@@ ise not the ch@@ as@@ tening of the Lord ; neither be we@@ ary of his correc@@ tion :
for whom the Lord lov@@ eth he correc@@ te@@ th ; even as a father the son in whom he deli@@ gh@@ te@@ th .
happy is the man that fin@@ de@@ th wis@@ dom , and the man that get@@ te@@ th understanding .
for the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of it is better than the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of silver , and the gain there@@ of than fine gold .
she is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than ru@@ bies : and all the things th@@ ou can@@ st desire are not to be compared un@@ to her .
the is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that re@@ tain@@ eth her .
the Lord by wis@@ dom hat@@ h founded the ear@@ th ; by understanding hat@@ h he established the heav@@ ens .
by his knowledge the dep@@ ths are broken up , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds drop down the dew .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou walk in TH@@ Y way saf@@ ely , and TH@@ Y fo@@ ot shall not st@@ um@@ ble .
when th@@ ou li@@ est down , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be afraid : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt lie down , and TH@@ Y sle@@ ep shall be swe@@ et .
be not afraid of su@@ dden fear , neither of the de@@ so@@ lation of the w@@ ic@@ ked , when it co@@ me@@ th .
for the Lord shall be TH@@ Y confidence , and shall keep TH@@ Y fo@@ ot from being taken .
with@@ hold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of th@@ ine hand to do it .
say not un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour , G@@ o , and come again , and to mor@@ row I will give ; when th@@ ou h@@ ast it by the@@ e .
dev@@ ise not ev@@ il against TH@@ Y neighbour , seeing he d@@ wel@@ le@@ th sec@@ u@@ rely by the@@ e .
strive not with a man without cause , if he have done the@@ e no harm .
for the fro@@ ward is ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but his secret is with the righ@@ te@@ ous .
the cur@@ se of the Lord is in the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked : but he b@@ les@@ set@@ h the habi@@ tation of the just .
for I was my father 's son , tender and only bel@@ ov@@ ed in the sight of my mother .
he ta@@ ught me also , and said un@@ to me , Let th@@ ine heart retain my words : keep my comman@@ d@@ ments , and live .
get wis@@ dom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my m@@ outh .
Ex@@ alt her , and she shall promote the@@ e : she shall bring the@@ e to honour , when th@@ ou dost em@@ br@@ ace her .
she shall give to th@@ ine head an or@@ nament of grace : a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory shall she deliver to the@@ e .
hear , O my son , and receive my say@@ ings ; and the years of TH@@ Y life shall be many .
I have ta@@ ught the@@ e in the way of wis@@ dom ; I have led the@@ e in right p@@ aths .
when th@@ ou go@@ est , TH@@ Y steps shall not be stra@@ it@@ ened ; and when th@@ ou run@@ n@@ est , th@@ ou s@@ halt not st@@ um@@ ble .
take fast hold of in@@ struction ; let her not go : keep her ; for she is TH@@ Y life .
enter not into the path of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and go not in the way of ev@@ il men .
for they sle@@ ep not , except they have done mis@@ chief ; and their sle@@ ep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
for they eat the bread of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and drink the wine of violence .
but the path of the just is as the sh@@ ining light , that sh@@ in@@ eth more and more un@@ to the perfect day .
the way of the w@@ ic@@ ked is as d@@ ark@@ ness : they know not at what they st@@ um@@ ble .
let them not de@@ part from th@@ ine eyes ; keep them in the mid@@ st of th@@ ine heart .
for they are life un@@ to those that find them , and health to all their f@@ les@@ h .
put away from the@@ e a fro@@ ward m@@ outh , and per@@ verse li@@ ps put far from the@@ e .
let th@@ ine eyes look right on , and let th@@ ine ey@@ eli@@ ds look stra@@ ight before the@@ e .
turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove TH@@ Y fo@@ ot from ev@@ il .
for the li@@ ps of a st@@ range woman drop as an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and her m@@ outh is smo@@ other than oil :
L@@ est th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest pon@@ der the path of life , her ways are mov@@ eable , that th@@ ou can@@ st not know them .
hear me now therefore , O ye children , and de@@ part not from the words of my m@@ outh .
remove TH@@ Y way far from her , and come not n@@ igh the door of her house :
L@@ est st@@ ran@@ gers be filled with TH@@ Y wealth ; and TH@@ Y la@@ bour@@ s be in the house of a st@@ ran@@ ger ;
and have not obe@@ yed the voice of my teachers , nor inc@@ lined mine e@@ ar to them that instruc@@ ted me !
drink waters out of th@@ ine own c@@ ister@@ n , and running waters out of th@@ ine own well .
let TH@@ Y fo@@ un@@ tains be disper@@ sed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets .
let her be as the lov@@ ing h@@ ind and pleas@@ ant ro@@ e ; let her bre@@ asts satisfy the@@ e at all times ; and be th@@ ou ra@@ vis@@ hed always with her love .
and why w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou , my son , be ra@@ vis@@ hed with a st@@ range woman , and em@@ br@@ ace the bos@@ om of a st@@ ran@@ ger ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord , and he pon@@ der@@ eth all his go@@ ings .
his own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities shall take the w@@ ic@@ ked himself , and he shall be hol@@ den with the cor@@ ds of his sin@@ s .
he shall die without in@@ struction ; and in the gre@@ at@@ ness of his Fol@@ ly he shall go as@@ tra@@ y .
my son , if th@@ ou be su@@ re@@ ty for TH@@ Y friend , if th@@ ou h@@ ast stric@@ ken TH@@ Y hand with a st@@ ran@@ ger ,
T@@ ho@@ u art s@@ nar@@ ed with the words of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , th@@ ou art taken with the words of TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
do this now , my son , deliver th@@ y@@ self , when th@@ ou art come into the hand of TH@@ Y friend ; go , hum@@ ble th@@ y@@ self , and make sure TH@@ Y friend .
deliver th@@ y@@ self as a ro@@ e from the hand of the hun@@ ter , and as a bird from the hand of the fo@@ w@@ ler .
Pro@@ vide@@ th her meat in the summer , and gather@@ eth her food in the har@@ v@@ est .
an heart that dev@@ is@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked imag@@ inations , feet that be swift in running to mis@@ chief ,
when th@@ ou go@@ est , it shall lead the@@ e ; when th@@ ou sle@@ ep@@ est , it shall keep the@@ e ; and when th@@ ou aw@@ ak@@ est , it shall talk with the@@ e .
for the comman@@ d@@ ment is a lam@@ p ; and the law is light ; and re@@ pro@@ of@@ s of in@@ struction are the way of life :
to keep the@@ e from the ev@@ il woman , from the f@@ lat@@ tery of the ton@@ gue of a st@@ range woman .
L@@ ust not after her beauty in th@@ ine heart ; neither let her take the@@ e with her ey@@ eli@@ ds .
can a man take fire in his bos@@ om , and his clo@@ th@@ es not be burned ?
men do not desp@@ ise a th@@ i@@ ef , if he ste@@ al to satisfy his sou@@ l when he is hun@@ gry ;
but wh@@ os@@ o commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery with a woman la@@ c@@ ket@@ h understanding : he that do@@ eth it destro@@ yet@@ h his own sou@@ l .
a wo@@ und and dis@@ honour shall he get ; and his re@@ pro@@ ach shall not be wi@@ ped away .
for je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is the ra@@ ge of a man : therefore he will not spar@@ e in the day of ven@@ ge@@ ance .
he will not regard any ran@@ so@@ m ; neither will he rest content , though th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est many gifts .
that they may keep the@@ e from the st@@ range woman , from the st@@ ran@@ ger which f@@ lat@@ ter@@ eth with her words .
and be@@ held among the simple ones , I dis@@ cer@@ ned among the you@@ ths , a young man vo@@ id of understanding ,
and , be@@ hold , there met him a woman with the at@@ tire of an har@@ lot , and sub@@ til of heart .
now is she without , now in the streets , and li@@ eth in wait at every cor@@ ner . )
so she caught him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and with an imp@@ u@@ dent face said un@@ to him ,
therefore came I forth to meet the@@ e , dil@@ ig@@ ently to seek TH@@ Y face , and I have found the@@ e .
I have dec@@ ked my bed with cover@@ ings of tap@@ es@@ try , with car@@ ved works , with fine lin@@ en of Egypt .
for the Go@@ od@@ man is not at home , he is gone a long journey :
he hat@@ h taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield , with the f@@ lat@@ tering of her li@@ ps she forced him .
he go@@ eth after her stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay , as an o@@ x go@@ eth to the sla@@ ughter , or as a fo@@ ol to the correc@@ tion of the sto@@ cks ;
ti@@ ll a d@@ art strike through his li@@ ver ; as a bird has@@ te@@ th to the sn@@ are , and know@@ eth not that it is for his life .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me now therefore , O ye children , and attend to the words of my m@@ outh .
let not th@@ ine heart decline to her ways , go not as@@ tra@@ y in her p@@ aths .
for she hat@@ h cast down many wounded : ye@@ a , many strong men have been sla@@ in by her .
she stan@@ de@@ th in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the p@@ aths .
she cri@@ eth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
un@@ to you , O men , I call ; and my voice is to the sons of man .
hear ; for I will speak of excellent things ; and the opening of my li@@ ps shall be right things .
for my m@@ outh shall speak truth ; and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to my li@@ ps .
all the words of my m@@ outh are in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; there is nothing fro@@ ward or per@@ verse in them .
for wis@@ dom is better than ru@@ bies ; and all the things that may be desi@@ red are not to be compared to it .
the fear of the Lord is to h@@ ate ev@@ il : pride , and ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy , and the ev@@ il way , and the fro@@ ward m@@ outh , do I h@@ ate .
by me pr@@ inces rule , and no@@ bles , even all the judges of the ear@@ th .
my fruit is better than gold , ye@@ a , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
I lead in the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , in the mid@@ st of the p@@ aths of judgment :
that I may cause those that love me to inher@@ it sub@@ stance ; and I will fill their treasures .
the Lord poss@@ essed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
when there were no dep@@ ths , I was brought forth ; when there were no fo@@ un@@ tains ab@@ oun@@ ding with water .
when he prepared the heav@@ ens , I was there : when he set a comp@@ ass upon the face of the dep@@ th :
when he established the cl@@ ou@@ ds above : when he strengthened the fo@@ un@@ tains of the deep :
when he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his comman@@ d@@ ment : when he appointed the foundations of the ear@@ th :
then I was by him , as one brought up with him : and I was daily his de@@ light , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing always before him ;
Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing in the habi@@ table part of his ear@@ th ; and my deli@@ ghts were with the sons of men .
now therefore he@@ arken un@@ to me , O ye children : for b@@ les@@ sed are they that keep my ways .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that he@@ aret@@ h me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
she hat@@ h killed her be@@ asts ; she hat@@ h min@@ g@@ led her wine ; she hat@@ h also fur@@ n@@ ished her table .
she hat@@ h sent forth her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s : she cri@@ eth upon the highest places of the city ,
W@@ hos@@ o is simple , let him turn in hi@@ ther : as for him that wan@@ te@@ th understanding , she sa@@ ith to him ,
he that re@@ pro@@ vet@@ h a scor@@ ner get@@ te@@ th to himself sh@@ ame : and he that re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h a w@@ ic@@ ked man get@@ te@@ th himself a blo@@ t .
Re@@ prove not a scor@@ ner , lest he h@@ ate the@@ e : re@@ bu@@ ke a wise man , and he will love the@@ e .
give in@@ struction to a wise man , and he will be yet wis@@ er : te@@ ach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wis@@ dom : and the knowledge of the hol@@ y is understanding .
for by me TH@@ Y days shall be multi@@ p@@ lied , and the years of TH@@ Y life shall be increased .
if th@@ ou be wise , th@@ ou s@@ halt be wise for th@@ y@@ self : but if th@@ ou scor@@ n@@ est , th@@ ou alone s@@ halt bear it .
W@@ hos@@ o is simple , let him turn in hi@@ ther : and as for him that wan@@ te@@ th understanding , she sa@@ ith to him ,
the Pro@@ ver@@ bs of Solomon . a wise son mak@@ eth a glad father : but a fo@@ ol@@ ish son is the heav@@ iness of his mother .
the Lord will not suffer the sou@@ l of the righ@@ te@@ ous to fam@@ ish : but he cas@@ te@@ th away the sub@@ stance of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
he bec@@ o@@ me@@ th poor that deal@@ eth with a S@@ lack hand : but the hand of the dil@@ ig@@ ent mak@@ eth rich .
he that gather@@ eth in summer is a wise son : but he that sle@@ ep@@ eth in har@@ v@@ est is a son that ca@@ us@@ eth sh@@ ame .
B@@ les@@ s@@ ings are upon the head of the just : but violence cover@@ eth the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the memory of the just is b@@ les@@ sed : but the name of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall ro@@ t .
the m@@ outh of a righ@@ te@@ ous man is a well of life : but violence cover@@ eth the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
in the li@@ ps of him that hat@@ h understanding wis@@ dom is found : but a ro@@ d is for the back of him that is vo@@ id of understanding .
the rich man 's wealth is his strong city : the destruction of the poor is their poverty .
the labour of the righ@@ te@@ ous ten@@ de@@ th to life : the fruit of the w@@ ic@@ ked to sin .
he that hi@@ de@@ th hatred with lying li@@ ps , and he that ut@@ ter@@ eth a s@@ lan@@ der , is a fo@@ ol .
in the multi@@ tude of words there wan@@ te@@ th not sin : but he that ref@@ ra@@ in@@ eth his li@@ ps is wise .
the ton@@ gue of the just is as choice silver : the heart of the w@@ ic@@ ked is little worth .
the fear of the w@@ ic@@ ked , it shall come upon him : but the desire of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be granted .
as vin@@ eg@@ ar to the te@@ eth , and as smoke to the eyes , so is the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d to them that send him .
the fear of the Lord prol@@ on@@ get@@ h days : but the years of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be shor@@ tened .
the hope of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be gla@@ d@@ ness : but the expec@@ tation of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall per@@ ish .
the way of the Lord is strength to the u@@ pri@@ ght : but destruction shall be to the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
the m@@ outh of the just br@@ ing@@ eth forth wis@@ dom : but the fro@@ ward ton@@ gue shall be cut out .
the li@@ ps of the righ@@ te@@ ous know what is acceptable : but the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked speak@@ eth fro@@ war@@ d@@ ness .
a false balance is ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but a just weight is his de@@ light .
when pride co@@ me@@ th , then co@@ me@@ th sh@@ ame : but with the low@@ ly is wis@@ dom .
the integrity of the u@@ pri@@ ght shall guide them : but the per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess of trans@@ gres@@ sors shall destroy them .
the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the perfect shall direct his way : but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall fall by his own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the u@@ pri@@ ght shall deliver them : but trans@@ gres@@ sors shall be taken in their own na@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess .
when a w@@ ic@@ ked man di@@ eth , his expec@@ tation shall per@@ ish : and the hope of un@@ just men per@@ is@@ het@@ h .
when it go@@ eth well with the righ@@ te@@ ous , the city re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth : and when the w@@ ic@@ ked per@@ ish , there is sh@@ ou@@ ting .
by the b@@ les@@ sing of the u@@ pri@@ ght the city is ex@@ al@@ ted : but it is over@@ thrown by the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
he that is vo@@ id of wis@@ dom desp@@ is@@ eth his neighbour : but a man of understanding hol@@ de@@ th his peace .
a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts : but he that is of a fa@@ ith@@ ful spirit conce@@ al@@ eth the matter .
where no coun@@ sel is , the people fall : but in the multi@@ tude of coun@@ sel@@ lers there is safety .
he that is su@@ re@@ ty for a st@@ ran@@ ger shall s@@ mar@@ t for it : and he that ha@@ te@@ th su@@ reti@@ ship is sure .
a gr@@ ac@@ ious woman re@@ tain@@ eth honour : and strong men retain ri@@ ches .
the mer@@ ci@@ ful man do@@ eth good to his own sou@@ l : but he that is cru@@ el troub@@ le@@ th his own f@@ les@@ h .
the w@@ ic@@ ked wor@@ ket@@ h a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful work : but to him that so@@ w@@ eth righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be a sure reward .
as righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ten@@ de@@ th to life : so he that pursu@@ eth ev@@ il pursu@@ eth it to his own death .
they that are of a fro@@ ward heart are ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but such as are u@@ pri@@ ght in their way are his de@@ light .
though hand join in hand , the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be un@@ punished : but the se@@ ed of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be delivered .
as a je@@ w@@ el of gold in a sw@@ ine 's sn@@ out , so is a fair woman which is without discre@@ tion .
the desire of the righ@@ te@@ ous is only good : but the expec@@ tation of the w@@ ic@@ ked is wr@@ ath .
there is that sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth , and yet increas@@ eth ; and there is that with@@ hol@@ de@@ th more than is meet , but it ten@@ de@@ th to poverty .
the liberal sou@@ l shall be made f@@ at : and he that water@@ eth shall be wat@@ ered also himself .
he that with@@ hol@@ de@@ th cor@@ n , the people shall cur@@ se him : but b@@ les@@ sing shall be upon the head of him that sel@@ le@@ th it .
he that dil@@ ig@@ ently seek@@ eth good proc@@ ure@@ th favour : but he that seek@@ eth mis@@ chief , it shall come un@@ to him .
he that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in his ri@@ ches shall fall : but the righ@@ te@@ ous shall flo@@ ur@@ ish as a branch .
he that troub@@ le@@ th his own house shall inher@@ it the wind : and the fo@@ ol shall be ser@@ vant to the wise of heart .
the fruit of the righ@@ te@@ ous is a tree of life ; and he that win@@ net@@ h so@@ ul@@ s is wise .
be@@ hold , the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be re@@ compen@@ sed in the ear@@ th : much more the w@@ ic@@ ked and the sin@@ ner .
a good man ob@@ tain@@ eth favour of the Lord : but a man of w@@ ic@@ ked devices will he condemn .
a man shall not be established by w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : but the root of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall not be moved .
a vir@@ tu@@ ous woman is a cro@@ wn to her husband : but she that mak@@ eth as@@ ha@@ med is as rot@@ ten@@ ness in his b@@ ones .
the th@@ ou@@ ghts of the righ@@ te@@ ous are right : but the coun@@ sels of the w@@ ic@@ ked are dec@@ e@@ it .
the words of the w@@ ic@@ ked are to lie in wait for blood : but the m@@ outh of the u@@ pri@@ ght shall deliver them .
the w@@ ic@@ ked are over@@ thrown , and are not : but the house of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall stand .
a man shall be commen@@ ded according to his wis@@ dom : but he that is of a per@@ verse heart shall be desp@@ ised .
he that is desp@@ ised , and hat@@ h a ser@@ vant , is better than he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th himself , and la@@ c@@ ket@@ h bread .
a righ@@ te@@ ous man regar@@ de@@ th the life of his be@@ ast : but the tender mer@@ cies of the w@@ ic@@ ked are cru@@ el .
he that til@@ le@@ th his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that follow@@ eth v@@ ain persons is vo@@ id of understanding .
the w@@ ic@@ ked is s@@ nar@@ ed by the trans@@ gres@@ sion of his li@@ ps : but the just shall come out of trouble .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his m@@ outh : and the re@@ comp@@ ence of a man 's hands shall be ren@@ dered un@@ to him .
the way of a fo@@ ol is right in his own eyes : but he that hear@@ ken@@ eth un@@ to coun@@ sel is wise .
there is that speak@@ eth like the pi@@ erc@@ ings of a s@@ word : but the ton@@ gue of the wise is health .
the li@@ p of truth shall be established for ever : but a lying ton@@ gue is but for a moment .
D@@ ece@@ it is in the heart of them that imag@@ ine ev@@ il : but to the coun@@ sel@@ lers of peace is joy .
there shall no ev@@ il happen to the just : but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be filled with mis@@ chief .
lying li@@ ps are ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but they that deal truly are his de@@ light .
the hand of the dil@@ ig@@ ent shall bear rule : but the slo@@ th@@ ful shall be under tri@@ bute .
He@@ av@@ iness in the heart of man mak@@ eth it st@@ oo@@ p : but a good word mak@@ eth it glad .
the slo@@ th@@ ful man ro@@ as@@ te@@ th not that which he took in hun@@ ting : but the sub@@ stance of a dil@@ ig@@ ent man is pre@@ ci@@ ous .
in the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is life ; and in the path@@ way there@@ of there is no death .
a man shall eat good by the fruit of his m@@ outh : but the sou@@ l of the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall eat violence .
he that keep@@ eth his m@@ outh keep@@ eth his life : but he that open@@ eth wide his li@@ ps shall have destruction .
the sou@@ l of the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d desi@@ re@@ th , and hat@@ h nothing : but the sou@@ l of the dil@@ ig@@ ent shall be made f@@ at .
R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous@@ ness keep@@ eth him that is u@@ pri@@ ght in the way : but w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess over@@ thro@@ w@@ eth the sin@@ ner .
there is that mak@@ eth himself rich , yet hat@@ h nothing : there is that mak@@ eth himself poor , yet hat@@ h great ri@@ ches .
the light of the righ@@ te@@ ous re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth : but the lam@@ p of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put out .
hope def@@ er@@ red mak@@ eth the heart si@@ ck : but when the desire co@@ me@@ th , it is a tree of life .
W@@ hos@@ o desp@@ is@@ eth the word shall be destroyed : but he that fear@@ eth the comman@@ d@@ ment shall be re@@ warded .
the law of the wise is a fo@@ un@@ tain of life , to de@@ part from the s@@ nar@@ es of death .
good understanding gi@@ vet@@ h favour : but the way of trans@@ gres@@ sors is hard .
poverty and sh@@ ame shall be to him that ref@@ us@@ eth in@@ struction : but he that regar@@ de@@ th re@@ proof shall be honoured .
the desire accomplished is swe@@ et to the sou@@ l : but it is ab@@ omin@@ ation to fo@@ ols to de@@ part from ev@@ il .
he that walk@@ eth with wise men shall be wise : but a compan@@ ion of fo@@ ols shall be destroyed .
a good man le@@ av@@ eth an inher@@ it@@ ance to his children 's children : and the wealth of the sin@@ ner is laid up for the just .
much food is in the til@@ la@@ ge of the poor : but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment .
the righ@@ te@@ ous e@@ ate@@ th to the satis@@ fying of his sou@@ l : but the bel@@ ly of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall want .
he that walk@@ eth in his u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness fear@@ eth the Lord : but he that is per@@ verse in his ways desp@@ is@@ eth him .
in the m@@ outh of the fo@@ ol@@ ish is a ro@@ d of pride : but the li@@ ps of the wise shall preserve them .
where no ox@@ en are , the cri@@ b is clean : but much increase is by the strength of the o@@ x .
a scor@@ ner seek@@ eth wis@@ dom , and fin@@ de@@ th it not : but knowledge is easy un@@ to him that under@@ stan@@ de@@ th .
go from the presence of a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , when th@@ ou perce@@ iv@@ est not in him the li@@ ps of knowledge .
the wis@@ dom of the pru@@ dent is to understand his way : but the Fol@@ ly of fo@@ ols is dec@@ e@@ it .
the heart know@@ eth his own bit@@ ter@@ ness ; and a st@@ ran@@ ger do@@ th not inter@@ med@@ dle with his joy .
there is a way which se@@ eme@@ th right un@@ to a man , but the end there@@ of are the ways of death .
the back@@ s@@ lider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
he that is soon angry deal@@ eth fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : and a man of w@@ ic@@ ked devices is ha@@ ted .
the ev@@ il bo@@ w before the good ; and the w@@ ic@@ ked at the gates of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
the poor is ha@@ ted even of his own neighbour : but the rich hat@@ h many friends .
he that desp@@ is@@ eth his neighbour sin@@ net@@ h : but he that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the poor , happy is he .
do they not er@@ r that dev@@ ise ev@@ il ? but mer@@ cy and truth shall be to them that dev@@ ise good .
in all labour there is profit : but the talk of the li@@ ps ten@@ de@@ th only to pen@@ ury .
in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence : and his children shall have a place of ref@@ uge .
the fear of the Lord is a fo@@ un@@ tain of life , to de@@ part from the s@@ nar@@ es of death .
in the multi@@ tude of people is the king 's honour : but in the want of people is the destruction of the pr@@ ince .
he that is slow to wr@@ ath is of great understanding : but he that is has@@ ty of spirit ex@@ al@@ te@@ th Fol@@ ly .
he that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h the poor re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth his Mak@@ er : but he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th him hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the poor .
wis@@ dom res@@ te@@ th in the heart of him that hat@@ h understanding : but that which is in the mid@@ st of fo@@ ols is made known .
the king 's favour is toward a wise ser@@ vant : but his wr@@ ath is against him that ca@@ us@@ eth sh@@ ame .
the ton@@ gue of the wise us@@ eth knowledge ar@@ ight : but the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out fo@@ ol@@ ishness .
a who@@ le@@ some ton@@ gue is a tree of life : but per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess there@@ in is a breach in the spirit .
in the house of the righ@@ te@@ ous is much treasure : but in the revenues of the w@@ ic@@ ked is trouble .
the li@@ ps of the wise disper@@ se knowledge : but the heart of the fo@@ ol@@ ish do@@ eth not so .
the sacrifice of the w@@ ic@@ ked is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but the pray@@ er of the u@@ pri@@ ght is his de@@ light .
the way of the w@@ ic@@ ked is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord : but he lov@@ eth him that follow@@ eth after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
correc@@ tion is gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to him that for@@ sak@@ eth the way : and he that ha@@ te@@ th re@@ proof shall die .
a scor@@ ner lov@@ eth not one that re@@ pro@@ vet@@ h him : neither will he go un@@ to the wise .
a mer@@ ry heart mak@@ eth a che@@ er@@ ful coun@@ tenance : but by sor@@ row of the heart the spirit is broken .
the heart of him that hat@@ h understanding seek@@ eth knowledge : but the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols fe@@ ede@@ th on fo@@ ol@@ ishness .
all the days of the aff@@ lic@@ ted are ev@@ il : but he that is of a mer@@ ry heart hat@@ h a contin@@ ual feast .
a wra@@ th@@ ful man s@@ tir@@ re@@ th up stri@@ fe : but he that is slow to an@@ ger appe@@ as@@ eth stri@@ fe .
the way of the slo@@ th@@ ful man is as an h@@ edge of thor@@ ns : but the way of the righ@@ te@@ ous is made pla@@ in .
a wise son mak@@ eth a glad father : but a fo@@ ol@@ ish man desp@@ is@@ eth his mother .
a man hat@@ h joy by the answer of his m@@ outh : and a word spoken in due season , how good is it !
the Lord will destroy the house of the proud : but he will establish the border of the wi@@ dow .
the th@@ ou@@ ghts of the w@@ ic@@ ked are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but the words of the p@@ ure are pleas@@ ant words .
the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous stu@@ di@@ eth to answer : but the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out ev@@ il things .
the Lord is far from the w@@ ic@@ ked : but he he@@ aret@@ h the pray@@ er of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
the light of the eyes re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth the heart : and a good report mak@@ eth the b@@ ones f@@ at .
the fear of the Lord is the in@@ struction of wis@@ dom ; and before honour is hum@@ il@@ ity .
the preparations of the heart in man , and the answer of the ton@@ gue , is from the Lord .
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but the Lord weigh@@ eth the spir@@ its .
every one that is proud in heart is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : though hand join in hand , he shall not be un@@ punished .
by mer@@ cy and truth in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is p@@ urged : and by the fear of the Lord men de@@ part from ev@@ il .
when a man 's ways ple@@ ase the Lord , he mak@@ eth even his enem@@ ies to be at peace with him .
a just weight and balance are the Lord 's : all the we@@ ights of the bag are his work .
it is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to kings to commit w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : for the th@@ r@@ one is established by righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous li@@ ps are the de@@ light of kings ; and they love him that speak@@ eth right .
the wr@@ ath of a king is as mes@@ sen@@ gers of death : but a wise man will p@@ ac@@ ify it .
in the light of the king 's coun@@ tenance is life ; and his favour is as a cl@@ oud of the latter rain .
how much better is it to get wis@@ dom than gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !
the highway of the u@@ pri@@ ght is to de@@ part from ev@@ il : he that keep@@ eth his way preser@@ vet@@ h his sou@@ l .
better it is to be of an hum@@ ble spirit with the low@@ ly , than to divide the sp@@ oil with the proud .
he that hand@@ le@@ th a matter wis@@ ely shall find good : and wh@@ os@@ o tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the Lord , happy is he .
the wise in heart shall be called pru@@ dent : and the swe@@ et@@ ness of the li@@ ps increas@@ eth learning .
understanding is a wel@@ l@@ spring of life un@@ to him that hat@@ h it : but the in@@ struction of fo@@ ols is Fol@@ ly .
there is a way that se@@ eme@@ th right un@@ to a man , but the end there@@ of are the ways of death .
an un@@ go@@ dly man dig@@ get@@ h up ev@@ il : and in his li@@ ps there is as a burning fire .
a violent man en@@ tic@@ eth his neighbour , and le@@ ade@@ th him into the way that is not good .
he shut@@ te@@ th his eyes to dev@@ ise fro@@ ward things : moving his li@@ ps he br@@ ing@@ eth ev@@ il to pass .
the ho@@ ary head is a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory , if it be found in the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
he that is slow to an@@ ger is better than the m@@ igh@@ ty ; and he that ru@@ le@@ th his spirit than he that tak@@ eth a city .
the lot is cast into the la@@ p ; but the whole dis@@ posing there@@ of is of the Lord .
better is a d@@ ry mor@@ sel , and qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness there@@ with , than an house full of sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es with stri@@ fe .
a wise ser@@ vant shall have rule over a son that ca@@ us@@ eth sh@@ ame , and shall have part of the inher@@ it@@ ance among the bre@@ th@@ ren .
the fin@@ ing po@@ t is for silver , and the fur@@ n@@ ace for gold : but the Lord tri@@ eth the hear@@ ts .
W@@ hos@@ o mo@@ c@@ ket@@ h the poor re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth his Mak@@ er : and he that is glad at cal@@ am@@ ities shall not be un@@ punished .
a gift is as a pre@@ ci@@ ous stone in the eyes of him that hat@@ h it : w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever it tur@@ net@@ h , it prosp@@ er@@ eth .
a re@@ proof enter@@ eth more into a wise man than an hundred stri@@ pes into a fo@@ ol .
let a bear ro@@ bbed of her whel@@ ps meet a man , rather than a fo@@ ol in his Fol@@ ly .
the beginning of stri@@ fe is as when one let@@ te@@ th out water : therefore leave off contention , before it be med@@ d@@ led with .
he that justi@@ fi@@ eth the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he that condem@@ net@@ h the just , even they both are ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore is there a price in the hand of a fo@@ ol to get wis@@ dom , seeing he hat@@ h no heart to it ?
a man vo@@ id of understanding stri@@ ket@@ h hands , and bec@@ o@@ me@@ th su@@ re@@ ty in the presence of his friend .
he that hat@@ h a fro@@ ward heart fin@@ de@@ th no good : and he that hat@@ h a per@@ verse ton@@ gue fal@@ le@@ th into mis@@ chief .
he that beg@@ et@@ te@@ th a fo@@ ol do@@ eth it to his sor@@ row : and the father of a fo@@ ol hat@@ h no joy .
a mer@@ ry heart do@@ eth good like a medicine : but a broken spirit dri@@ eth the b@@ ones .
a w@@ ic@@ ked man tak@@ eth a gift out of the bos@@ om to per@@ ver@@ t the ways of judgment .
wis@@ dom is before him that hat@@ h understanding ; but the eyes of a fo@@ ol are in the ends of the ear@@ th .
a fo@@ ol@@ ish son is a gri@@ ef to his father , and bit@@ ter@@ ness to her that b@@ are him .
he that hat@@ h knowledge spar@@ eth his words : and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit .
even a fo@@ ol , when he hol@@ de@@ th his peace , is counted wise : and he that shut@@ te@@ th his li@@ ps is es@@ te@@ emed a man of understanding .
when the w@@ ic@@ ked co@@ me@@ th , then co@@ me@@ th also con@@ temp@@ t , and with ig@@ nomin@@ y re@@ pro@@ ach .
it is not good to accept the person of the w@@ ic@@ ked , to overthrow the righ@@ te@@ ous in judgment .
a fo@@ ol 's m@@ outh is his destruction , and his li@@ ps are the sn@@ are of his sou@@ l .
the words of a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er are as wounds , and they go down into the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the bel@@ ly .
he also that is slo@@ th@@ ful in his work is brother to him that is a great was@@ ter .
the name of the Lord is a strong to@@ wer : the righ@@ te@@ ous run@@ net@@ h into it , and is safe .
the rich man 's wealth is his strong city , and as an high wall in his own conce@@ it .
before destruction the heart of man is ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and before honour is hum@@ il@@ ity .
he that answ@@ er@@ eth a matter before he he@@ aret@@ h it , it is Fol@@ ly and sh@@ ame un@@ to him .
the spirit of a man will sustain his in@@ fir@@ mity ; but a wounded spirit who can bear ?
he that is first in his own cause se@@ eme@@ th just ; but his neighbour co@@ me@@ th and sear@@ ch@@ eth him .
a brother off@@ ended is harder to be won than a strong city : and their conten@@ tions are like the bars of a castle .
a man 's bel@@ ly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his m@@ outh ; and with the increase of his li@@ ps shall he be filled .
death and life are in the power of the ton@@ gue : and they that love it shall eat the fruit there@@ of .
better is the poor that walk@@ eth in his integrity , than he that is per@@ verse in his li@@ ps , and is a fo@@ ol .
also , that the sou@@ l be without knowledge , it is not good ; and he that has@@ te@@ th with his feet sin@@ net@@ h .
a false witness shall not be un@@ punished , and he that speak@@ eth lies shall not escape .
many will in@@ treat the favour of the pr@@ ince : and every man is a friend to him that gi@@ vet@@ h gifts .
all the bre@@ th@@ ren of the poor do h@@ ate him : how much more do his friends go far from him ? he pursu@@ eth them with words , yet they are wan@@ ting to him .
he that get@@ te@@ th wis@@ dom lov@@ eth his own sou@@ l : he that keep@@ eth understanding shall find good .
the discre@@ tion of a man def@@ er@@ re@@ th his an@@ ger ; and it is his gl@@ ory to pass over a trans@@ gres@@ sion .
the king 's wr@@ ath is as the ro@@ aring of a lion ; but his favour is as dew upon the gr@@ ass .
a fo@@ ol@@ ish son is the cal@@ am@@ ity of his father : and the conten@@ tions of a wife are a contin@@ ual dropping .
he that keep@@ eth the comman@@ d@@ ment keep@@ eth his own sou@@ l ; but he that desp@@ is@@ eth his ways shall die .
he that hat@@ h p@@ ity upon the poor len@@ de@@ th un@@ to the Lord ; and that which he hat@@ h given will he pay him again .
Ch@@ as@@ ten TH@@ Y son while there is hope , and let not TH@@ Y sou@@ l spar@@ e for his cr@@ ying .
there are many devices in a man 's heart ; nevertheless the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that shall stand .
the desire of a man is his kin@@ d@@ ness : and a poor man is better than a li@@ ar .
the fear of the Lord ten@@ de@@ th to life : and he that hat@@ h it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with ev@@ il .
a slo@@ th@@ ful man hi@@ de@@ th his hand in his bos@@ om , and will not so much as bring it to his m@@ outh again .
Sm@@ ite a scor@@ ner , and the simple will be@@ w@@ are : and re@@ prove one that hat@@ h understanding , and he will understand knowledge .
he that was@@ te@@ th his father , and ch@@ as@@ eth away his mother , is a son that ca@@ us@@ eth sh@@ ame , and br@@ ing@@ eth re@@ pro@@ ach .
ce@@ ase , my son , to hear the in@@ struction that ca@@ us@@ eth to er@@ r from the words of knowledge .
the fear of a king is as the ro@@ aring of a lion : wh@@ os@@ o provok@@ eth him to an@@ ger sin@@ net@@ h against his own sou@@ l .
it is an honour for a man to ce@@ ase from stri@@ fe : but every fo@@ ol will be med@@ d@@ ling .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d will not plo@@ w by reason of the cold ; therefore shall he be@@ g in har@@ v@@ est , and have nothing .
coun@@ sel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .
a king that sit@@ te@@ th in the th@@ r@@ one of judgment sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth away all ev@@ il with his eyes .
di@@ vers we@@ ights , and di@@ vers measures , both of them are alike ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord .
the hearing e@@ ar , and the seeing eye , the Lord hat@@ h made even both of them .
love not sle@@ ep , lest th@@ ou come to poverty ; open th@@ ine eyes , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be satisfied with bread .
there is gold , and a multi@@ tude of ru@@ bies : but the li@@ ps of knowledge are a pre@@ ci@@ ous je@@ w@@ el .
he that go@@ eth about as a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts : therefore med@@ dle not with him that f@@ lat@@ ter@@ eth with his li@@ ps .
W@@ hos@@ o cur@@ set@@ h his father or his mother , his lam@@ p shall be put out in ob@@ sc@@ ure d@@ ark@@ ness .
an inher@@ it@@ ance may be gotten has@@ ti@@ ly at the beginning ; but the end there@@ of shall not be b@@ les@@ sed .
di@@ vers we@@ ights are an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord ; and a false balance is not good .
it is a sn@@ are to the man who dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th that which is hol@@ y , and after vows to make inquiry .
the spirit of man is the cand@@ le of the Lord , searching all the in@@ ward parts of the bel@@ ly .
the gl@@ ory of young men is their strength : and the beauty of old men is the gra@@ y head .
the blu@@ eness of a wo@@ und cleans@@ eth away ev@@ il : so do stri@@ pes the in@@ ward parts of the bel@@ ly .
the king 's heart is in the hand of the Lord , as the rivers of water : he tur@@ net@@ h it w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he will .
every way of a man is right in his own eyes : but the Lord pon@@ der@@ eth the hear@@ ts .
an high look , and a proud heart , and the p@@ low@@ ing of the w@@ ic@@ ked , is sin .
the th@@ ou@@ ghts of the dil@@ ig@@ ent tend only to plen@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; but of every one that is has@@ ty only to want .
the getting of treasures by a lying ton@@ gue is a van@@ ity tos@@ sed to and f@@ ro of them that seek death .
the way of man is fro@@ ward and st@@ range : but as for the p@@ ure , his work is right .
it is better to d@@ well in a cor@@ ner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than with a bra@@ w@@ ling woman in a wide house .
the sou@@ l of the w@@ ic@@ ked desi@@ re@@ th ev@@ il : his neighbour fin@@ de@@ th no favour in his eyes .
when the scor@@ ner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instruc@@ ted , he recei@@ vet@@ h knowledge .
the righ@@ te@@ ous man wis@@ ely consider@@ eth the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked : but God over@@ thro@@ w@@ eth the w@@ ic@@ ked for their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
W@@ hos@@ o stop@@ pet@@ h his e@@ ars at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
it is joy to the just to do judgment : but destruction shall be to the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
the man that w@@ ander@@ eth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the dead .
he that lov@@ eth pleas@@ ure shall be a poor man : he that lov@@ eth wine and oil shall not be rich .
the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be a ran@@ so@@ m for the righ@@ te@@ ous , and the trans@@ gres@@ sor for the u@@ pri@@ ght .
it is better to d@@ well in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , than with a conten@@ tious and an angry woman .
there is treasure to be desi@@ red and oil in the d@@ wel@@ ling of the wise ; but a fo@@ ol@@ ish man sp@@ en@@ de@@ th it up .
a wise man scal@@ eth the city of the m@@ igh@@ ty , and cas@@ te@@ th down the strength of the confidence there@@ of .
the sacrifice of the w@@ ic@@ ked is ab@@ omin@@ ation : how much more , when he br@@ ing@@ eth it with a w@@ ic@@ ked mind ?
a good name is rather to be chosen than great ri@@ ches , and lov@@ ing favour rather than silver and gold .
a pru@@ dent man fore@@ se@@ eth the ev@@ il , and hi@@ de@@ th himself : but the simple pass on , and are punished .
thor@@ ns and s@@ nar@@ es are in the way of the fro@@ ward : he that do@@ th keep his sou@@ l shall be far from them .
train up a child in the way he should go : and when he is old , he will not de@@ part from it .
he that so@@ w@@ eth in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall re@@ ap van@@ ity : and the ro@@ d of his an@@ ger shall fail .
he that hat@@ h a boun@@ ti@@ ful eye shall be b@@ les@@ sed ; for he gi@@ vet@@ h of his bread to the poor .
cast out the scor@@ ner , and contention shall go out ; ye@@ a , stri@@ fe and re@@ pro@@ ach shall ce@@ ase .
he that lov@@ eth pur@@ eness of heart , for the grace of his li@@ ps the king shall be his friend .
the eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge , and he over@@ thro@@ w@@ eth the words of the trans@@ gres@@ sor .
the m@@ outh of st@@ range women is a deep p@@ it : he that is ab@@ hor@@ red of the Lord shall fall there@@ in .
Fo@@ ol@@ ishness is bound in the heart of a child ; but the ro@@ d of correc@@ tion shall drive it far from him .
he that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h the poor to increase his ri@@ ches , and he that gi@@ vet@@ h to the rich , shall su@@ rely come to want .
bo@@ w down th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear the words of the wise , and apply th@@ ine heart un@@ to my knowledge .
for it is a pleas@@ ant thing if th@@ ou keep them within the@@ e ; they shall with@@ al be f@@ it@@ ted in TH@@ Y li@@ ps .
that TH@@ Y trust may be in the Lord , I have made known to the@@ e this day , even to the@@ e .
that I might make the@@ e know the certain@@ ty of the words of truth ; that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test answer the words of truth to them that send un@@ to the@@ e ?
for the Lord will p@@ lead their cause , and sp@@ oil the sou@@ l of those that sp@@ o@@ iled them .
make no friendship with an angry man ; and with a fur@@ ious man th@@ ou s@@ halt not go :
be not th@@ ou one of them that strike hands , or of them that are su@@ re@@ ties for debts .
if th@@ ou h@@ ast nothing to pay , why should he take away TH@@ Y bed from under the@@ e ?
Se@@ est th@@ ou a man dil@@ ig@@ ent in his business ? he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men .
when th@@ ou sit@@ test to eat with a ru@@ ler , consider dil@@ ig@@ ently what is before the@@ e :
and put a k@@ ni@@ fe to TH@@ Y thro@@ at , if th@@ ou be a man given to appe@@ ti@@ te .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou set th@@ ine eyes upon that which is not ? for ri@@ ches certainly make themselves w@@ ings ; they fly away as an e@@ ag@@ le toward heav@@ en .
eat th@@ ou not the bread of him that hat@@ h an ev@@ il eye , neither desire th@@ ou his da@@ in@@ ty me@@ ats :
for as he thin@@ ket@@ h in his heart , so is he : eat and drink , sa@@ ith he to the@@ e ; but his heart is not with the@@ e .
speak not in the e@@ ars of a fo@@ ol : for he will desp@@ ise the wis@@ dom of TH@@ Y words .
with@@ hold not correc@@ tion from the child : for if th@@ ou be@@ atest him with the ro@@ d , he shall not die .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt beat him with the ro@@ d , and s@@ halt deliver his sou@@ l from hell .
my son , if th@@ ine heart be wise , my heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice , even mine .
Ye@@ a , my re@@ ins shall re@@ jo@@ ice , when TH@@ Y li@@ ps speak right things .
let not th@@ ine heart en@@ v@@ y sin@@ ners : but be th@@ ou in the fear of the Lord all the day long .
for su@@ rely there is an end ; and th@@ ine expec@@ tation shall not be cut off .
hear th@@ ou , my son , and be wise , and guide th@@ ine heart in the way .
for the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d and the gl@@ ut@@ ton shall come to poverty : and dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess shall clo@@ the a man with ra@@ gs .
the father of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall greatly re@@ jo@@ ice : and he that beg@@ et@@ te@@ th a wise child shall have joy of him .
TH@@ Y father and TH@@ Y mother shall be glad , and she that b@@ are the@@ e shall re@@ jo@@ ice .
look not th@@ ou upon the wine when it is red , when it gi@@ vet@@ h his col@@ our in the c@@ up , when it mov@@ eth itself ar@@ ight .
Th@@ ine eyes shall be@@ hold st@@ range women , and th@@ ine heart shall ut@@ ter per@@ verse things .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as he that li@@ eth down in the mid@@ st of the sea , or as he that li@@ eth upon the top of a m@@ ast .
they have stric@@ ken me , s@@ halt th@@ ou say , and I was not si@@ ck ; they have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I aw@@ ake ? I will seek it yet again .
be not th@@ ou en@@ vi@@ ous against ev@@ il men , neither desire to be with them .
through wis@@ dom is an house buil@@ ded ; and by understanding it is established :
for by wise coun@@ sel th@@ ou s@@ halt make TH@@ Y war : and in multi@@ tude of coun@@ sel@@ lers there is safety .
he that dev@@ is@@ eth to do ev@@ il shall be called a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous person .
the thought of fo@@ ol@@ ishness is sin : and the scor@@ ner is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to men .
if th@@ ou for@@ bear to deliver them that are drawn un@@ to death , and those that are ready to be sla@@ in ;
my son , eat th@@ ou hon@@ ey , because it is good ; and the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , which is swe@@ et to TH@@ Y tas@@ te :
so shall the knowledge of wis@@ dom be un@@ to TH@@ Y sou@@ l : when th@@ ou h@@ ast found it , then there shall be a reward , and TH@@ Y expec@@ tation shall not be cut off .
for a just man fal@@ le@@ th seven times , and ris@@ eth up again : but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall fall into mis@@ chief .
re@@ jo@@ ice not when th@@ ine enemy fal@@ le@@ th , and let not th@@ ine heart be glad when he stumb@@ le@@ th :
L@@ est the Lord see it , and it disp@@ le@@ ase him , and he turn away his wr@@ ath from him .
fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of ev@@ il men , neither be th@@ ou en@@ vi@@ ous at the w@@ ic@@ ked ;
for there shall be no reward to the ev@@ il man ; the cand@@ le of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put out .
my son , fear th@@ ou the Lord and the king : and med@@ dle not with them that are given to change :
these things also belong to the wise . it is not good to have respect of persons in judgment .
he that sa@@ ith un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked , T@@ ho@@ u are righ@@ te@@ ous ; him shall the people cur@@ se , nations shall ab@@ h@@ or him :
but to them that re@@ bu@@ ke him shall be de@@ light , and a good b@@ les@@ sing shall come upon them .
prepare TH@@ Y work without , and make it fit for th@@ y@@ self in the field ; and afterwards build th@@ ine house .
be not a witness against TH@@ Y neighbour without cause ; and dec@@ e@@ ive not with TH@@ Y li@@ ps .
say not , I will do so to him as he hat@@ h done to me : I will ren@@ der to the man according to his work .
I went by the field of the slo@@ th@@ ful , and by the v@@ ine@@ yard of the man vo@@ id of understanding ;
and , lo , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns , and net@@ t@@ les had covered the face there@@ of , and the stone wall there@@ of was broken down .
then I saw , and considered it well : I looked upon it , and received in@@ struction .
it is the gl@@ ory of God to conce@@ al a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
the heav@@ en for he@@ ight , and the ear@@ th for dep@@ th , and the heart of kings is un@@ sear@@ cha@@ ble .
take away the dro@@ ss from the silver , and there shall come forth a ves@@ sel for the fin@@ er .
take away the w@@ ic@@ ked from before the king , and his th@@ r@@ one shall be established in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
put not forth th@@ y@@ self in the presence of the king , and stand not in the place of great men :
for better it is that it be said un@@ to the@@ e , C@@ ome up hi@@ ther ; than that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince whom th@@ ine eyes have seen .
go not forth has@@ ti@@ ly to strive , lest th@@ ou know not what to do in the end there@@ of , when TH@@ Y neighbour hat@@ h put the@@ e to sh@@ ame .
debate TH@@ Y cause with TH@@ Y neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
L@@ est he that he@@ aret@@ h it put the@@ e to sh@@ ame , and th@@ ine inf@@ am@@ y turn not away .
as the cold of snow in the time of har@@ v@@ est , so is a fa@@ ith@@ ful mes@@ sen@@ ger to them that send him : for he ref@@ res@@ het@@ h the sou@@ l of his mas@@ ters .
H@@ ast th@@ ou found hon@@ ey ? eat so much as is sufficient for the@@ e , lest th@@ ou be filled there@@ with , and v@@ om@@ it it .
withdraw TH@@ Y fo@@ ot from TH@@ Y neighbour 's house ; lest he be we@@ ary of the@@ e , and so h@@ ate the@@ e .
a man that be@@ aret@@ h false witness against his neighbour is a ma@@ ul , and a s@@ word , and a sharp ar@@ row .
confidence in an un@@ fa@@ ith@@ ful man in time of trouble is like a broken to@@ o@@ th , and a fo@@ ot out of joint .
as he that tak@@ eth away a gar@@ ment in cold weather , and as vin@@ eg@@ ar upon nit@@ re , so is he that sing@@ eth songs to an heavy heart .
if th@@ ine enemy be hun@@ gry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
for th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ ap co@@ als of fire upon his head , and the Lord shall reward the@@ e .
it is better to d@@ well in the cor@@ ner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than with a bra@@ w@@ ling woman and in a wide house .
it is not good to eat much hon@@ ey : so for men to search their own gl@@ ory is not gl@@ ory .
he that hat@@ h no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as the bird by w@@ and@@ ering , as the sw@@ allow by flying , so the cur@@ se ca@@ us@@ ele@@ ss shall not come .
a w@@ hip for the hor@@ se , a bri@@ dle for the ass , and a ro@@ d for the fo@@ ol 's back .
answer a fo@@ ol according to his Fol@@ ly , lest he be wise in his own conce@@ it .
the leg@@ s of the la@@ me are not equal : so is a par@@ able in the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols .
as he that bin@@ de@@ th a stone in a s@@ ling , so is he that gi@@ vet@@ h honour to a fo@@ ol .
as a Th@@ or@@ n go@@ eth up into the hand of a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d , so is a par@@ able in the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols .
as a do@@ g retur@@ net@@ h to his v@@ om@@ it , so a fo@@ ol retur@@ net@@ h to his Fol@@ ly .
Se@@ est th@@ ou a man wise in his own conce@@ it ? there is more hope of a fo@@ ol than of him .
the slo@@ th@@ ful hi@@ de@@ th his hand in his bos@@ om ; it gri@@ ev@@ eth him to bring it again to his m@@ outh .
he that pass@@ eth by , and med@@ d@@ le@@ th with stri@@ fe belonging not to him , is like one that tak@@ eth a do@@ g by the e@@ ars .
as a ma@@ d man who cas@@ te@@ th fire@@ brands , ar@@ ro@@ ws , and death ,
where no wood is , there the fire go@@ eth out : so where there is no tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er , the stri@@ fe ce@@ as@@ eth .
the words of a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er are as wounds , and they go down into the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the bel@@ ly .
when he speak@@ eth fair , believe him not : for there are seven ab@@ omin@@ ations in his heart .
W@@ hos@@ o dig@@ get@@ h a p@@ it shall fall there@@ in : and he that rol@@ le@@ th a stone , it will return upon him .
a lying ton@@ gue ha@@ te@@ th those that are aff@@ lic@@ ted by it ; and a f@@ lat@@ tering m@@ outh wor@@ ket@@ h ru@@ in .
bo@@ ast not th@@ y@@ self of to mor@@ row ; for th@@ ou know@@ est not what a day may bring forth .
let another man praise the@@ e , and not th@@ ine own m@@ outh ; a st@@ ran@@ ger , and not th@@ ine own li@@ ps .
wr@@ ath is cru@@ el , and an@@ ger is outra@@ ge@@ ous ; but who is able to stand before en@@ v@@ y ?
as a bird that w@@ ander@@ eth from her n@@ est , so is a man that w@@ ander@@ eth from his place .
o@@ in@@ tment and perf@@ ume re@@ jo@@ ice the heart : so do@@ th the swe@@ et@@ ness of a man 's friend by hear@@ ty coun@@ sel .
Th@@ ine own friend , and TH@@ Y father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into TH@@ Y brother 's house in the day of TH@@ Y cal@@ am@@ ity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
my son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that I may answer him that re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth me .
a pru@@ dent man fore@@ se@@ eth the ev@@ il , and hi@@ de@@ th himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
he that b@@ les@@ set@@ h his friend with a l@@ oud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a cur@@ se to him .
iron shar@@ pen@@ eth iron ; so a man shar@@ pen@@ eth the coun@@ tenance of his friend .
W@@ hos@@ o keep@@ eth the fi@@ g tree shall eat the fruit there@@ of : so he that w@@ ai@@ te@@ th on his master shall be honoured .
though th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest bra@@ y a fo@@ ol in a mort@@ ar among wheat with a p@@ est@@ le , yet will not his fo@@ ol@@ ishness de@@ part from him .
be th@@ ou dil@@ ig@@ ent to know the state of TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks , and look well to TH@@ Y her@@ ds .
for ri@@ ches are not for ever : and do@@ th the cro@@ wn en@@ dur@@ e to every generation ?
the ha@@ y appe@@ aret@@ h , and the tender gr@@ ass she@@ w@@ eth itself , and her@@ bs of the mountains are gathered .
the lam@@ bs are for TH@@ Y clo@@ thing , and the go@@ ats are the price of the field .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have go@@ ats ' milk enough for TH@@ Y food , for the food of TH@@ Y household , and for the maintenance for TH@@ Y ma@@ i@@ den@@ s .
for the trans@@ gres@@ sion of a land many are the pr@@ inces there@@ of : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state there@@ of shall be prol@@ on@@ ged .
a poor man that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h the poor is like a sweeping rain which le@@ av@@ eth no food .
they that for@@ sake the law praise the w@@ ic@@ ked : but such as keep the law conten@@ d with them .
ev@@ il men understand not judgment : but they that seek the Lord understand all things .
better is the poor that walk@@ eth in his u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , than he that is per@@ verse in his ways , though he be rich .
W@@ hos@@ o keep@@ eth the law is a wise son : but he that is a compan@@ ion of ri@@ ot@@ ous men sha@@ me@@ th his father .
he that by us@@ ury and un@@ just gain increas@@ eth his sub@@ stance , he shall gather it for him that will p@@ ity the poor .
he that tur@@ net@@ h away his e@@ ar from hearing the law , even his pray@@ er shall be ab@@ omin@@ ation .
W@@ hos@@ o ca@@ us@@ eth the righ@@ te@@ ous to go as@@ tra@@ y in an ev@@ il way , he shall fall himself into his own p@@ it : but the u@@ pri@@ ght shall have good things in possession .
the rich man is wise in his own conce@@ it ; but the poor that hat@@ h understanding sear@@ ch@@ eth him out .
when righ@@ te@@ ous men do re@@ jo@@ ice , there is great gl@@ ory : but when the w@@ ic@@ ked rise , a man is hidden .
he that cover@@ eth his sin@@ s shall not prosp@@ er : but wh@@ os@@ o conf@@ ess@@ eth and for@@ sak@@ eth them shall have mer@@ cy .
happy is the man that fear@@ eth al@@ way : but he that har@@ denet@@ h his heart shall fall into mis@@ chief .
as a ro@@ aring lion , and a ranging bear ; so is a w@@ ic@@ ked ru@@ ler over the poor people .
the pr@@ ince that wan@@ te@@ th understanding is also a great op@@ pres@@ sor : but he that ha@@ te@@ th c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness shall prol@@ ong his days .
a man that do@@ eth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the p@@ it ; let no man stay him .
W@@ hos@@ o walk@@ eth u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly shall be sav@@ ed : but he that is per@@ verse in his ways shall fall at once .
he that til@@ le@@ th his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that follow@@ eth after v@@ ain persons shall have poverty enough .
a fa@@ ith@@ ful man shall ab@@ ound with b@@ les@@ s@@ ings : but he that mak@@ eth has@@ te to be rich shall not be innocent .
he that has@@ te@@ th to be rich hat@@ h an ev@@ il eye , and consider@@ eth not that poverty shall come upon him .
he that re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that f@@ lat@@ ter@@ eth with the ton@@ gue .
W@@ hos@@ o rob@@ bet@@ h his father or his mother , and sa@@ ith , It is no trans@@ gres@@ sion ; the same is the compan@@ ion of a destro@@ yer .
he that is of a proud heart s@@ tir@@ re@@ th up stri@@ fe : but he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th his trust in the Lord shall be made f@@ at .
he that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in his own heart is a fo@@ ol : but wh@@ os@@ o walk@@ eth wis@@ ely , he shall be delivered .
he that gi@@ vet@@ h un@@ to the poor shall not lack : but he that hi@@ de@@ th his eyes shall have many a cur@@ se .
he , that being often re@@ proved har@@ denet@@ h his nec@@ k , shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be destroyed , and that without re@@ medy .
when the righ@@ te@@ ous are in authority , the people re@@ jo@@ ice : but when the w@@ ic@@ ked be@@ aret@@ h rule , the people mour@@ n .
W@@ hos@@ o lov@@ eth wis@@ dom re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth his father : but he that keep@@ eth company with har@@ lots sp@@ en@@ de@@ th his sub@@ stance .
in the trans@@ gres@@ sion of an ev@@ il man there is a sn@@ are : but the righ@@ te@@ ous do@@ th sing and re@@ jo@@ ice .
S@@ cor@@ n@@ ful men bring a city into a sn@@ are : but wise men turn away wr@@ ath .
if a wise man conten@@ de@@ th with a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , whether he ra@@ ge or la@@ ug@@ h , there is no rest .
a fo@@ ol ut@@ ter@@ eth all his mind : but a wise man keep@@ eth it in ti@@ ll afterwards .
the king that fa@@ ith@@ fully jud@@ get@@ h the poor , his th@@ r@@ one shall be established for ever .
the ro@@ d and re@@ proof give wis@@ dom : but a child left to himself br@@ ing@@ eth his mother to sh@@ ame .
correct TH@@ Y son , and he shall give the@@ e rest ; ye@@ a , he shall give de@@ light un@@ to TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
a ser@@ vant will not be correc@@ ted by words : for though he understand he will not answer .
Se@@ est th@@ ou a man that is has@@ ty in his words ? there is more hope of a fo@@ ol than of him .
he that de@@ lic@@ ately br@@ ing@@ eth up his ser@@ vant from a child shall have him become his son at the length .
a man 's pride shall bring him low : but honour shall up@@ hold the hum@@ ble in spirit .
W@@ hos@@ o is partner with a th@@ i@@ ef ha@@ te@@ th his own sou@@ l : he he@@ aret@@ h cur@@ sing , and be@@ wr@@ ay@@ eth it not .
the fear of man br@@ ing@@ eth a sn@@ are : but wh@@ os@@ o p@@ ut@@ te@@ th his trust in the Lord shall be safe .
an un@@ just man is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the just : and he that is u@@ pri@@ ght in the way is ab@@ omin@@ ation to the w@@ ic@@ ked .
su@@ rely I am more bru@@ tish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man .
every word of God is p@@ ure : he is a shield un@@ to them that put their trust in him .
L@@ est I be full , and deny the@@ e , and say , Wh@@ o is the Lord ? or lest I be poor , and ste@@ al , and take the name of my God in v@@ ain .
there is a generation that are p@@ ure in their own eyes , and yet is not was@@ hed from their fil@@ th@@ iness .
there is a generation , whose te@@ eth are as s@@ words , and their j@@ a@@ w te@@ eth as k@@ ni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from off the ear@@ th , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
the hor@@ sele@@ ach hat@@ h two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , cr@@ ying , Gi@@ ve , give . there are three things that are never satisfied , ye@@ a , four things say not , It is enough :
the grave ; and the bar@@ ren w@@ om@@ b ; the ear@@ th that is not filled with water ; and the fire that sa@@ ith not , It is enough .
the eye that mo@@ c@@ ket@@ h at his father , and desp@@ is@@ eth to obe@@ y his mother , the ra@@ ven@@ s of the val@@ ley shall pick it out , and the young e@@ ag@@ les shall eat it .
there be three things which are too won@@ der@@ ful for me , ye@@ a , four which I know not :
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ id .
for a ser@@ vant when he re@@ ig@@ net@@ h ; and a fo@@ ol when he is filled with meat ;
for an odi@@ ous woman when she is married ; and an hand@@ ma@@ id that is he@@ ir to her mist@@ ress .
the ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ;
the loc@@ ust@@ s have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ;
a gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und ; an he go@@ at also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up .
if th@@ ou h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly in lifting up th@@ y@@ self , or if th@@ ou h@@ ast thought ev@@ il , lay th@@ ine hand upon TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
su@@ rely the chur@@ ning of milk br@@ ing@@ eth forth but@@ ter , and the wr@@ inging of the n@@ ose br@@ ing@@ eth forth blood : so the forcing of wr@@ ath br@@ ing@@ eth forth stri@@ fe .
what , my son ? and what , the son of my w@@ om@@ b ? and what , the son of my vows ?
give not TH@@ Y strength un@@ to women , nor TH@@ Y ways to that which destro@@ yet@@ h kings .
L@@ est they drink , and forget the law , and per@@ ver@@ t the judgment of any of the aff@@ lic@@ ted .
give strong drink un@@ to him that is ready to per@@ ish , and wine un@@ to those that be of heavy hear@@ ts .
open TH@@ Y m@@ outh for the dum@@ b in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
the heart of her husband do@@ th saf@@ ely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of sp@@ oil .
she is like the mer@@ chan@@ ts ' ships ; she br@@ ing@@ eth her food from af@@ ar .
she ris@@ eth also while it is yet night , and gi@@ vet@@ h meat to her household , and a portion to her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s .
she consider@@ eth a field , and bu@@ yet@@ h it : with the fruit of her hands she plan@@ te@@ th a v@@ ine@@ yard .
she perce@@ i@@ vet@@ h that her mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise is good : her cand@@ le go@@ eth not out by night .
she lay@@ eth her hands to the sp@@ in@@ dle , and her hands hold the dist@@ aff .
she stret@@ ch@@ eth out her hand to the poor ; ye@@ a , she reac@@ het@@ h forth her hands to the ne@@ edy .
she is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clo@@ th@@ ed with scar@@ let .
her husband is known in the gates , when he sit@@ te@@ th among the el@@ ders of the land .
she mak@@ eth fine lin@@ en , and sel@@ le@@ th it ; and deliver@@ eth gir@@ d@@ les un@@ to the mer@@ chan@@ t .
strength and honour are her clo@@ thing ; and she shall re@@ jo@@ ice in time to come .
she open@@ eth her m@@ outh with wis@@ dom ; and in her ton@@ gue is the law of kin@@ d@@ ness .
she lo@@ ok@@ eth well to the ways of her household , and e@@ ate@@ th not the bread of id@@ len@@ ess .
her children arise up , and call her b@@ les@@ sed ; her husband also , and he pra@@ is@@ eth her .
favour is dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful , and beauty is v@@ ain : but a woman that fear@@ eth the Lord , she shall be praised .
give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
the words of the pre@@ acher , the son of David , king in Jer@@ usalem .
what profit hat@@ h a man of all his labour which he tak@@ eth under the sun ?
the sun also ar@@ is@@ eth , and the sun go@@ eth down , and has@@ te@@ th to his place where he ar@@ ose .
the wind go@@ eth toward the south , and tur@@ net@@ h about un@@ to the north ; it wh@@ ir@@ le@@ th about continu@@ ally , and the wind retur@@ net@@ h again according to his cir@@ cu@@ its .
all the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; un@@ to the place from wh@@ ence the rivers come , th@@ ither they return again .
all things are full of labour ; man can@@ not ut@@ ter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the e@@ ar filled with hearing .
the thing that hat@@ h been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of former things ; neither shall there be any re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wis@@ dom concerning all things that are done under heav@@ en : this sor@@ e trav@@ ail hat@@ h God given to the sons of man to be exerc@@ ised there@@ with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , be@@ hold , all is van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
that which is cro@@ oked can@@ not be made stra@@ ight : and that which is wan@@ ting can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed .
I made me po@@ ols of water , to water there@@ with the wood that br@@ ing@@ eth forth trees :
I got me servants and ma@@ i@@ den@@ s , and had servants born in my house ; also I had great pos@@ sessions of great and small c@@ attle above all that were in Jer@@ usalem before me :
so I was great , and increased more than all that were before me in Jer@@ usalem : also my wis@@ dom remained with me .
and I turned myself to be@@ hold wis@@ dom , and mad@@ ness , and Fol@@ ly : for what can the man do that co@@ me@@ th after the king ? even that which hat@@ h been already done .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head ; but the fo@@ ol walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness : and I myself perceived also that one event happen@@ eth to them all .
therefore I ha@@ ted life ; because the work that is w@@ rought under the sun is gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to me : for all is van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
Ye@@ a , I ha@@ ted all my labour which I had taken under the sun : because I should leave it un@@ to the man that shall be after me .
and who know@@ eth whether he shall be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour where@@ in I have la@@ b@@ oured , and where@@ in I have she@@ wed myself wise under the sun . this is also van@@ ity .
therefore I went about to cause my heart to desp@@ air of all the labour which I took under the sun .
for what hat@@ h man of all his labour , and of the v@@ ex@@ ation of his heart , where@@ in he hat@@ h la@@ b@@ oured under the sun ?
for all his days are sor@@ ro@@ ws , and his trav@@ ail gri@@ ef ; ye@@ a , his heart tak@@ eth not rest in the night . this is also van@@ ity .
to every thing there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heav@@ en :
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to p@@ lu@@ ck up that which is plan@@ ted ;
a time to kill , and a time to he@@ al ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to em@@ br@@ ace , and a time to refrain from embrac@@ ing ;
a time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to ren@@ d , and a time to se@@ w ; a time to keep sil@@ ence , and a time to speak ;
I have seen the trav@@ ail , which God hat@@ h given to the sons of men to be exerc@@ ised in it .
he hat@@ h made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hat@@ h set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God mak@@ eth from the beginning to the end .
I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to re@@ jo@@ ice , and to do good in his life .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God .
and moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there ; and the place of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity was there .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manif@@ est them , and that they might see that they themselves are be@@ asts .
all go un@@ to one place ; all are of the d@@ ust , and all turn to d@@ ust again .
who know@@ eth the spirit of man that go@@ eth up@@ ward , and the spirit of the be@@ ast that go@@ eth down@@ ward to the ear@@ th ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive .
Ye@@ a , better is he than both they , which hat@@ h not yet been , who hat@@ h not seen the ev@@ il work that is done under the sun .
again , I considered all trav@@ ail , and every right work , that for this a man is en@@ vi@@ ed of his neighbour . this is also van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
the fo@@ ol fol@@ de@@ th his hands together , and e@@ ate@@ th his own f@@ les@@ h .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but wo@@ e to him that is alone when he fal@@ le@@ th ; for he hat@@ h not another to help him up .
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and fo@@ ol@@ ish king , who will no more be ad@@ mon@@ ished .
for out of prison he co@@ me@@ th to reign ; whereas also he that is born in his k@@ ing@@ dom bec@@ o@@ me@@ th poor .
I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
keep TH@@ Y fo@@ ot when th@@ ou go@@ est to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fo@@ ols : for they consider not that they do ev@@ il .
be not ras@@ h with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and let not th@@ ine heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter any thing before God : for God is in heav@@ en , and th@@ ou upon ear@@ th : therefore let TH@@ Y words be few .
for a dream co@@ me@@ th through the multi@@ tude of business ; and a fo@@ ol 's voice is known by multi@@ tude of words .
when th@@ ou vo@@ west a vo@@ w un@@ to God , def@@ er not to pay it ; for he hat@@ h no pleas@@ ure in fo@@ ols : pay that which th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed .
better is it that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not vo@@ w , than that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest vo@@ w and not pay .
suffer not TH@@ Y m@@ outh to cause TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h to sin ; neither say th@@ ou before the an@@ gel , that it was an er@@ ror : where@@ fore should God be angry at TH@@ Y voice , and destroy the work of th@@ ine hands ?
moreover the profit of the ear@@ th is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
he that lov@@ eth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that lov@@ eth ab@@ und@@ ance with increase : this is also van@@ ity .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners there@@ of , saving the be@@ holding of them with their eyes ?
the sle@@ ep of a la@@ bour@@ ing man is swe@@ et , whether he eat little or much : but the ab@@ und@@ ance of the rich will not suffer him to sle@@ ep .
as he came forth of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
and this also is a sor@@ e ev@@ il , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hat@@ h he that hat@@ h la@@ b@@ oured for the wind ?
all his days also he e@@ ate@@ th in d@@ ark@@ ness , and he hat@@ h much sor@@ row and wr@@ ath with his si@@ ck@@ ness .
there is an ev@@ il which I have seen under the sun , and it is common among men :
all the labour of man is for his m@@ outh , and yet the appe@@ ti@@ te is not filled .
for what hat@@ h the wise more than the fo@@ ol ? what hat@@ h the poor , that know@@ eth to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the w@@ and@@ ering of the desire : this is also van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
that which hat@@ h been is named already , and it is known that it is man : neither may he conten@@ d with him that is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than he .
a good name is better than pre@@ ci@@ ous o@@ in@@ tment ; and the day of death than the day of one 's birth .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
sor@@ row is better than la@@ ughter : for by the sad@@ ness of the coun@@ tenance the heart is made better .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fo@@ ols is in the house of mir@@ th .
it is better to hear the re@@ bu@@ ke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fo@@ ols .
for as the crack@@ ling of thor@@ ns under a po@@ t , so is the la@@ ughter of the fo@@ ol : this also is van@@ ity .
su@@ rely op@@ pression mak@@ eth a wise man ma@@ d ; and a gift destro@@ yet@@ h the heart .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning there@@ of : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
be not has@@ ty in TH@@ Y spirit to be angry : for an@@ ger res@@ te@@ th in the bos@@ om of fo@@ ols .
say not th@@ ou , What is the cause that the former days were better than these ? for th@@ ou dost not inqu@@ ire wis@@ ely concerning this .
wis@@ dom is good with an inher@@ it@@ ance : and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
for wis@@ dom is a defence , and money is a defence : but the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of knowledge is , that wis@@ dom gi@@ vet@@ h life to them that have it .
consider the work of God : for who can make that stra@@ ight , which he hat@@ h made cro@@ oked ?
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , but in the day of ad@@ versity consider : God also hat@@ h set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
all things have I seen in the days of my van@@ ity : there is a just man that per@@ is@@ het@@ h in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man that prol@@ on@@ get@@ h his life in his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
be not over much w@@ ic@@ ked , neither be th@@ ou fo@@ ol@@ ish : why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou die before TH@@ Y time ?
it is good that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take hold of this ; ye@@ a , also from this withdraw not th@@ ine hand : for he that fear@@ eth God shall come forth of them all .
also take no heed un@@ to all words that are spoken ; lest th@@ ou hear TH@@ Y ser@@ vant cur@@ se the@@ e :
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wis@@ dom , and the reason of things , and to know the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Fol@@ ly , even of fo@@ ol@@ ishness and mad@@ ness :
which yet my sou@@ l seek@@ eth , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
who is as the wise man ? and who know@@ eth the interpre@@ tation of a thing ? a man 's wis@@ dom mak@@ eth his face to sh@@ ine , and the bol@@ d@@ ness of his face shall be changed .
I coun@@ sel the@@ e to keep the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
be not has@@ ty to go out of his sight : stand not in an ev@@ il thing ; for he do@@ eth wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever pleas@@ eth him .
where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say un@@ to him , What do@@ est th@@ ou ?
W@@ hos@@ o keep@@ eth the comman@@ d@@ ment shall feel no ev@@ il thing : and a wise man 's heart dis@@ cer@@ net@@ h both time and judgment .
because to every purpose there is time and judgment , therefore the mis@@ ery of man is great upon him .
for he know@@ eth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when it shall be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my heart un@@ to every work that is done under the sun : there is a time where@@ in one man ru@@ le@@ th over another to his own hurt .
and so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the hol@@ y , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also van@@ ity .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
though a sin@@ ner do ev@@ il an hundred times , and his days be prol@@ on@@ ged , yet su@@ rely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the w@@ ic@@ ked , neither shall he prol@@ ong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he fear@@ eth not before God .
when I applied mine heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done upon the ear@@ th : ( for also there is that neither day nor night se@@ eth sle@@ ep with his eyes : )
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope : for a living do@@ g is better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y , is now per@@ ished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
go TH@@ Y way , eat TH@@ Y bread with joy , and drink TH@@ Y wine with a mer@@ ry heart ; for God now accep@@ te@@ th TH@@ Y works .
let TH@@ Y gar@@ ments be always white ; and let TH@@ Y head lack no o@@ in@@ tment .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , and built great bul@@ war@@ ks against it :
now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wis@@ dom delivered the city ; yet no man remember@@ ed that same poor man .
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ru@@ le@@ th among fo@@ ols .
dead f@@ lies cause the o@@ in@@ tment of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ ary to send forth a st@@ in@@ king sav@@ our : so do@@ th a little Fol@@ ly him that is in reputation for wis@@ dom and honour .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand ; but a fo@@ ol 's heart at his left .
Ye@@ a also , when he that is a fo@@ ol walk@@ eth by the way , his wis@@ dom fail@@ eth him , and he sa@@ ith to every one that he is a fo@@ ol .
if the spirit of the ru@@ ler rise up against the@@ e , leave not TH@@ Y place ; for yi@@ el@@ ding p@@ ac@@ i@@ fi@@ eth great offences .
there is an ev@@ il which I have seen under the sun , as an er@@ ror which proce@@ ede@@ th from the ru@@ ler :
he that dig@@ get@@ h a p@@ it shall fall into it ; and wh@@ os@@ o break@@ eth an h@@ edge , a ser@@ p@@ ent shall bi@@ te him .
W@@ hos@@ o remov@@ eth stones shall be hurt there@@ with ; and he that cle@@ av@@ eth wood shall be endangered there@@ by .
if the iron be b@@ lun@@ t , and he do not wh@@ et the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wis@@ dom is profitable to direct .
the words of a wise man 's m@@ outh are gr@@ ac@@ ious ; but the li@@ ps of a fo@@ ol will sw@@ allow up himself .
the beginning of the words of his m@@ outh is fo@@ ol@@ ishness : and the end of his talk is mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous mad@@ ness .
a fo@@ ol also is full of words : a man can@@ not tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
the labour of the fo@@ ol@@ ish we@@ ar@@ i@@ eth every one of them , because he know@@ eth not how to go to the city .
Wo@@ e to the@@ e , O land , when TH@@ Y king is a child , and TH@@ Y pr@@ inces eat in the morning !
b@@ les@@ sed art th@@ ou , O land , when TH@@ Y king is the son of no@@ bles , and TH@@ Y pr@@ inces eat in due season , for strength , and not for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness !
by much slo@@ th@@ ful@@ ness the building dec@@ ay@@ eth ; and through id@@ len@@ ess of the hands the house dro@@ p@@ pet@@ h through .
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for th@@ ou know@@ est not what ev@@ il shall be upon the ear@@ th .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the ear@@ th : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fal@@ le@@ th , there it shall be .
he that obser@@ vet@@ h the wind shall not so@@ w ; and he that regar@@ de@@ th the cl@@ ou@@ ds shall not re@@ ap .
as th@@ ou know@@ est not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the b@@ ones do grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her that is with child : even so th@@ ou know@@ est not the works of God who mak@@ eth all .
in the morning so@@ w TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and in the evening with@@ hold not th@@ ine hand : for th@@ ou know@@ est not whether shall prosp@@ er , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
truly the light is swe@@ et , and a pleas@@ ant thing it is for the eyes to be@@ hold the sun :
but if a man live many years , and re@@ jo@@ ice in them all ; yet let him remember the days of d@@ ark@@ ness ; for they shall be many . all that co@@ me@@ th is van@@ ity .
therefore remove sor@@ row from TH@@ Y heart , and put away ev@@ il from TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h : for ch@@ ild@@ hood and youth are van@@ ity .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of musi@@ ck shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cor@@ d be lo@@ os@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l be broken , or the pit@@ cher be broken at the fo@@ un@@ tain , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n .
then shall the d@@ ust return to the ear@@ th as it was : and the spirit shall return un@@ to God who gave it .
and moreover , because the pre@@ acher was wise , he still ta@@ ught the people knowledge ; ye@@ a , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many Pro@@ ver@@ bs .
the pre@@ acher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was u@@ pri@@ ght , even words of truth .
the words of the wise are as go@@ ads , and as n@@ ails fas@@ tened by the mas@@ ters of assemb@@ lies , which are given from one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and further , by these , my son , be ad@@ mon@@ ished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a we@@ ar@@ iness of the f@@ les@@ h .
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear God , and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments : for this is the whole duty of man .
for God shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good , or whether it be ev@@ il .
the song of songs , which is Solomon 's .
let him k@@ is@@ s me with the k@@ is@@ ses of his m@@ outh : for TH@@ Y love is better than wine .
because of the sav@@ our of TH@@ Y good o@@ in@@ tments TH@@ Y name is as o@@ in@@ tment p@@ oured forth , therefore do the vir@@ g@@ ins love the@@ e .
if th@@ ou know not , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women , go TH@@ Y way forth by the foot@@ steps of the flock , and fe@@ ed TH@@ Y kids bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
I have compared the@@ e , O my love , to a company of hor@@ ses in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's char@@ i@@ ots .
TH@@ Y che@@ eks are co@@ mely with ro@@ ws of je@@ wel@@ s , TH@@ Y nec@@ k with cha@@ ins of gold .
while the king sit@@ te@@ th at his table , my sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard sen@@ de@@ th forth the s@@ me@@ ll there@@ of .
a bun@@ dle of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h is my wel@@ l@@ bel@@ ov@@ ed un@@ to me ; he shall lie all night bet@@ wi@@ xt my bre@@ asts .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is un@@ to me as a cl@@ us@@ ter of camp@@ h@@ ire in the v@@ ine@@ yards of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou art fair , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , ye@@ a , pleas@@ ant : also our bed is green .
I am the rose of Shar@@ on , and the L@@ ily of the val@@ ley@@ s .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , and his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
his left hand is under my head , and his right hand do@@ th em@@ br@@ ace me .
I charge you , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem , by the ro@@ es , and by the hin@@ ds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor aw@@ ake my love , ti@@ ll he ple@@ ase .
the voice of my bel@@ ov@@ ed ! be@@ hold , he co@@ me@@ th le@@ ap@@ ing upon the mountains , sk@@ ip@@ ping upon the hil@@ ls .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t : be@@ hold , he stan@@ de@@ th behind our wall , he lo@@ ok@@ eth forth at the windows , she@@ wing himself through the lat@@ tice .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed sp@@ ake , and said un@@ to me , R@@ ise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
for , lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone ;
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the tur@@ tle is heard in our land ;
the fi@@ g tree p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth her green fig@@ s , and the v@@ ines with the tender gra@@ pe give a good s@@ me@@ ll . arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
take us the fo@@ x@@ es , the little fo@@ x@@ es , that sp@@ oil the v@@ ines : for our v@@ ines have tender grap@@ es .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , turn , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , and be th@@ ou like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t upon the mountains of Be@@ ther .
by night on my bed I sought him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
the watch@@ men that go about the city found me : to whom I said , saw ye him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth ?
I charge you , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem , by the ro@@ es , and by the hin@@ ds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor aw@@ ake my love , ti@@ ll he ple@@ ase .
who is this that co@@ me@@ th out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like pil@@ lars of smoke , per@@ fu@@ med with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , with all pow@@ ders of the mer@@ chan@@ t ?
be@@ hold his bed , which is Solomon 's ; thre@@ es@@ core val@@ i@@ ant men are about it , of the val@@ i@@ ant of Israel .
they all hold s@@ words , being expert in war : every man hat@@ h his s@@ word upon his th@@ igh because of fear in the night .
he made the pil@@ lars there@@ of of silver , the bottom there@@ of of gold , the covering of it of pur@@ ple , the mid@@ st there@@ of being paved with love , for the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
go forth , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and be@@ hold king Solomon with the cro@@ wn where@@ with his mother crow@@ ned him in the day of his es@@ po@@ us@@ als , and in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart .
TH@@ Y te@@ eth are like a flock of she@@ ep that are even shor@@ n , which came up from the w@@ ashing ; where@@ of every one bear tw@@ ins , and none is bar@@ ren among them .
TH@@ Y li@@ ps are like a thre@@ ad of scar@@ let , and TH@@ Y speech is co@@ mely : TH@@ Y temp@@ les are like a piece of a po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate within TH@@ Y loc@@ ks .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will get me to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart , my sister , my sp@@ o@@ use ; th@@ ou h@@ ast ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart with one of th@@ ine eyes , with one chain of TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
how fair is TH@@ Y love , my sister , my sp@@ o@@ use ! how much better is TH@@ Y love than wine ! and the s@@ me@@ ll of th@@ ine o@@ in@@ tments than all sp@@ ices !
TH@@ Y li@@ ps , O my sp@@ o@@ use , drop as the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b : hon@@ ey and milk are under TH@@ Y ton@@ gue ; and the s@@ me@@ ll of TH@@ Y gar@@ ments is like the s@@ me@@ ll of Lebanon .
TH@@ Y plants are an or@@ char@@ d of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , with pleas@@ ant fru@@ its ; camp@@ h@@ ire , with sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard ,
I have put off my co@@ at ; how shall I put it on ? I have was@@ hed my feet ; how shall I def@@ ile them ?
my bel@@ ov@@ ed put in his hand by the hol@@ e of the door , and my bo@@ wel@@ s were moved for him .
I rose up to open to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; and my hands dropped with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and my fin@@ gers with swe@@ et s@@ mel@@ ling m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , upon the hand@@ les of the lock .
the watch@@ men that went about the city found me , they smo@@ te me , they wounded me ; the ke@@ epers of the walls took away my ve@@ il from me .
I charge you , O da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem , if ye find my bel@@ ov@@ ed , that ye tell him , that I am si@@ ck of love .
what is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed more than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women ? what is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed more than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , that th@@ ou dost so charge us ?
his head is as the most fine gold , his loc@@ ks are b@@ ush@@ y , and black as a ra@@ ven .
his eyes are as the eyes of d@@ ov@@ es by the rivers of waters , was@@ hed with milk , and f@@ it@@ ly set .
his hands are as gold r@@ ings set with the ber@@ y@@ l : his bel@@ ly is as bright Iv@@ ory over@@ laid with sap@@ p@@ hi@@ res .
his m@@ outh is most swe@@ et : ye@@ a , he is altogether lov@@ ely . this is my bel@@ ov@@ ed , and this is my friend , O da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
W@@ hi@@ ther is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed gone , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women ? w@@ hi@@ ther is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed turned aside ? that we may seek him with the@@ e .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is gone down into his gar@@ den , to the beds of sp@@ ices , to fe@@ ed in the gar@@ den@@ s , and to gather l@@ ilies .
turn away th@@ ine eyes from me , for they have overcome me : TH@@ Y ha@@ ir is as a flock of go@@ ats that appear from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
TH@@ Y te@@ eth are as a flock of she@@ ep which go up from the w@@ ashing , where@@ of every one be@@ aret@@ h tw@@ ins , and there is not one bar@@ ren among them .
as a piece of a po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate are TH@@ Y temp@@ les within TH@@ Y loc@@ ks .
I went down into the gar@@ den of n@@ u@@ ts to see the fru@@ its of the val@@ ley , and to see whether the v@@ ine flo@@ ur@@ ished , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates bud@@ ded .
how beautiful are TH@@ Y feet with sho@@ es , O pr@@ ince 's daughter ! the join@@ ts of TH@@ Y th@@ igh@@ s are like je@@ wel@@ s , the work of the hands of a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man .
TH@@ Y nav@@ el is like a round go@@ b@@ let , which wan@@ te@@ th not liqu@@ or : TH@@ Y bel@@ ly is like an he@@ ap of wheat set about with l@@ ilies .
TH@@ Y nec@@ k is as a to@@ wer of Iv@@ ory ; th@@ ine eyes like the fis@@ h@@ po@@ ols in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , by the gate of B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ rab@@ bi@@ m : TH@@ Y n@@ ose is as the to@@ wer of Lebanon which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Th@@ ine head upon the@@ e is like Car@@ mel , and the ha@@ ir of th@@ ine head like pur@@ ple ; the king is held in the gal@@ ler@@ ies .
this TH@@ Y stat@@ ure is like to a pal@@ m tree , and TH@@ Y bre@@ asts to clu@@ sters of grap@@ es .
and the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh like the best wine for my bel@@ ov@@ ed , that go@@ eth down swe@@ et@@ ly , causing the li@@ ps of those that are as@@ le@@ ep to speak .
come , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , let us go forth into the field ; let us lo@@ dge in the villages .
let us get up early to the v@@ ine@@ yards ; let us see if the v@@ ine flo@@ ur@@ ish , whether the tender gra@@ pe appear , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates bu@@ d forth : there will I give the@@ e my lov@@ es .
the mand@@ rak@@ es give a s@@ me@@ ll , and at our gates are all manner of pleas@@ ant fru@@ its , new and old , which I have laid up for the@@ e , O my bel@@ ov@@ ed .
O that th@@ ou w@@ ert as my brother , that suc@@ ked the bre@@ asts of my mother ! when I should find the@@ e without , I would k@@ is@@ s the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I should not be desp@@ ised .
I would lead the@@ e , and bring the@@ e into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me : I would cause the@@ e to drink of sp@@ ic@@ ed wine of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
his left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should em@@ br@@ ace me .
who is this that co@@ me@@ th up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , le@@ an@@ ing upon her bel@@ ov@@ ed ? I raised the@@ e up under the app@@ le tree : there TH@@ Y mother brought the@@ e forth : there she brought the@@ e forth that b@@ are the@@ e .
many waters can@@ not qu@@ en@@ ch love , neither can the floods dro@@ wn it : if a man would give all the sub@@ stance of his house for love , it would ut@@ ter@@ ly be con@@ tem@@ ned .
we have a little sister , and she hat@@ h no bre@@ asts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
Solomon had a v@@ ine@@ yard at Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ham@@ on ; he let out the v@@ ine@@ yard un@@ to ke@@ epers ; every one for the fruit there@@ of was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
my v@@ ine@@ yard , which is mine , is before me : th@@ ou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit there@@ of two hundred .
make has@@ te , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , and be th@@ ou like to a ro@@ e or to a young har@@ t upon the mountains of sp@@ ices .
the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , which he saw concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ h s@@ inf@@ ul nation , a people la@@ den with in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , a se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , children that are cor@@ rup@@ ters : they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel un@@ to an@@ ger , they are gone away back@@ ward .
why should ye be stric@@ ken any more ? ye will revol@@ t more and more : the whole head is si@@ ck , and the whole heart fa@@ int .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even un@@ to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it ; but wounds , and bru@@ ises , and p@@ ut@@ rif@@ ying so@@ res : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither m@@ ol@@ lified with o@@ in@@ tment .
your country is de@@ so@@ late , your cities are burned with fire : your land , st@@ ran@@ gers dev@@ our it in your presence , and it is de@@ so@@ late , as over@@ thrown by st@@ ran@@ gers .
and the daughter of Z@@ ion is left as a cot@@ t@@ age in a v@@ ine@@ yard , as a lo@@ dge in a gar@@ den of c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , as a bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed city .
except the Lord of hosts had left un@@ to us a very small re@@ mn@@ ant , we should have been as So@@ dom , and we should have been like un@@ to G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h .
hear the word of the Lord , ye rul@@ ers of So@@ dom ; give e@@ ar un@@ to the law of our God , ye people of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h .
when ye come to appear before me , who hat@@ h required this at your hand , to tre@@ ad my courts ?
bring no more v@@ ain ob@@ lations ; incen@@ se is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to me ; the new mo@@ ons and sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , the calling of assemb@@ lies , I can@@ not away with ; it is in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , even the so@@ lem@@ n meeting .
your new mo@@ ons and your appointed fe@@ asts my sou@@ l ha@@ te@@ th : they are a trouble un@@ to me ; I am we@@ ary to bear them .
was@@ h you , make you clean ; put away the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings from before mine eyes ; ce@@ ase to do ev@@ il ;
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be dev@@ oured with the s@@ word : for the m@@ outh of the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
how is the fa@@ ith@@ ful city become an har@@ lot ! it was full of judgment ; righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness lo@@ d@@ ged in it ; but now mur@@ der@@ ers .
TH@@ Y pr@@ inces are rebel@@ li@@ ous , and compan@@ ions of th@@ i@@ ev@@ es : every one lov@@ eth gifts , and follow@@ eth after re@@ wards : they judge not the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither do@@ th the cause of the wi@@ dow come un@@ to them .
therefore sa@@ ith the Lord , the Lord of hosts , the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Israel , A@@ h , I will ease me of mine ad@@ vers@@ aries , and av@@ en@@ ge me of mine enem@@ ies :
and I will turn my hand upon the@@ e , and pu@@ rely pur@@ ge away TH@@ Y dro@@ ss , and take away all TH@@ Y tin :
and I will restore TH@@ Y judges as at the first , and TH@@ Y coun@@ sel@@ lers as at the beginning : after@@ ward th@@ ou s@@ halt be called , The city of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , the fa@@ ith@@ ful city .
and the destruction of the trans@@ gres@@ sors and of the sin@@ ners shall be together , and they that for@@ sake the Lord shall be consu@@ med .
for they shall be as@@ ha@@ med of the o@@ aks which ye have desi@@ red , and ye shall be con@@ founded for the gar@@ den@@ s that ye have chosen .
for ye shall be as an o@@ ak whose le@@ af f@@ ade@@ th , and as a gar@@ den that hat@@ h no water .
and the strong shall be as to@@ w , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both bur@@ n together , and none shall qu@@ en@@ ch them .
O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , come ye , and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
therefore th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ sak@@ en TH@@ Y people the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , because they be rep@@ len@@ ished from the east , and are so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers like the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and they ple@@ ase themselves in the children of st@@ ran@@ gers .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots :
their land also is full of id@@ ols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fin@@ gers have made :
and the mean man bo@@ w@@ eth down , and the great man hum@@ ble@@ th himself : therefore for@@ give them not .
enter into the rock , and hide the@@ e in the d@@ ust , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
the lo@@ f@@ ty looks of man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be bo@@ wed down , and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lo@@ f@@ ty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and upon all the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an ,
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hil@@ ls that are lifted up ,
and the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
and they shall go into the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and into the c@@ aves of the ear@@ th , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty , when he ar@@ is@@ eth to shake ter@@ ri@@ bly the ear@@ th .
ce@@ ase ye from man , whose bre@@ ath is in his nos@@ tr@@ ils : for where@@ in is he to be accounted of ?
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father , saying , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast clo@@ thing , be th@@ ou our ru@@ ler , and let this ru@@ in be under TH@@ Y hand :
in that day shall he swe@@ ar , saying , I will not be an he@@ al@@ er ; for in my house is neither bread nor clo@@ thing : make me not a ru@@ ler of the people .
for Jer@@ usalem is ru@@ ined , and Ju@@ da@@ h is fallen : because their ton@@ gue and their do@@ ings are against the Lord , to prov@@ oke the eyes of his gl@@ ory .
the she@@ w of their coun@@ tenance do@@ th witness against them ; and they declare their sin as So@@ dom , they hide it not . Wo@@ e un@@ to their sou@@ l ! for they have re@@ warded ev@@ il un@@ to themselves .
say ye to the righ@@ te@@ ous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their do@@ ings .
Wo@@ e un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked ! it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
therefore the Lord will sm@@ ite with a sc@@ a@@ b the cro@@ wn of the head of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and the Lord will discover their secret parts .
TH@@ Y men shall fall by the s@@ word , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty in the war .
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man , saying , We will eat our own bread , and wear our own appar@@ el : only let us be called by TH@@ Y name , to take away our re@@ pro@@ ach .
in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and g@@ lor@@ ious , and the fruit of the ear@@ th shall be excellent and co@@ mely for them that are escaped of Israel .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Z@@ ion , and he that remain@@ eth in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even every one that is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem :
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from the mid@@ st there@@ of by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
now will I sing to my wel@@ l@@ bel@@ ov@@ ed a song of my bel@@ ov@@ ed tou@@ ching his v@@ ine@@ yard . my wel@@ l@@ bel@@ ov@@ ed hat@@ h a v@@ ine@@ yard in a very fruit@@ ful hill :
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? where@@ fore , when I looked that it should bring forth grap@@ es , brought it forth wild grap@@ es ?
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that join house to house , that lay field to field , ti@@ ll there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th !
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , ti@@ ll wine inf@@ la@@ me them !
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pip@@ e , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into cap@@ tivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honour@@ able men are fam@@ ished , and their multi@@ tude dri@@ ed up with thir@@ st .
therefore hell hat@@ h en@@ lar@@ ged her@@ self , and opened her m@@ outh without measure : and their gl@@ ory , and their multi@@ tude , and their pom@@ p , and he that re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth , shall des@@ cen@@ d into it .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the eyes of the lo@@ f@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led :
but the Lord of hosts shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in judgment , and God that is hol@@ y shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then shall the lam@@ bs fe@@ ed after their manner , and the waste places of the f@@ at ones shall st@@ ran@@ gers eat .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that draw in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity with cor@@ ds of van@@ ity , and sin as it were with a c@@ art ro@@ pe :
that say , Let him make speed , and has@@ ten his work , that we may see it : and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw n@@ igh and come , that we may know it !
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that call ev@@ il good , and good ev@@ il ; that put d@@ ark@@ ness for light , and light for d@@ ark@@ ness ; that put bitter for swe@@ et , and swe@@ et for bitter !
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that are wise in their own eyes , and pru@@ dent in their own sight !
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will his@@ s un@@ to them from the end of the ear@@ th : and , be@@ hold , they shall come with speed swi@@ f@@ tly :
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the gir@@ dle of their lo@@ ins be lo@@ os@@ ed , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
whose ar@@ ro@@ ws are sharp , and all their bo@@ ws b@@ ent , their hor@@ ses ' ho@@ of@@ s shall be counted like F@@ lin@@ t , and their whe@@ els like a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
their ro@@ aring shall be like a lion , they shall ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons : ye@@ a , they shall ro@@ ar , and lay hold of the pre@@ y , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
in the year that king Uz@@ zi@@ ah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a th@@ r@@ one , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temp@@ le .
above it stood the ser@@ ap@@ h@@ ims : each one had six w@@ ings ; with tw@@ ain he covered his face , and with tw@@ ain he covered his feet , and with tw@@ ain he did fly .
and one cri@@ ed un@@ to another , and said , Holy , hol@@ y , hol@@ y , is the Lord of hosts : the whole ear@@ th is full of his gl@@ ory .
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cri@@ ed , and the house was filled with smoke .
then fle@@ w one of the ser@@ ap@@ h@@ ims un@@ to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the ton@@ gs from off the alt@@ ar :
and he laid it upon my m@@ outh , and said , L@@ o , this hat@@ h touched TH@@ Y li@@ ps ; and th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is taken away , and TH@@ Y sin p@@ urged .
and the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great for@@ sak@@ ing in the mid@@ st of the land .
and say un@@ to him , T@@ ake heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted for the two ta@@ ils of these smoking fire@@ brands , for the fierce an@@ ger of Re@@ z@@ in with Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
for the head of Syria is Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the head of Dam@@ as@@ cus is Re@@ z@@ in ; and within thre@@ es@@ core and five years shall E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im be broken , that it be not a people .
and the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is Samar@@ ia , and the head of Samar@@ ia is Rem@@ ali@@ ah 's son . if ye will not believe , su@@ rely ye shall not be established .
therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; be@@ hold , a vir@@ gin shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Im@@ man@@ uel .
but@@ ter and hon@@ ey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the ev@@ il , and choose the good .
for before the child shall know to refuse the ev@@ il , and choose the good , the land that th@@ ou ab@@ hor@@ rest shall be for@@ sak@@ en of both her kings .
the Lord shall bring upon the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y people , and upon TH@@ Y father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im depar@@ ted from Ju@@ da@@ h ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall his@@ s for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , and in the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and upon all thor@@ ns , and upon all bus@@ hes .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall no@@ ur@@ ish a young cow , and two she@@ ep ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the ri@@ ches of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the sp@@ oil of Samar@@ ia shall be taken away before the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
take coun@@ sel together , and it shall come to n@@ ought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
for the Lord sp@@ ake thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , A conf@@ eder@@ acy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A conf@@ eder@@ acy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
and he shall be for a sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of off@@ ence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a sn@@ are to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem .
and many among them shall st@@ um@@ ble , and fall , and be broken , and be s@@ nar@@ ed , and be taken .
and I will wait upon the Lord , that hi@@ de@@ th his face from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and I will look for him .
be@@ hold , I and the children whom the Lord hat@@ h given me are for signs and for won@@ ders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in mount Z@@ ion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bes@@ te@@ ad and hun@@ gry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hun@@ gry , they shall fre@@ t themselves , and cur@@ se their king and their God , and look up@@ ward .
and they shall look un@@ to the ear@@ th ; and be@@ hold trouble and d@@ ark@@ ness , di@@ m@@ ness of an@@ gu@@ ish ; and they shall be driven to d@@ ark@@ ness .
the people that walked in d@@ ark@@ ness have seen a great light : they that d@@ well in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hat@@ h the light sh@@ ined .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast multi@@ p@@ lied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before the@@ e according to the joy in har@@ v@@ est , and as men re@@ jo@@ ice when they divide the sp@@ oil .
for every battle of the war@@ ri@@ or is with conf@@ used no@@ ise , and gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for the people tur@@ net@@ h not un@@ to him that sm@@ ite@@ th them , neither do they seek the Lord of hosts .
the ancient and honour@@ able , he is the head ; and the pro@@ phe@@ t that teach@@ eth lies , he is the ta@@ il .
for the leaders of this people cause them to er@@ r ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
through the wr@@ ath of the Lord of hosts is the land dar@@ ken@@ ed , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spar@@ e his brother .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that decree un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous decre@@ es , and that write gri@@ ev@@ ous@@ ness which they have pres@@ cri@@ bed ;
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your gl@@ ory ?
without me they shall bo@@ w down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the sla@@ in . for all this his an@@ ger is not turned away , but his hand is stret@@ ched out still .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it he mean@@ eth not so , neither do@@ th his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
as my hand hat@@ h found the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the id@@ ols , and whose Gra@@ ven images did exc@@ el them of Jer@@ usalem and of Samar@@ ia ;
shall I not , as I have done un@@ to Samar@@ ia and her id@@ ols , so do to Jer@@ usalem and her id@@ ols ?
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his f@@ at ones le@@ ann@@ ess ; and under his gl@@ ory he shall kin@@ dle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me : and it shall bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day ;
and shall consum@@ e the gl@@ ory of his forest , and of his fruit@@ ful field , both sou@@ l and body : and they shall be as when a standard@@ be@@ ar@@ er fa@@ in@@ te@@ th .
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few , that a child may write them .
for though TH@@ Y people Israel be as the s@@ and of the sea , yet a re@@ mn@@ ant of them shall return : the consumption decre@@ ed shall over@@ flow with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
for yet a very little while , and the in@@ dign@@ ation shall ce@@ ase , and mine an@@ ger in their destruction .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting .
he is come to A@@ i@@ ath , he is passed to Mig@@ ron ; at Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h he hat@@ h laid up his carri@@ ages :
they are gone over the passage : they have taken up their lo@@ d@@ ging at Ge@@ ba ; Ram@@ ah is afraid ; Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul is fled .
as yet shall he remain at No@@ b that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Z@@ ion , the hill of Jer@@ usalem .
be@@ hold , the Lord , the Lord of hosts , shall lo@@ p the b@@ ough with terror : and the high ones of stat@@ ure shall be he@@ wn down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led .
and there shall come forth a ro@@ d out of the stem of J@@ es@@ se , and a Bran@@ ch shall grow out of his roots :
and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wis@@ dom and understanding , the spirit of coun@@ sel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord ;
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither re@@ prove after the hearing of his e@@ ars :
the w@@ ol@@ f also shall d@@ well with the lam@@ b , and the Le@@ op@@ ard shall lie down with the k@@ id ; and the cal@@ f and the young lion and the fat@@ ling together ; and a little child shall lead them .
and the cow and the bear shall fe@@ ed ; their young ones shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat stra@@ w like the o@@ x .
and the suc@@ king child shall play on the hol@@ e of the as@@ p , and the we@@ an@@ ed child shall put his hand on the co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce ' den .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my hol@@ y mountain : for the ear@@ th shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
and in that day there shall be a root of J@@ es@@ se , which shall stand for an en@@ sign of the people ; to it shall the Gen@@ ti@@ les seek : and his rest shall be g@@ lor@@ ious .
and he shall set up an en@@ sign for the nations , and shall assem@@ ble the out@@ casts of Israel , and gather together the disper@@ sed of Ju@@ da@@ h from the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th .
the en@@ v@@ y also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall de@@ part , and the ad@@ vers@@ aries of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be cut off : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall not en@@ v@@ y Ju@@ da@@ h , and Ju@@ da@@ h shall not ve@@ x E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but they shall fly upon the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall sp@@ oil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obe@@ y them .
and in that day th@@ ou s@@ halt say , O Lord , I will praise the@@ e : though th@@ ou w@@ ast angry with me , th@@ ine an@@ ger is turned away , and th@@ ou comfor@@ ted@@ st me .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation ; I will trust , and not be afraid : for the Lord J@@ eh@@ ov@@ ah is my strength and my song ; he also is become my sal@@ vation .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wel@@ ls of sal@@ vation .
the burden of Bab@@ yl@@ on , which I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ mo@@ z did see .
lift ye up a ban@@ ner upon the high mountain , ex@@ alt the voice un@@ to them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the no@@ bles .
I have comman@@ ded my sanc@@ ti@@ fied ones , I have also called my m@@ igh@@ ty ones for mine an@@ ger , even them that re@@ jo@@ ice in my high@@ ness .
the no@@ ise of a multi@@ tude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous no@@ ise of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of nations gathered together : the Lord of hosts mu@@ ster@@ eth the host of the battle .
they come from a far country , from the end of heav@@ en , even the Lord , and the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation , to destroy the whole land .
be@@ hold , the day of the Lord co@@ me@@ th , cru@@ el both with wr@@ ath and fierce an@@ ger , to lay the land de@@ so@@ late : and he shall destroy the sin@@ ners there@@ of out of it .
for the stars of heav@@ en and the con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations there@@ of shall not give their light : the sun shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to sh@@ ine .
and I will punish the world for their ev@@ il , and the w@@ ic@@ ked for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will cause the ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy of the proud to ce@@ ase , and will lay low the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
I will make a man more pre@@ ci@@ ous than fine gold ; even a man than the golden w@@ edge of Op@@ hir .
therefore I will shake the heav@@ ens , and the ear@@ th shall remove out of her place , in the wr@@ ath of the Lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce an@@ ger .
and it shall be as the ch@@ ased ro@@ e , and as a she@@ ep that no man tak@@ eth up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
every one that is found shall be th@@ rust through ; and every one that is joined un@@ to them shall fall by the s@@ word .
their children also shall be d@@ ashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be sp@@ o@@ iled , and their wi@@ ves ra@@ vis@@ hed .
be@@ hold , I will stir up the Me@@ des against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not de@@ light in it .
their bo@@ ws also shall d@@ ash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b ; their eye shall not spar@@ e children .
it shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be d@@ wel@@ t in from generation to generation : neither shall the Ara@@ bi@@ an pit@@ ch tent there ; neither shall the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their fold there .
but wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of do@@ le@@ ful cre@@ atures ; and ow@@ ls shall d@@ well there , and sat@@ yr@@ s shall dance there .
and the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall cry in their de@@ so@@ late houses , and dra@@ g@@ ons in their pleas@@ ant pal@@ aces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prol@@ on@@ ged .
for the Lord will have mer@@ cy on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the st@@ ran@@ gers shall be joined with them , and they shall cle@@ ave to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
the Lord hat@@ h broken the staff of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and the scep@@ tre of the rul@@ ers .
he who smo@@ te the people in wr@@ ath with a contin@@ ual stro@@ ke , he that ruled the nations in an@@ ger , is persec@@ uted , and none hin@@ der@@ eth .
the whole ear@@ th is at rest , and is quiet : they break forth into singing .
Ye@@ a , the f@@ ir trees re@@ jo@@ ice at the@@ e , and the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon , saying , S@@ ince th@@ ou art laid down , no F@@ eller is come up against us .
TH@@ Y pom@@ p is brought down to the grave , and the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y viol@@ s : the wor@@ m is spread under the@@ e , and the wor@@ ms cover the@@ e .
how art th@@ ou fallen from heav@@ en , O Lu@@ ci@@ fer , son of the morning ! how art th@@ ou cut down to the ground , which di@@ d@@ st weak@@ en the nations !
yet th@@ ou s@@ halt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the p@@ it .
all the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in gl@@ ory , every one in his own house .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not be joined with them in bur@@ ial , because th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed TH@@ Y land , and sla@@ in TH@@ Y people : the se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers shall never be renowned .
prepare sla@@ ughter for his children for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of their fa@@ thers ; that they do not rise , nor poss@@ ess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
I will also make it a possession for the bit@@ tern , and po@@ ols of water : and I will swe@@ ep it with the bes@@ om of destruction , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sworn , saying , su@@ rely as I have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as I have pur@@ posed , so shall it stand :
this is the purpose that is pur@@ posed upon the whole ear@@ th : and this is the hand that is stret@@ ched out upon all the nations .
for the Lord of hosts hat@@ h pur@@ posed , and who shall dis@@ annul it ? and his hand is stret@@ ched out , and who shall turn it back ?
re@@ jo@@ ice not th@@ ou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the ro@@ d of him that smo@@ te the@@ e is broken : for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root shall come forth a co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce , and his fruit shall be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
and the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor shall fe@@ ed , and the ne@@ edy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill TH@@ Y root with fam@@ ine , and he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y re@@ mn@@ ant .
the burden of Mo@@ a@@ b . because in the night A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and brought to sil@@ ence ; because in the night K@@ ir of Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and brought to sil@@ ence ;
he is gone up to Baj@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , the high places , to we@@ ep : Mo@@ a@@ b shall ho@@ w@@ l over N@@ eb@@ o , and over M@@ ede@@ ba : on all their heads shall be bal@@ d@@ ness , and every be@@ ard cut off .
in their streets they shall gir@@ d themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall ho@@ w@@ l , we@@ eping ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly .
and H@@ es@@ h@@ bon shall cry , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : their voice shall be heard even un@@ to Ja@@ haz : therefore the armed soldiers of Mo@@ a@@ b shall cry out ; his life shall be gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to him .
for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim shall be de@@ so@@ late : for the ha@@ y is with@@ ered away , the gr@@ ass fail@@ eth , there is no green thing .
therefore the ab@@ und@@ ance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the Bro@@ ok of the w@@ il@@ lows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Mo@@ a@@ b ; the ho@@ w@@ ling there@@ of un@@ to Eg@@ la@@ im , and the ho@@ w@@ ling there@@ of un@@ to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ el@@ im .
for the waters of Dim@@ on shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dim@@ on , li@@ ons upon him that escap@@ eth of Mo@@ a@@ b , and upon the re@@ mn@@ ant of the land .
send ye the lam@@ b to the ru@@ ler of the land from Sel@@ a to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , un@@ to the mount of the daughter of Z@@ ion .
for it shall be , that , as a w@@ and@@ ering bird cast out of the n@@ est , so the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Mo@@ a@@ b shall be at the for@@ ds of Ar@@ non .
therefore I will be@@ wa@@ il with the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er the v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h : I will water the@@ e with my te@@ ars , O H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : for the sh@@ ou@@ ting for TH@@ Y summer fru@@ its and for TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est is fallen .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ a@@ b is we@@ ary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y ; but he shall not prev@@ ail .
this is the word that the Lord hat@@ h spoken concerning Mo@@ a@@ b since that time .
the burden of Dam@@ as@@ cus . be@@ hold , Dam@@ as@@ cus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ ap .
the cities of A@@ ro@@ er are for@@ sak@@ en : they shall be for f@@ loc@@ ks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress also shall ce@@ ase from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the k@@ ing@@ dom from Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Syria : they shall be as the gl@@ ory of the children of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the gl@@ ory of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be made th@@ in , and the fat@@ ness of his f@@ les@@ h shall wa@@ x le@@ an .
and it shall be as when the har@@ v@@ est@@ man gather@@ eth the cor@@ n , and re@@ ap@@ eth the e@@ ars with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gather@@ eth e@@ ars in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
at that day shall a man look to his Mak@@ er , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
and he shall not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fin@@ gers have made , either the gro@@ ves , or the images .
in that day shall his strong cities be as a for@@ sak@@ en b@@ ough , and an up@@ per@@ most branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be de@@ so@@ lation .
Wo@@ e to the multi@@ tude of many people , which make a no@@ ise like the no@@ ise of the seas ; and to the rus@@ hing of nations , that make a rus@@ hing like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
and be@@ hold at even@@ ing@@ ti@@ de trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that sp@@ oil us , and the lot of them that ro@@ b us .
for a@@ fore the har@@ v@@ est , when the bu@@ d is perfect , and the s@@ our gra@@ pe is ri@@ pen@@ ing in the f@@ lower , he shall both cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and take away and cut down the branches .
and I will set the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans against the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will I give over into the hand of a cru@@ el lor@@ d ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , sa@@ ith the Lord , the Lord of hosts .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be was@@ ted and dri@@ ed up .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the bro@@ oks of defence shall be emp@@ tied and dri@@ ed up : the re@@ eds and flags shall wi@@ ther .
the fis@@ hers also shall mour@@ n , and all they that cast an@@ gle into the bro@@ oks shall la@@ ment , and they that spread n@@ ets upon the waters shall langu@@ ish .
moreover they that work in fine fla@@ x , and they that we@@ ave networks , shall be con@@ founded .
and they shall be broken in the purposes there@@ of , all that make s@@ lu@@ ices and pon@@ ds for fish .
where are they ? where are TH@@ Y wise men ? and let them tell the@@ e now , and let them know what the Lord of hosts hat@@ h pur@@ posed upon Egypt .
the pr@@ inces of Zo@@ an are become fo@@ ols , the pr@@ inces of N@@ op@@ h are dec@@ e@@ ived ; they have also s@@ educ@@ ed Egypt , even they that are the stay of the tri@@ bes there@@ of .
the Lord hat@@ h min@@ g@@ led a per@@ verse spirit in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and they have caused Egypt to er@@ r in every work there@@ of , as a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ ger@@ eth in his v@@ om@@ it .
in that day shall Egypt be like un@@ to women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shak@@ eth over it .
and the land of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be a terror un@@ to Egypt , every one that mak@@ eth mention there@@ of shall be afraid in himself , because of the coun@@ sel of the Lord of hosts , which he hat@@ h determined against it .
in that day shall there be an alt@@ ar to the Lord in the mid@@ st of the land of Egypt , and a pil@@ lar at the border there@@ of to the Lord .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and perform it .
in that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall serve with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans .
so shall the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a lead away the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans prisoners , and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians cap@@ tives , young and old , nak@@ ed and bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot , even with their but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the sh@@ ame of Egypt .
the burden of the de@@ sert of the sea . as wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds in the south pass through ; so it co@@ me@@ th from the de@@ sert , from a ter@@ ri@@ ble land .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with p@@ ain : pan@@ gs have taken hold upon me , as the pan@@ gs of a woman that trav@@ ail@@ eth : I was bo@@ wed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
my heart p@@ anted , fear@@ ful@@ ness aff@@ righ@@ ted me : the night of my pleas@@ ure hat@@ h he turned into fear un@@ to me .
for thus hat@@ h the Lord said un@@ to me , G@@ o , set a watch@@ man , let him declare what he se@@ eth .
and he saw a char@@ i@@ ot with a couple of hor@@ se@@ men , a char@@ i@@ ot of ass@@ es , and a char@@ i@@ ot of ca@@ me@@ ls ; and he hear@@ ken@@ ed dil@@ ig@@ ently with much heed :
and he cri@@ ed , A lion : my lor@@ d , I stand continu@@ ally upon the watch@@ to@@ wer in the day@@ time , and I am set in my ward whole n@@ ights :
O my th@@ res@@ hing , and the cor@@ n of my floor : that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared un@@ to you .
the burden upon Arabia . in the forest in Arabia shall ye lo@@ dge , O ye travelling companies of D@@ ed@@ an@@ im .
the inhabitants of the land of TE@@ MA brought water to him that was thir@@ st@@ y , they prevented with their bread him that fled .
for they fled from the s@@ words , from the drawn s@@ word , and from the b@@ ent bo@@ w , and from the gri@@ ev@@ ous@@ ness of war .
for thus hat@@ h the Lord said un@@ to me , With@@ in a year , according to the years of an hi@@ re@@ ling , and all the gl@@ ory of K@@ ed@@ ar shall fail :
and the resi@@ due of the number of ar@@ chers , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of the children of K@@ ed@@ ar , shall be dimin@@ ished : for the Lord God of Israel hat@@ h spoken it .
all TH@@ Y rul@@ ers are fled together , they are bound by the ar@@ chers : all that are found in the@@ e are bound together , which have fled from far .
and it shall come to pass , that TH@@ Y cho@@ ic@@ est val@@ ley@@ s shall be full of char@@ i@@ ots , and the hor@@ se@@ men shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discovered the covering of Ju@@ da@@ h , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st look in that day to the arm@@ our of the house of the forest .
Y@@ e have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and ye have num@@ ber@@ ed the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses have ye broken down to for@@ ti@@ fy the wall .
Y@@ e made also a di@@ t@@ ch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked un@@ to the maker there@@ of , neither had respect un@@ to him that fas@@ hi@@ oned it long ago .
and in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to we@@ eping , and to mourning , and to bal@@ d@@ ness , and to gir@@ ding with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th :
be@@ hold , the Lord will carry the@@ e away with a m@@ igh@@ ty cap@@ tivity , and will su@@ rely cover the@@ e .
he will su@@ rely viol@@ ently turn and Tos@@ s the@@ e like a ball into a large country : there s@@ halt th@@ ou die , and there the char@@ i@@ ots of TH@@ Y gl@@ ory shall be the sh@@ ame of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house .
and I will drive the@@ e from TH@@ Y station , and from TH@@ Y state shall he pull the@@ e down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my ser@@ vant Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah :
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his sho@@ ul@@ der ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and I will fas@@ ten him as a na@@ il in a sure place ; and he shall be for a g@@ lor@@ ious th@@ r@@ one to his father 's house .
and they shall han@@ g upon him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , all vessels of small quanti@@ ty , from the vessels of c@@ ups , even to all the vessels of fla@@ g@@ ons .
be still , ye inhabitants of the is@@ le ; th@@ ou whom the mer@@ chan@@ ts of Z@@ id@@ on , that pass over the sea , have rep@@ len@@ ished .
and by great waters the se@@ ed of S@@ ih@@ or , the har@@ v@@ est of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a Mart of nations .
be th@@ ou as@@ ha@@ med , O Z@@ id@@ on : for the sea hat@@ h spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , I trav@@ ail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I no@@ ur@@ ish up young men , nor bring up vir@@ g@@ ins .
as at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be so@@ rely pain@@ ed at the report of T@@ y@@ re .
is this your jo@@ y@@ ous city , whose antiqu@@ ity is of ancient days ? her own feet shall carry her af@@ ar off to so@@ jour@@ n .
the Lord of hosts hat@@ h pur@@ posed it , to st@@ ain the pride of all gl@@ ory , and to bring into con@@ temp@@ t all the honour@@ able of the ear@@ th .
he stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , he sho@@ ok the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms : the Lord hat@@ h given a comman@@ d@@ ment against the mer@@ chan@@ t city , to destroy the strong holds there@@ of .
be@@ hold , the Lord mak@@ eth the ear@@ th empty , and mak@@ eth it waste , and tur@@ net@@ h it U@@ p@@ side down , and sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth abroad the inhabitants there@@ of .
the land shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly emp@@ tied , and ut@@ ter@@ ly sp@@ o@@ iled : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken this word .
the ear@@ th mour@@ net@@ h and f@@ ade@@ th away , the world langu@@ is@@ het@@ h and f@@ ade@@ th away , the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty people of the ear@@ th do langu@@ ish .
the ear@@ th also is def@@ iled under the inhabitants there@@ of ; because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed the laws , changed the ordin@@ ance , broken the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
therefore hat@@ h the cur@@ se dev@@ oured the ear@@ th , and they that d@@ well there@@ in are de@@ so@@ late : therefore the inhabitants of the ear@@ th are burned , and few men left .
the mir@@ th of tab@@ re@@ ts ce@@ as@@ eth , the no@@ ise of them that re@@ jo@@ ice en@@ de@@ th , the joy of the har@@ p ce@@ as@@ eth .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
the city of conf@@ usion is broken down : every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a cr@@ ying for wine in the streets ; all joy is dar@@ ken@@ ed , the mir@@ th of the land is gone .
in the city is left de@@ so@@ lation , and the gate is s@@ mit@@ ten with destruction .
when thus it shall be in the mid@@ st of the land among the people , there shall be as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , and as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ing grap@@ es when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
they shall lift up their voice , they shall sing for the maj@@ es@@ ty of the Lord , they shall cry al@@ oud from the sea .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore g@@ lor@@ ify ye the Lord in the fires , even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the is@@ les of the sea .
fear , and the p@@ it , and the sn@@ are , are upon the@@ e , O inhabi@@ tant of the ear@@ th .
the ear@@ th is ut@@ ter@@ ly broken down , the ear@@ th is clean dis@@ solved , the ear@@ th is moved exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th upon the ear@@ th .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
O Lord , th@@ ou art my God ; I will ex@@ alt the@@ e , I will praise TH@@ Y name ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast done won@@ der@@ ful things ; TH@@ Y coun@@ sels of old are fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and truth .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast made of a city an he@@ ap ; of a def@@ enced city a ru@@ in : a palace of st@@ ran@@ gers to be no city ; it shall never be built .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers , as the heat in a d@@ ry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cl@@ oud : the branch of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make un@@ to all people a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of win@@ es on the le@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of win@@ es on the le@@ es well refin@@ ed .
he will sw@@ allow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces ; and the re@@ bu@@ ke of his people shall he take away from off all the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Mo@@ a@@ b shall be tro@@ dden down under him , even as stra@@ w is tro@@ dden down for the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
and the fortress of the high For@@ t of TH@@ Y walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
in that day shall this song be sun@@ g in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ; We have a strong city ; sal@@ vation will God appoint for walls and bul@@ war@@ ks .
open ye the gates , that the righ@@ te@@ ous nation which keep@@ eth the truth may enter in .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on the@@ e : because he tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e .
the fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad it down , even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the ne@@ edy .
the way of the just is u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : th@@ ou , most u@@ pri@@ ght , dost we@@ igh the path of the just .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red the@@ e in the night ; ye@@ a , with my spirit within me will I seek the@@ e early : for when TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world will learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let favour be she@@ wed to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet will he not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness will he deal un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , and will not be@@ hold the maj@@ es@@ ty of the Lord .
O Lord our God , other lor@@ ds bes@@ ide the@@ e have had domin@@ ion over us : but by the@@ e only will we make mention of TH@@ Y name .
Lord , in trouble have they visited the@@ e , they p@@ oured out a pray@@ er when TH@@ Y ch@@ as@@ tening was upon them .
like as a woman with child , that dra@@ w@@ eth near the time of her delivery , is in p@@ ain , and cri@@ eth out in her pan@@ gs ; so have we been in TH@@ Y sight , O Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in p@@ ain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not w@@ rought any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter th@@ ou into TH@@ Y ch@@ ambers , and shut TH@@ Y doors about the@@ e : hide th@@ y@@ self as it were for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation be over@@ past .
in that day the Lord with his sor@@ e and great and strong s@@ word shall punish le@@ vi@@ athan the pi@@ er@@ cing ser@@ p@@ ent , even le@@ vi@@ athan that cro@@ oked ser@@ p@@ ent ; and he shall s@@ lay the dra@@ g@@ on that is in the sea .
I the Lord do keep it ; I will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , I will keep it night and day .
fur@@ y is not in me : who would set the bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns against me in battle ? I would go through them , I would bur@@ n them together .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
he shall cause them that come of Jac@@ o@@ b to take root : Israel shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m and bu@@ d , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
H@@ ath he s@@ mit@@ ten him , as he smo@@ te those that smo@@ te him ? or is he sla@@ in according to the sla@@ ughter of them that are sla@@ in by him ?
in measure , when it sho@@ ote@@ th forth , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t debate with it : he stay@@ eth his roug@@ h wind in the day of the east wind .
yet the def@@ enced city shall be de@@ so@@ late , and the habi@@ tation for@@ sak@@ en , and left like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : there shall the cal@@ f fe@@ ed , and there shall he lie down , and consum@@ e the branches there@@ of .
Wo@@ e to the cro@@ wn of pride , to the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , whose g@@ lor@@ ious beauty is a f@@ ading f@@ lower , which are on the head of the f@@ at val@@ ley@@ s of them that are overcome with wine !
the cro@@ wn of pride , the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , shall be tro@@ dden under feet :
in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory , and for a di@@ ade@@ m of beauty , un@@ to the resi@@ due of his people ,
and for a spirit of judgment to him that sit@@ te@@ th in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
for all tables are full of v@@ om@@ it and fil@@ th@@ iness , so that there is no place clean .
to whom he said , This is the rest where@@ with ye may cause the we@@ ary to rest ; and this is the ref@@ res@@ hing : yet they would not hear .
and your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with death shall be dis@@ annulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the over@@ flow@@ ing s@@ cour@@ ge shall pass through , then ye shall be tro@@ dden down by it .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narro@@ wer than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the Lord shall rise up as in mount Per@@ az@@ im , he shall be wro@@ th as in the val@@ ley of Gi@@ be@@ on , that he may do his work , his st@@ range work ; and bring to pass his act , his st@@ range act .
now therefore be ye not mo@@ c@@ kers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole ear@@ th .
Do@@ th the p@@ low@@ man plo@@ w all day to so@@ w ? do@@ th he open and break the clo@@ ds of his ground ?
when he hat@@ h made pla@@ in the face there@@ of , do@@ th he not cast abroad the f@@ it@@ ches , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ min , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed bar@@ ley and ri@@ e in their place ?
for the f@@ it@@ ches are not th@@ res@@ hed with a th@@ res@@ hing instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned about upon the cum@@ min ; but the f@@ it@@ ches are beaten out with a staff , and the cum@@ min with a ro@@ d .
bread cor@@ n is bru@@ ised ; because he will not ever be th@@ res@@ hing it , nor break it with the whe@@ el of his c@@ art , nor bru@@ ise it with his hor@@ se@@ men .
yet I will dist@@ ress Ari@@ el , and there shall be heav@@ iness and sor@@ row : and it shall be un@@ to me as Ari@@ el .
and I will camp against the@@ e round about , and will lay siege against the@@ e with a mount , and I will raise for@@ ts against the@@ e .
moreover the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers shall be like small d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be as c@@ haf@@ f that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an in@@ stan@@ t su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be visited of the Lord of hosts with Th@@ under , and with earthquake , and great no@@ ise , with storm and temp@@ est , and the fla@@ me of dev@@ our@@ ing fire .
for the Lord hat@@ h p@@ oured out upon you the spirit of deep sle@@ ep , and hat@@ h closed your eyes : the pro@@ ph@@ ets and your rul@@ ers , the se@@ ers hat@@ h he covered .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field shall be es@@ te@@ emed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the de@@ af hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity , and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
the me@@ ek also shall increase their joy in the Lord , and the poor among men shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the ter@@ ri@@ ble one is brought to n@@ ought , and the scor@@ ner is consu@@ med , and all that watch for in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity are cut off :
that make a man an offen@@ der for a word , and lay a sn@@ are for him that re@@ pro@@ vet@@ h in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of n@@ ought .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord , who re@@ deemed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , concerning the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , Jac@@ o@@ b shall not now be as@@ ha@@ med , neither shall his face now wa@@ x p@@ ale .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and shall fear the God of Israel .
they also that er@@ red in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that mur@@ mu@@ red shall learn doc@@ tr@@ ine .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the Holy One of Israel to ce@@ ase from before us .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore thus sa@@ ith the Holy One of Israel , Bec@@ ause ye desp@@ ise this word , and trust in op@@ pression and per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess , and stay there@@ on :
therefore this in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , s@@ wel@@ ling out in a high wall , whose breaking co@@ me@@ th su@@ d@@ den@@ ly at an in@@ stan@@ t .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel ; In returning and rest shall ye be sav@@ ed ; in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness and in confidence shall be your strength : and ye would not .
but ye said , No ; for we will flee upon hor@@ ses ; therefore shall ye flee : and , We will ride upon the swift ; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift .
for the people shall d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem : th@@ ou s@@ halt we@@ ep no more : he will be very gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the@@ e at the voice of TH@@ Y cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer the@@ e .
and th@@ ine e@@ ars shall hear a word behind the@@ e , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Y@@ e shall def@@ ile also the covering of TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of TH@@ Y m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold : th@@ ou s@@ halt cast them away as a men@@ stru@@ ous clo@@ th ; th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to it , G@@ et the@@ e hence .
the ox@@ en likewise and the young ass@@ es that e@@ ar the ground shall eat clean pro@@ ven@@ der , which hat@@ h been win@@ no@@ wed with the sh@@ ov@@ el and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and stre@@ ams of waters in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
be@@ hold , the name of the Lord co@@ me@@ th from far , burning with his an@@ ger , and the burden there@@ of is heavy : his li@@ ps are full of in@@ dign@@ ation , and his ton@@ gue as a dev@@ our@@ ing fire :
for through the voice of the Lord shall the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an be beaten down , which smo@@ te with a ro@@ d .
yet he also is wise , and will bring ev@@ il , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of them that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
as birds flying , so will the Lord of hosts defend Jer@@ usalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
for in that day every man shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver , and his id@@ ols of gold , which your own hands have made un@@ to you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a d@@ ry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a we@@ ary land .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the e@@ ars of them that hear shall he@@ arken .
the heart also of the ras@@ h shall understand knowledge , and the ton@@ gue of the st@@ ammer@@ ers shall be ready to speak pla@@ in@@ ly .
the v@@ ile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the chur@@ l said to be boun@@ ti@@ ful .
the instruments also of the chur@@ l are ev@@ il : he dev@@ is@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the ne@@ edy speak@@ eth right .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye car@@ ele@@ ss da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; give e@@ ar un@@ to my speech .
many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye car@@ ele@@ ss women : for the vin@@ t@@ age shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
Tre@@ m@@ ble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye car@@ ele@@ ss ones : stri@@ p you , and make you b@@ are , and gir@@ d s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th upon your lo@@ ins .
they shall la@@ ment for the te@@ ats , for the pleas@@ ant fields , for the fruit@@ ful v@@ ine .
until the spirit be p@@ oured upon us from on high , and the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness be a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field be counted for a forest .
and the work of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be peace ; and the effect of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness and assur@@ ance for ever .
and my people shall d@@ well in a peac@@ eable habi@@ tation , and in sure d@@ wel@@ lings , and in quiet resting places ;
when it shall ha@@ il , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
b@@ les@@ sed are ye that so@@ w bes@@ ide all waters , that send forth th@@ ither the feet of the o@@ x and the ass .
O Lord , be gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to us ; we have w@@ aited for the@@ e : be th@@ ou their arm every morning , our sal@@ vation also in the time of trouble .
at the no@@ ise of the t@@ um@@ ult the people fled ; at the lifting up of th@@ y@@ self the nations were sc@@ at@@ tered .
and your sp@@ oil shall be gathered like the gathering of the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler : as the running to and f@@ ro of loc@@ ust@@ s shall he run upon them .
the Lord is ex@@ al@@ ted ; for he d@@ wel@@ le@@ th on high : he hat@@ h filled Z@@ ion with judgment and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and wis@@ dom and knowledge shall be the stability of TH@@ Y times , and strength of sal@@ vation : the fear of the Lord is his treasure .
the highways lie waste , the w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man ce@@ as@@ eth : he hat@@ h broken the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , he hat@@ h desp@@ ised the cities , he regar@@ de@@ th no man .
the ear@@ th mour@@ net@@ h and langu@@ is@@ het@@ h : Lebanon is as@@ ha@@ med and he@@ wn down : Shar@@ on is like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and B@@ ash@@ an and Car@@ mel shake off their fru@@ its .
Y@@ e shall conce@@ ive c@@ haf@@ f , ye shall bring forth st@@ ub@@ ble : your bre@@ ath , as fire , shall dev@@ our you .
and the people shall be as the bur@@ nings of li@@ me : as thor@@ ns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he shall d@@ well on high : his place of defence shall be the mun@@ itions of ro@@ cks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
Th@@ ine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall be@@ hold the land that is very far off .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than th@@ ou can@@ st perce@@ ive ; of a st@@ ammer@@ ing ton@@ gue , that th@@ ou can@@ st not understand .
for the Lord is our judge , the Lord is our law@@ gi@@ ver , the Lord is our king ; he will save us .
TH@@ Y tack@@ lings are lo@@ os@@ ed ; they could not well strengthen their m@@ ast , they could not spread the sa@@ il : then is the pre@@ y of a great sp@@ oil divided ; the la@@ me take the pre@@ y .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and he@@ arken , ye people : let the ear@@ th hear , and all that is there@@ in ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord is upon all nations , and his fur@@ y upon all their armies : he hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , he hat@@ h delivered them to the sla@@ ughter .
their sla@@ in also shall be cast out , and their st@@ ink shall come up out of their car@@ cases , and the mountains shall be mel@@ ted with their blood .
and the un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns shall come down with them , and the bul@@ loc@@ ks with the bul@@ ls ; and their land shall be so@@ aked with blood , and their d@@ ust made f@@ at with fat@@ ness .
for it is the day of the Lord 's ven@@ ge@@ ance , and the year of re@@ comp@@ ences for the controversy of Z@@ ion .
and the stre@@ ams there@@ of shall be turned into pit@@ ch , and the d@@ ust there@@ of into bri@@ m@@ stone , and the land there@@ of shall become burning pit@@ ch .
it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day ; the smoke there@@ of shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cor@@ mor@@ ant and the bit@@ tern shall poss@@ ess it ; the ow@@ l also and the ra@@ ven shall d@@ well in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of conf@@ usion , and the stones of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
they shall call the no@@ bles there@@ of to the k@@ ing@@ dom , but none shall be there , and all her pr@@ inces shall be nothing .
and thor@@ ns shall come up in her pal@@ aces , net@@ t@@ les and br@@ amb@@ les in the for@@ t@@ resses there@@ of : and it shall be an habi@@ tation of dra@@ g@@ ons , and a court for ow@@ ls .
the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall also meet with the wild be@@ asts of the island , and the sat@@ y@@ r shall cry to his fellow ; the scre@@ ech ow@@ l also shall rest there , and find for her@@ self a place of rest .
there shall the great ow@@ l make her n@@ est , and lay , and Hat@@ ch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vul@@ tures also be gathered , every one with her M@@ ate .
the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the sol@@ itary place shall be glad for them ; and the de@@ sert shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and b@@ los@@ so@@ m as the rose .
then the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall be opened , and the e@@ ars of the de@@ af shall be un@@ stopped .
then shall the la@@ me man le@@ ap as an har@@ t , and the ton@@ gue of the dum@@ b sing : for in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness shall waters break out , and stre@@ ams in the de@@ sert .
and the par@@ ched ground shall become a pool , and the thir@@ st@@ y land spr@@ ings of water : in the habi@@ tation of dra@@ g@@ ons , where each lay , shall be gr@@ ass with re@@ eds and rus@@ hes .
no lion shall be there , nor any ra@@ ven@@ ous be@@ ast shall go up there@@ on , it shall not be found there ; but the re@@ deemed shall walk there :
and the ran@@ so@@ med of the Lord shall return , and come to Z@@ ion with songs and ever@@ lasting joy upon their heads : they shall obtain joy and gla@@ d@@ ness , and sor@@ row and si@@ gh@@ ing shall flee away .
now it came to pass in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against all the def@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and took them .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great army . and he stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
then came forth un@@ to him Eli@@ ak@@ im , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah 's son , which was over the house , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , A@@ sap@@ h 's son , the rec@@ order .
I say , say@@ est th@@ ou , ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for war : now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
now therefore give pledges , I pra@@ y the@@ e , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , He@@ ar ye the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
thus sa@@ ith the king , Let not H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah dec@@ e@@ ive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
be@@ w@@ are lest H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , saying , The Lord will deliver us . H@@ ath any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
where are the go@@ ds of Ham@@ ath and Ar@@ p@@ had ? where are the go@@ ds of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim ? and have they delivered Samar@@ ia out of my hand ?
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , un@@ to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
so R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h returned , and found the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a war@@ ring against Lib@@ n@@ ah : for he had heard that he was depar@@ ted from L@@ ach@@ ish .
and he heard say concerning Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , He is come forth to make war with the@@ e . and when he heard it , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God , in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test , dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast heard what the kings of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a have done to all lands by destroying them ut@@ ter@@ ly ; and s@@ halt th@@ ou be delivered ?
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
where is the king of Ham@@ ath , and the king of Ar@@ p@@ had , and the king of the city of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , H@@ ena , and Iv@@ ah ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up un@@ to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
In@@ cl@@ ine th@@ ine e@@ ar , O Lord , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , O Lord , and see : and hear all the words of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b , which hat@@ h sent to re@@ pro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , save us from his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that th@@ ou art the Lord , even th@@ ou only .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dig@@ ged , and dr@@ un@@ k water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dri@@ ed up all the rivers of the bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed places .
but I know TH@@ Y abo@@ de , and TH@@ Y going out , and TH@@ Y coming in , and TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me .
and the re@@ mn@@ ant that is escaped of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall again take root down@@ ward , and bear fruit up@@ ward :
for out of Jer@@ usalem shall go forth a re@@ mn@@ ant , and they that escape out of mount Z@@ ion : the z@@ e@@ al of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , He shall not come into this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there nor come before it with shi@@ elds , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , sa@@ ith the Lord .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord went forth , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans a hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah turned his face toward the wall , and pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord ,
then came the word of the Lord to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
and I will deliver the@@ e and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will defend this city .
and this shall be a sign un@@ to the@@ e from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that he hat@@ h spoken ;
the writing of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , when he had been si@@ ck , and was recovered of his si@@ ck@@ ness :
I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am de@@ pri@@ ved of the resi@@ due of my years .
I said , I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living : I shall be@@ hold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
I rec@@ kon@@ ed ti@@ ll morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my b@@ ones : from day even to night w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou make an end of me .
like a cr@@ ane or a sw@@ allow , so did I ch@@ at@@ ter : I did mour@@ n as a do@@ ve : mine eyes fail with looking up@@ ward : O Lord , I am op@@ pressed ; undertake for me .
what shall I say ? he hat@@ h both spoken un@@ to me , and himself hat@@ h done it : I shall go sof@@ tly all my years in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
O Lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou rec@@ over me , and make me to live .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great bit@@ ter@@ ness : but th@@ ou h@@ ast in love to my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption : for th@@ ou h@@ ast cast all my sin@@ s behind TH@@ Y back .
for the grave can@@ not praise the@@ e , death can not celebrate the@@ e : they that go down into the p@@ it can@@ not hope for TH@@ Y truth .
the living , the living , he shall praise the@@ e , as I do this day : the father to the children shall make known TH@@ Y truth .
the Lord was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the str@@ ing@@ ed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .
for I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had said , Let them take a lum@@ p of fig@@ s , and lay it for a pla@@ ister upon the bo@@ il , and he shall rec@@ over .
then said he , What have they seen in th@@ ine house ? and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered , All that is in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not she@@ wed them .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
speak ye comfor@@ tably to Jer@@ usalem , and cry un@@ to her , that her war@@ fare is accomplished , that her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ don@@ ed : for she hat@@ h received of the Lord 's hand double for all her sin@@ s .
every val@@ ley shall be ex@@ al@@ ted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the cro@@ oked shall be made stra@@ ight , and the roug@@ h places pla@@ in :
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all f@@ les@@ h shall see it together : for the m@@ outh of the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
the gr@@ ass with@@ er@@ eth , the f@@ lower f@@ ade@@ th : because the spirit of the Lord b@@ low@@ eth upon it : su@@ rely the people is gr@@ ass .
be@@ hold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
he shall fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : he shall gather the lam@@ bs with his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om , and shall g@@ ently lead those that are with young .
with whom took he coun@@ sel , and who instruc@@ ted him , and ta@@ ught him in the path of judgment , and ta@@ ught him knowledge , and she@@ wed to him the way of understanding ?
be@@ hold , the nations are as a drop of a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are counted as the small d@@ ust of the balance : be@@ hold , he tak@@ eth up the is@@ les as a very little thing .
all nations before him are as nothing ; and they are counted to him less than nothing , and van@@ ity .
to whom then will ye lik@@ en God ? or what lik@@ eness will ye compar@@ e un@@ to him ?
the work@@ man mel@@ te@@ th a Gra@@ ven image , and the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th it over with gold , and cas@@ te@@ th silver cha@@ ins .
he that is so imp@@ over@@ ished that he hat@@ h no ob@@ lation choos@@ eth a tree that will not ro@@ t ; he seek@@ eth un@@ to him a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man to prepare a Gra@@ ven image , that shall not be moved .
it is he that sit@@ te@@ th upon the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and the inhabitants there@@ of are as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; that stret@@ ch@@ eth out the heav@@ ens as a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th them out as a tent to d@@ well in :
that br@@ ing@@ eth the pr@@ inces to nothing ; he mak@@ eth the judges of the ear@@ th as van@@ ity .
why say@@ est th@@ ou , O Jac@@ o@@ b , and speak@@ est , O Israel , My way is hi@@ d from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God ?
he gi@@ vet@@ h power to the fa@@ int ; and to them that have no might he increas@@ eth strength .
even the you@@ ths shall fa@@ int and be we@@ ary , and the young men shall ut@@ ter@@ ly fall :
keep sil@@ ence before me , O islands ; and let the people ren@@ ew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
he pursu@@ ed them , and passed saf@@ ely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
who hat@@ h w@@ rought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? I the Lord , the first , and with the last ; I am he .
the is@@ les saw it , and fear@@ ed ; the ends of the ear@@ th were afraid , drew near , and came .
T@@ ho@@ u whom I have taken from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called the@@ e from the chief men there@@ of , and said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u art my ser@@ vant ; I have chosen the@@ e , and not cast the@@ e away .
be@@ hold , all they that were incen@@ sed against the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with the@@ e shall per@@ ish .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt seek them , and s@@ halt not find them , even them that conten@@ ded with the@@ e : they that war against the@@ e shall be as nothing , and as a thing of n@@ ought .
for I the Lord TH@@ Y God will hold TH@@ Y right hand , saying un@@ to the@@ e , Fe@@ ar not ; I will help the@@ e .
be@@ hold , I will make the@@ e a new sharp th@@ res@@ hing instrument having te@@ eth : th@@ ou s@@ halt th@@ res@@ h the mountains , and beat them small , and s@@ halt make the hil@@ ls as c@@ haf@@ f .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ at@@ ter them : and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord , and s@@ halt gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fo@@ un@@ tains in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s : I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
that they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of the Lord hat@@ h done this , and the Holy One of Israel hat@@ h created it .
She@@ w the things that are to come her@@ e@@ after , that we may know that ye are go@@ ds : ye@@ a , do good , or do ev@@ il , that we may be dis@@ may@@ ed , and be@@ hold it together .
be@@ hold , ye are of nothing , and your work of n@@ ought : an ab@@ omin@@ ation is he that choos@@ eth you .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon pr@@ inces as upon mor@@ ter , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter tre@@ ade@@ th cla@@ y .
the first shall say to Z@@ ion , be@@ hold , be@@ hold them : and I will give to Jer@@ usalem one that br@@ ing@@ eth good ti@@ dings .
for I be@@ held , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no coun@@ seller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
be@@ hold my ser@@ vant , whom I up@@ hold ; mine elect , in whom my sou@@ l deli@@ gh@@ te@@ th ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
he shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street .
a bru@@ ised Re@@ ed shall he not break , and the smoking fla@@ x shall he not qu@@ en@@ ch : he shall bring forth judgment un@@ to truth .
he shall not fail nor be dis@@ cour@@ aged , ti@@ ll he have set judgment in the ear@@ th : and the is@@ les shall wait for his law .
I the Lord have called the@@ e in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will hold th@@ ine hand , and will keep the@@ e , and give the@@ e for a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the people , for a light of the Gen@@ ti@@ les ;
to open the b@@ lin@@ d eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in d@@ ark@@ ness out of the prison house .
I am the Lord : that is my name : and my gl@@ ory will I not give to another , neither my praise to Gra@@ ven images .
be@@ hold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the cities there@@ of lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar do@@ th in@@ ha@@ bit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a m@@ igh@@ ty man , he shall stir up je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like a man of war : he shall cry , ye@@ a , ro@@ ar ; he shall prev@@ ail against his enem@@ ies .
I have long time hol@@ den my peace ; I have been still , and ref@@ ra@@ ined myself : now will I cry like a trav@@ ailing woman ; I will destroy and dev@@ our at once .
I will make waste mountains and hil@@ ls , and d@@ ry up all their her@@ bs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will d@@ ry up the po@@ ols .
they shall be turned back , they shall be greatly as@@ ha@@ med , that trust in Gra@@ ven images , that say to the m@@ ol@@ ten images , Y@@ e are our go@@ ds .
who is b@@ lin@@ d , but my ser@@ vant ? or de@@ af , as my mes@@ sen@@ ger that I sent ? who is b@@ lin@@ d as he that is perfect , and b@@ lin@@ d as the Lord 's ser@@ vant ?
the Lord is well pleased for his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ' sake ; he will mag@@ ni@@ fy the law , and make it honour@@ able .
who among you will give e@@ ar to this ? who will he@@ arken and hear for the time to come ?
but now thus sa@@ ith the Lord that created the@@ e , O Jac@@ o@@ b , and he that formed the@@ e , O Israel , Fe@@ ar not : for I have re@@ deemed the@@ e , I have called the@@ e by TH@@ Y name ; th@@ ou art mine .
for I am the Lord TH@@ Y God , the Holy One of Israel , TH@@ Y Sav@@ i@@ our : I gave Egypt for TH@@ Y ran@@ so@@ m , Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia and S@@ eb@@ a for the@@ e .
since th@@ ou w@@ ast pre@@ ci@@ ous in my sight , th@@ ou h@@ ast been honour@@ able , and I have lov@@ ed the@@ e : therefore will I give men for the@@ e , and people for TH@@ Y life .
fear not : for I am with the@@ e : I will bring TH@@ Y se@@ ed from the east , and gather the@@ e from the west ;
even every one that is called by my name : for I have created him for my gl@@ ory , I have formed him ; ye@@ a , I have made him .
I have declared , and have sav@@ ed , and I have she@@ wed , when there was no st@@ range go@@ d among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I am God .
Ye@@ a , before the day was I am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : I will work , and who shall let it ?
I am the Lord , your Holy One , the cre@@ ator of Israel , your King .
be@@ hold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , neither h@@ ast th@@ ou filled me with the f@@ at of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es : but th@@ ou h@@ ast made me to serve with TH@@ Y sin@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast we@@ ar@@ ied me with th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he that blo@@ tte@@ th out TH@@ Y trans@@ gres@@ sions for mine own sake , and will not remember TH@@ Y sin@@ s .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord that made the@@ e , and formed the@@ e from the w@@ om@@ b , which will help the@@ e ; Fe@@ ar not , O Jac@@ o@@ b , my ser@@ vant ; and th@@ ou , J@@ es@@ ur@@ un , whom I have chosen .
for I will p@@ our water upon him that is thir@@ st@@ y , and floods upon the d@@ ry ground : I will p@@ our my spirit upon TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and my b@@ les@@ sing upon th@@ ine off@@ spring :
and they shall spring up as among the gr@@ ass , as w@@ il@@ lows by the water courses .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord the King of Israel , and his re@@ de@@ e@@ mer the Lord of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and bes@@ ide me there is no God .
who hat@@ h formed a go@@ d , or m@@ ol@@ ten a Gra@@ ven image that is profitable for nothing ?
he he@@ w@@ eth him down c@@ ed@@ ars , and tak@@ eth the Cy@@ press and the o@@ ak , which he strength@@ en@@ eth for himself among the trees of the forest : he plan@@ te@@ th an ash , and the rain do@@ th no@@ ur@@ ish it .
they have not known nor understood : for he hat@@ h shut their eyes , that they can@@ not see ; and their hear@@ ts , that they can@@ not understand .
he fe@@ ede@@ th on ashes : a dec@@ e@@ ived heart hat@@ h turned him aside , that he can@@ not deliver his sou@@ l , nor say , Is there not a lie in my right hand ?
remember these , O Jac@@ o@@ b and Israel ; for th@@ ou art my ser@@ vant : I have formed the@@ e ; th@@ ou art my ser@@ vant : O Israel , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be forgotten of me .
I have blo@@ t@@ ted out , as a th@@ ick cl@@ oud , TH@@ Y trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cl@@ oud , TH@@ Y sin@@ s : return un@@ to me ; for I have re@@ deemed the@@ e .
I will go before the@@ e , and make the cro@@ oked places stra@@ ight : I will break in pieces the gates of br@@ ass , and cut in s@@ under the bars of iron :
and I will give the@@ e the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that th@@ ou may@@ est know that I , the Lord , which call the@@ e by TH@@ Y name , am the God of Israel .
for Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant 's sake , and Israel mine elect , I have even called the@@ e by TH@@ Y name : I have sur@@ named the@@ e , though th@@ ou h@@ ast not known me .
I am the Lord , and there is none else , there is no God bes@@ ide me : I gir@@ ded the@@ e , though th@@ ou h@@ ast not known me :
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none bes@@ ide me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
I form the light , and create d@@ ark@@ ness : I make peace , and create ev@@ il : I the Lord do all these things .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , and his Mak@@ er , As@@ k me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
I have made the ear@@ th , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens , and all their host have I comman@@ ded .
they shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and also con@@ founded , all of them : they shall go to conf@@ usion together that are makers of id@@ ols .
assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their Gra@@ ven image , and pra@@ y un@@ to a go@@ d that can@@ not save .
look un@@ to me , and be ye sav@@ ed , all the ends of the ear@@ th : for I am God , and there is none else .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my m@@ outh in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and shall not return , That un@@ to me every k@@ ne@@ e shall bo@@ w , every ton@@ gue shall swe@@ ar .
su@@ rely , shall one say , in the Lord have I righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incen@@ sed against him shall be as@@ ha@@ med .
they st@@ oo@@ p , they bo@@ w down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into cap@@ tivity .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the house of Israel , which are bor@@ ne by me from the bel@@ ly , which are carried from the w@@ om@@ b :
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ,
declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My coun@@ sel shall stand , and I will do all my pleas@@ ure :
come down , and sit in the d@@ ust , O vir@@ gin daughter of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sit on the ground : there is no th@@ r@@ one , O daughter of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : for th@@ ou s@@ halt no more be called tender and de@@ licate .
TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess shall be uncovered , ye@@ a , TH@@ Y sh@@ ame shall be seen : I will take ven@@ ge@@ ance , and I will not meet the@@ e as a man .
I was wro@@ th with my people , I have pollu@@ ted mine inher@@ it@@ ance , and given them into th@@ ine hand : th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st she@@ w them no mer@@ cy ; upon the ancient h@@ ast th@@ ou very heavily laid TH@@ Y yok@@ e .
and th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I shall be a la@@ dy for ever : so that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not lay these things to TH@@ Y heart , neither di@@ d@@ st remember the latter end of it .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast tr@@ usted in TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : th@@ ou h@@ ast said , N@@ one se@@ eth me . TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and TH@@ Y knowledge , it hat@@ h per@@ ver@@ ted the@@ e ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast said in th@@ ine heart , I am , and none else bes@@ ide me .
T@@ ho@@ u art we@@ ar@@ ied in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y coun@@ sels . let now the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the star@@ gaz@@ ers , the monthly pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic@@ ators , stand up , and save the@@ e from these things that shall come upon the@@ e .
thus shall they be un@@ to the@@ e with whom th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured , even TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts , from TH@@ Y youth : they shall w@@ ander every one to his quarter ; none shall save the@@ e .
for they call themselves of the hol@@ y city , and stay themselves upon the God of Israel ; The Lord of hosts is his name .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I she@@ wed them ; I did them su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and they came to pass .
because I knew that th@@ ou art ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate , and TH@@ Y nec@@ k is an iron sin@@ ew , and TH@@ Y bro@@ w br@@ ass ;
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ? I have she@@ wed the@@ e new things from this time , even hidden things , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not know them .
they are created now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when th@@ ou hear@@ dest them not ; lest th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , be@@ hold , I knew them .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou hear@@ dest not ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou k@@ newest not ; ye@@ a , from that time that th@@ ine e@@ ar was not opened : for I knew that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest deal very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and w@@ ast called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the w@@ om@@ b .
for my name 's sake will I def@@ er mine an@@ ger , and for my praise will I refrain for the@@ e , that I cut the@@ e not off .
be@@ hold , I have refin@@ ed the@@ e , but not with silver ; I have chosen the@@ e in the fur@@ n@@ ace of aff@@ li@@ ction .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be pollu@@ ted ? and I will not give my gl@@ ory un@@ to another .
mine hand also hat@@ h laid the foundation of the ear@@ th , and my right hand hat@@ h sp@@ an@@ ned the heav@@ ens : when I call un@@ to them , they stand up together .
I , even I , have spoken ; ye@@ a , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
O that th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st hear@@ ken@@ ed to my comman@@ d@@ ments ! then had TH@@ Y peace been as a river , and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the waves of the sea :
TH@@ Y se@@ ed also had been as the s@@ and , and the off@@ spring of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s like the gra@@ v@@ el there@@ of ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and they thir@@ s@@ ted not when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he cla@@ ve the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
listen , O is@@ les , un@@ to me ; and he@@ arken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hat@@ h called me from the w@@ om@@ b ; from the bo@@ wel@@ s of my mother hat@@ h he made mention of my name .
and he hat@@ h made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand hat@@ h he hi@@ d me , and made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver hat@@ h he hi@@ d me ;
they shall not hunger nor thir@@ st ; neither shall the heat nor sun sm@@ ite them : for he that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on them shall lead them , even by the spr@@ ings of water shall he guide them .
and I will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
be@@ hold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sin@@ im .
sing , O heav@@ ens ; and be jo@@ y@@ ful , O ear@@ th ; and break forth into singing , O mountains : for the Lord hat@@ h comfor@@ ted his people , and will have mer@@ cy upon his aff@@ lic@@ ted .
be@@ hold , I have Gra@@ ven the@@ e upon the pal@@ ms of my hands ; TH@@ Y walls are continu@@ ally before me .
TH@@ Y children shall make has@@ te ; TH@@ Y destro@@ yers and they that made the@@ e waste shall go forth of the@@ e .
for TH@@ Y waste and TH@@ Y de@@ so@@ late places , and the land of TH@@ Y destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that sw@@ allowed the@@ e up shall be far away .
the children which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , after th@@ ou h@@ ast lost the other , shall say again in th@@ ine e@@ ars , The place is too stra@@ it for me : give place to me that I may d@@ well .
shall the pre@@ y be taken from the m@@ igh@@ ty , or the law@@ ful cap@@ tive delivered ?
the Lord God hat@@ h opened mine e@@ ar , and I was not rebel@@ li@@ ous , neither turned away back .
I gave my back to the s@@ mit@@ ers , and my che@@ eks to them that p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir : I hi@@ d not my face from sh@@ ame and sp@@ it@@ ting .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be con@@ founded : therefore have I set my face like a F@@ lin@@ t , and I know that I shall not be as@@ ha@@ med .
he is near that justi@@ fi@@ eth me ; who will conten@@ d with me ? let us stand together : who is mine ad@@ versary ? let him come near to me .
be@@ hold , the Lord God will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wa@@ x old as a gar@@ ment ; the mo@@ th shall eat them up .
who is among you that fear@@ eth the Lord , that obe@@ yet@@ h the voice of his ser@@ vant , that walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hear@@ ken to me , ye that follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , ye that seek the Lord : look un@@ to the rock wh@@ ence ye are he@@ wn , and to the hol@@ e of the p@@ it wh@@ ence ye are dig@@ ged .
look un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham your father , and un@@ to Sar@@ ah that b@@ are you : for I called him alone , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and increased him .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , my people ; and give e@@ ar un@@ to me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is near ; my sal@@ vation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the is@@ les shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , ye that know righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the re@@ pro@@ ach of men , neither be ye afraid of their re@@ vil@@ ings .
for the mo@@ th shall eat them up like a gar@@ ment , and the wor@@ m shall eat them like wo@@ ol : but my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be for ever , and my sal@@ vation from generation to generation .
art th@@ ou not it which hat@@ h dri@@ ed the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hat@@ h made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the ran@@ so@@ med to pass over ?
therefore the re@@ deemed of the Lord shall return , and come with singing un@@ to Z@@ ion ; and ever@@ lasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gla@@ d@@ ness and joy ; and sor@@ row and mourning shall flee away .
the cap@@ tive ex@@ ile has@@ ten@@ eth that he may be lo@@ os@@ ed , and that he should not die in the p@@ it , nor that his bread should fail .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hat@@ h brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hat@@ h brought up .
these two things are come un@@ to the@@ e ; who shall be sor@@ ry for the@@ e ? de@@ so@@ lation , and destruction , and the fam@@ ine , and the s@@ word : by whom shall I comfor@@ t the@@ e ?
shake th@@ y@@ self from the d@@ ust ; arise , and sit down , O Jer@@ usalem : loose th@@ y@@ self from the bands of TH@@ Y nec@@ k , O cap@@ tive daughter of Z@@ ion .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , Y@@ e have sold yo@@ ur@@ selves for n@@ ought ; and ye shall be re@@ deemed without money .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that do@@ th speak : be@@ hold , it is I@@ .
TH@@ Y watch@@ men shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the Lord shall bring again Z@@ ion .
break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste places of Jer@@ usalem : for the Lord hat@@ h comfor@@ ted his people , he hat@@ h re@@ deemed Jer@@ usalem .
the Lord hat@@ h made b@@ are his hol@@ y arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the ear@@ th shall see the sal@@ vation of our God .
for ye shall not go out with has@@ te , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
as many were ast@@ on@@ ied at the@@ e ; his vis@@ age was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men :
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; the kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
who hat@@ h believed our report ? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ?
su@@ rely he hat@@ h bor@@ ne our gri@@ efs , and carried our sor@@ ro@@ ws : yet we did es@@ te@@ em him stric@@ ken , s@@ mit@@ ten of God , and aff@@ lic@@ ted .
all we like she@@ ep have gone as@@ tra@@ y ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the Lord hat@@ h laid on him the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of us all .
he was op@@ pressed , and he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , yet he opened not his m@@ outh : he is brought as a lam@@ b to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep before her s@@ hear@@ ers is dum@@ b , so he open@@ eth not his m@@ outh .
and he made his grave with the w@@ ic@@ ked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any dec@@ e@@ it in his m@@ outh .
he shall see of the trav@@ ail of his sou@@ l , and shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righ@@ te@@ ous ser@@ vant justify many ; for he shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
en@@ large the place of TH@@ Y tent , and let them stretch forth the cur@@ tains of th@@ ine habi@@ tations : spar@@ e not , leng@@ then TH@@ Y cor@@ ds , and strengthen TH@@ Y stakes ;
for th@@ ou s@@ halt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall inher@@ it the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and make the de@@ so@@ late cities to be inhabited .
for TH@@ Y Mak@@ er is th@@ ine husband ; the Lord of hosts is his name ; and TH@@ Y Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer the Holy One of Israel ; The God of the whole ear@@ th shall he be called .
in a little wr@@ ath I hi@@ d my face from the@@ e for a moment ; but with ever@@ lasting kin@@ d@@ ness will I have mer@@ cy on the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord TH@@ Y Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer .
for the mountains shall de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from the@@ e , neither shall the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the Lord that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the@@ e .
O th@@ ou aff@@ lic@@ ted , tos@@ sed with temp@@ est , and not comfor@@ ted , be@@ hold , I will lay TH@@ Y stones with fair c@@ olo@@ urs , and lay TH@@ Y foundations with sap@@ p@@ hi@@ res .
and I will make TH@@ Y windows of ag@@ ates , and TH@@ Y gates of car@@ bun@@ c@@ les , and all TH@@ Y borders of pleas@@ ant stones .
and all TH@@ Y children shall be ta@@ ught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of TH@@ Y children .
in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness s@@ halt th@@ ou be established : th@@ ou s@@ halt be far from op@@ pression ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near the@@ e .
be@@ hold , they shall su@@ rely gather together , but not by me : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall gather together against the@@ e shall fall for TH@@ Y sake .
be@@ hold , I have created the S@@ mit@@ h that b@@ low@@ eth the co@@ als in the fire , and that br@@ ing@@ eth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the was@@ ter to destroy .
H@@ o , every one that thir@@ ste@@ th , come ye to the waters , and he that hat@@ h no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; ye@@ a , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
be@@ hold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt call a nation that th@@ ou know@@ est not , and nations that knew not the@@ e shall run un@@ to the@@ e because of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hat@@ h gl@@ ori@@ fied the@@ e .
seek ye the Lord while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near :
for as the heav@@ ens are higher than the ear@@ th , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my th@@ ou@@ ghts than your th@@ ou@@ ghts .
so shall my word be that go@@ eth forth out of my m@@ outh : it shall not return un@@ to me vo@@ id , but it shall accomp@@ lish that which I ple@@ ase , and it shall prosp@@ er in the thing where@@ to I sent it .
neither let the son of the st@@ ran@@ ger , that hat@@ h joined himself to the Lord , speak , saying , The Lord hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly separated me from his people : neither let the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch say , be@@ hold , I am a d@@ ry tree .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord un@@ to the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that keep my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and choose the things that ple@@ ase me , and take hold of my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
the Lord God which gather@@ eth the out@@ casts of Israel sa@@ ith , Y@@ et will I gather others to him , bes@@ ide those that are gathered un@@ to him .
his watch@@ men are b@@ lin@@ d : they are all ignor@@ ant , they are all dum@@ b do@@ gs , they can@@ not bar@@ k ; sle@@ eping , lying down , lov@@ ing to s@@ lum@@ ber .
Ye@@ a , they are gre@@ edy do@@ gs which can never have enough , and they are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds that can@@ not understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
the righ@@ te@@ ous per@@ is@@ het@@ h , and no man lay@@ eth it to heart : and mer@@ ci@@ ful men are taken away , none considering that the righ@@ te@@ ous is taken away from the ev@@ il to come .
he shall enter into peace : they shall rest in their beds , each one walk@@ ing in his u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
upon a lo@@ f@@ ty and high mountain h@@ ast th@@ ou set TH@@ Y bed : even th@@ ither w@@ en@@ test th@@ ou up to offer sacrifice .
and th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test to the king with o@@ in@@ tment , and di@@ d@@ st increase TH@@ Y per@@ fu@@ mes , and di@@ d@@ st send TH@@ Y mes@@ sen@@ gers far off , and di@@ d@@ st de@@ base th@@ y@@ self even un@@ to hell .
T@@ ho@@ u art we@@ ar@@ ied in the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y way ; yet sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou not , There is no hope : th@@ ou h@@ ast found the life of th@@ ine hand ; therefore th@@ ou w@@ ast not gri@@ ev@@ ed .
for I will not conten@@ d for ever , neither will I be always wro@@ th : for the spirit should fail before me , and the so@@ ul@@ s which I have made .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness was I wro@@ th , and smo@@ te him : I hi@@ d me , and was wro@@ th , and he went on fro@@ war@@ dly in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the li@@ ps ; Peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , sa@@ ith the Lord ; and I will he@@ al him .
cry al@@ oud , spar@@ e not , lift up TH@@ Y voice like a tr@@ ump@@ et , and she@@ w my people their trans@@ gres@@ sion , and the house of Jac@@ o@@ b their sin@@ s .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have we fas@@ ted , say they , and th@@ ou se@@ est not ? where@@ fore have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and th@@ ou tak@@ est no knowledge ? be@@ hold , in the day of your fast ye find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ bour@@ s .
be@@ hold , ye fast for stri@@ fe and debate , and to sm@@ ite with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
then shall TH@@ Y light break forth as the morning , and th@@ ine health shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y : and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before the@@ e ; the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall be TH@@ Y r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
and if th@@ ou draw out TH@@ Y sou@@ l to the hun@@ gry , and satisfy the aff@@ lic@@ ted sou@@ l ; then shall TH@@ Y light rise in ob@@ sc@@ urity , and TH@@ Y d@@ ark@@ ness be as the no@@ on@@ day :
be@@ hold , the Lord 's hand is not shor@@ tened , that it can@@ not save ; neither his e@@ ar heavy , that it can@@ not hear :
but your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have separated between you and your God , and your sin@@ s have hi@@ d his face from you , that he will not hear .
for your hands are def@@ iled with blood , and your fin@@ gers with in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; your li@@ ps have spoken lies , your ton@@ gue hat@@ h mut@@ tered per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess .
none cal@@ le@@ th for justice , nor any ple@@ ade@@ th for truth : they trust in van@@ ity , and speak lies ; they conce@@ ive mis@@ chief , and bring forth in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
their feet run to ev@@ il , and they make h@@ ast to shed innocent blood : their th@@ ou@@ ghts are th@@ ou@@ ghts of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; was@@ ting and destruction are in their p@@ aths .
the way of peace they know not ; and there is no judgment in their go@@ ings : they have made them cro@@ oked p@@ aths : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever go@@ eth there@@ in shall not know peace .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the b@@ lin@@ d , and we gro@@ pe as if we had no eyes : we st@@ um@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the night ; we are in de@@ so@@ late places as dead men .
we ro@@ ar all like be@@ ars , and mour@@ n sor@@ e like d@@ ov@@ es : we look for judgment , but there is none ; for sal@@ vation , but it is far off from us .
for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are multi@@ p@@ lied before the@@ e , and our sin@@ s testify against us : for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are with us ; and as for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , we know them ;
in trans@@ g@@ ressing and lying against the Lord , and depar@@ ting away from our God , speaking op@@ pression and revol@@ t , conce@@ i@@ ving and ut@@ tering from the heart words of fal@@ se@@ hood .
Ye@@ a , truth fail@@ eth ; and he that depar@@ te@@ th from ev@@ il mak@@ eth himself a pre@@ y : and the Lord saw it , and it disp@@ le@@ ased him that there was no judgment .
and he saw that there was no man , and won@@ dered that there was no inter@@ c@@ essor : therefore his arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to him ; and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , it sustained him .
for he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an hel@@ met of sal@@ vation upon his head ; and he put on the gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a clo@@ ke .
according to their de@@ eds , accor@@ d@@ ingly he will repay , fur@@ y to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , re@@ comp@@ ence to his enem@@ ies ; to the islands he will repay re@@ comp@@ ence .
arise , sh@@ ine ; for TH@@ Y light is come , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord is risen upon the@@ e .
for , be@@ hold , the d@@ ark@@ ness shall cover the ear@@ th , and gross d@@ ark@@ ness the people : but the Lord shall arise upon the@@ e , and his gl@@ ory shall be seen upon the@@ e .
and the Gen@@ ti@@ les shall come to TH@@ Y light , and kings to the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of TH@@ Y rising .
the multi@@ tude of ca@@ me@@ ls shall cover the@@ e , the dro@@ med@@ aries of Mi@@ dian and Ep@@ ha@@ h ; all they from She@@ ba shall come : they shall bring gold and incen@@ se ; and they shall she@@ w forth the pra@@ ises of the Lord .
therefore TH@@ Y gates shall be open continu@@ ally ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring un@@ to the@@ e the forces of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and that their kings may be brought .
the gl@@ ory of Lebanon shall come un@@ to the@@ e , the f@@ ir tree , the p@@ ine tree , and the box together , to be@@ auti@@ fy the place of my sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; and I will make the place of my feet g@@ lor@@ ious .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also su@@ ck the milk of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and s@@ halt su@@ ck the bre@@ ast of kings : and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I the Lord am TH@@ Y Sav@@ i@@ our and TH@@ Y Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b .
violence shall no more be heard in TH@@ Y land , was@@ ting nor destruction within TH@@ Y borders ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt call TH@@ Y walls sal@@ vation , and TH@@ Y gates P@@ raise .
the sun shall be no more TH@@ Y light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light un@@ to the@@ e : but the Lord shall be un@@ to the@@ e an ever@@ lasting light , and TH@@ Y God TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
TH@@ Y sun shall no more go down ; neither shall TH@@ Y moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be th@@ ine ever@@ lasting light , and the days of TH@@ Y mourning shall be ended .
TH@@ Y people also shall be all righ@@ te@@ ous : they shall inher@@ it the land for ever , the branch of my plan@@ ting , the work of my hands , that I may be gl@@ ori@@ fied .
and they shall build the old was@@ tes , they shall raise up the former de@@ so@@ lations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the de@@ so@@ lations of many generations .
and st@@ ran@@ gers shall stand and fe@@ ed your f@@ loc@@ ks , and the sons of the ali@@ en shall be your p@@ low@@ men and your vin@@ ed@@ res@@ s@@ ers .
but ye shall be named the pri@@ ests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and in their gl@@ ory shall ye bo@@ ast yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for your sh@@ ame ye shall have double ; and for conf@@ usion they shall re@@ jo@@ ice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall poss@@ ess the double : ever@@ lasting joy shall be un@@ to them .
and their se@@ ed shall be known among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and their off@@ spring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the se@@ ed which the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness there@@ of go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and the sal@@ vation there@@ of as a lam@@ p that bur@@ net@@ h .
and the Gen@@ ti@@ les shall see TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and all kings TH@@ Y gl@@ ory : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be called by a new name , which the m@@ outh of the Lord shall name .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also be a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal di@@ ade@@ m in the hand of TH@@ Y God .
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my hol@@ iness .
go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h proclaimed un@@ to the end of the world , S@@ ay ye to the daughter of Z@@ ion , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y sal@@ vation co@@ me@@ th ; be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
for the day of ven@@ ge@@ ance is in mine heart , and the year of my re@@ deemed is come .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I won@@ dered that there was none to up@@ hold : therefore mine own arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to me ; and my fur@@ y , it up@@ held me .
and I will tre@@ ad down the people in mine an@@ ger , and make them dr@@ un@@ k in my fur@@ y , and I will bring down their strength to the ear@@ th .
but they rebel@@ led , and v@@ ex@@ ed his hol@@ y Spiri@@ t : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he fought against them .
as a be@@ ast go@@ eth down into the val@@ ley , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caused him to rest : so di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou lead TH@@ Y people , to make th@@ y@@ self a g@@ lor@@ ious name .
look down from heav@@ en , and be@@ hold from the habi@@ tation of TH@@ Y hol@@ iness and of TH@@ Y gl@@ ory : where is TH@@ Y z@@ e@@ al and TH@@ Y strength , the so@@ unding of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s and of TH@@ Y mer@@ cies toward me ? are they re@@ strained ?
doub@@ t@@ less th@@ ou art our father , though Ab@@ ra@@ ham be ignor@@ ant of us , and Israel acknowledge us not : th@@ ou , O Lord , art our father , our re@@ de@@ e@@ mer ; TH@@ Y name is from ever@@ lasting .
O Lord , why h@@ ast th@@ ou made us to er@@ r from TH@@ Y ways , and har@@ dened our heart from TH@@ Y fear ? return for TH@@ Y servants ' sake , the tri@@ bes of th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance .
the people of TH@@ Y hol@@ iness have poss@@ essed it but a little while : our ad@@ vers@@ aries have tro@@ dden down TH@@ Y sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
we are th@@ ine : th@@ ou never bar@@ est rule over them ; they were not called by TH@@ Y name .
when th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ter@@ ri@@ ble things which we looked not for , th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st down , the mountains flow@@ ed down at TH@@ Y presence .
T@@ ho@@ u me@@ e@@ test him that re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth and wor@@ ket@@ h righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those that remember the@@ e in TH@@ Y ways : be@@ hold , th@@ ou art wro@@ th ; for we have sin@@ ned : in those is continu@@ ance , and we shall be sav@@ ed .
but we are all as an un@@ clean thing , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses are as fil@@ thy ra@@ gs ; and we all do fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , have taken us away .
but now , O Lord , th@@ ou art our father ; we are the cla@@ y , and th@@ ou our P@@ ot@@ ter ; and we all are the work of TH@@ Y hand .
be not wro@@ th very sor@@ e , O Lord , neither remember in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity for ever : be@@ hold , see , we bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , we are all TH@@ Y people .
our hol@@ y and our beautiful house , where our fa@@ thers praised the@@ e , is burned up with fire : and all our pleas@@ ant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , be@@ hold me , be@@ hold me , un@@ to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day un@@ to a rebel@@ li@@ ous people , which walk@@ eth in a way that was not good , after their own th@@ ou@@ ghts ;
which remain among the graves , and lo@@ dge in the monuments , which eat sw@@ ine 's f@@ les@@ h , and bro@@ th of ab@@ omin@@ able things is in their vessels ;
which say , St@@ and by th@@ y@@ self , come not near to me ; for I am hol@@ ier than th@@ ou . these are a smoke in my n@@ ose , a fire that bur@@ net@@ h all the day .
and I will bring forth a se@@ ed out of Jac@@ o@@ b , and out of Ju@@ da@@ h an inher@@ it@@ or of my mountains : and mine elect shall inher@@ it it , and my servants shall d@@ well there .
but ye are they that for@@ sake the Lord , that forget my hol@@ y mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that fur@@ nish the drink offering un@@ to that number .
be@@ hold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sor@@ row of heart , and shall ho@@ w@@ l for v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
and ye shall leave your name for a cur@@ se un@@ to my chosen : for the Lord God shall s@@ lay the@@ e , and call his servants by another name :
but be ye glad and re@@ jo@@ ice for ever in that which I create : for , be@@ hold , I create Jer@@ usalem a re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , and her people a joy .
and I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of we@@ eping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of cr@@ ying .
and they shall build houses , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not labour in v@@ ain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the se@@ ed of the b@@ les@@ sed of the Lord , and their off@@ spring with them .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , The heav@@ en is my th@@ r@@ one , and the ear@@ th is my foot@@ st@@ ool : where is the house that ye build un@@ to me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
a voice of no@@ ise from the city , a voice from the temp@@ le , a voice of the Lord that ren@@ der@@ eth re@@ comp@@ ence to his enem@@ ies .
before she trav@@ ailed , she brought forth ; before her p@@ ain came , she was delivered of a man child .
re@@ jo@@ ice ye with Jer@@ usalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : re@@ jo@@ ice for joy with her , all ye that mour@@ n for her :
that ye may su@@ ck , and be satisfied with the bre@@ asts of her con@@ so@@ lations ; that ye may milk out , and be deli@@ gh@@ ted with the ab@@ und@@ ance of her gl@@ ory .
as one whom his mother comfor@@ te@@ th , so will I comfor@@ t you ; and ye shall be comfor@@ ted in Jer@@ usalem .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord will come with fire , and with his char@@ i@@ ots like a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , to ren@@ der his an@@ ger with fur@@ y , and his re@@ bu@@ ke with fla@@ mes of fire .
for by fire and by his s@@ word will the Lord p@@ lead with all f@@ les@@ h : and the sla@@ in of the Lord shall be many .
for I know their works and their th@@ ou@@ ghts : it shall come , that I will gather all nations and ton@@ gues ; and they shall come , and see my gl@@ ory .
for as the new heav@@ ens and the new ear@@ th , which I will make , shall remain before me , sa@@ ith the Lord , so shall your se@@ ed and your name remain .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath to another , shall all f@@ les@@ h come to worship before me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , of the pri@@ ests that were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the thir@@ teen@@ th year of his reign .
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
before I formed the@@ e in the bel@@ ly I knew the@@ e ; and before th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth out of the w@@ om@@ b I sanc@@ ti@@ fied the@@ e , and I or@@ da@@ ined the@@ e a pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to the nations .
but the Lord said un@@ to me , S@@ ay not , I am a child : for th@@ ou s@@ halt go to all that I shall send the@@ e , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I command the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt speak .
then the Lord put forth his hand , and touched my m@@ outh . and the Lord said un@@ to me , be@@ hold , I have put my words in TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
see , I have this day set the@@ e over the nations and over the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying , Jerem@@ i@@ ah , what se@@ est th@@ ou ? and I said , I see a ro@@ d of an al@@ mond tree .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me the second time , saying , What se@@ est th@@ ou ? and I said , I see a se@@ eth@@ ing po@@ t ; and the face there@@ of is toward the north .
then the Lord said un@@ to me , O@@ ut of the north an ev@@ il shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
and I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , who have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the works of their own hands .
T@@ ho@@ u therefore gir@@ d up TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , and arise , and speak un@@ to them all that I command the@@ e : be not dis@@ may@@ ed at their faces , lest I con@@ found the@@ e before them .
and they shall fight against the@@ e ; but they shall not prev@@ ail against the@@ e ; for I am with the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord , to deliver the@@ e .
moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and all the families of the house of Israel :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , What in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity have your fa@@ thers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after van@@ ity , and are become v@@ ain ?
and I brought you into a plen@@ ti@@ ful country , to eat the fruit there@@ of and the Go@@ od@@ ness there@@ of ; but when ye entered , ye def@@ iled my land , and made mine heritage an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
be ast@@ on@@ ished , O ye heav@@ ens , at this , and be hor@@ ri@@ bly afraid , be ye very de@@ so@@ late , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for my people have committed two ev@@ ils ; they have for@@ sak@@ en me the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters , and he@@ wed them out c@@ ister@@ ns , broken c@@ ister@@ ns , that can hold no water .
is Israel a ser@@ vant ? is he a home@@ born sla@@ ve ? why is he sp@@ o@@ iled ?
also the children of N@@ op@@ h and Ta@@ hap@@ an@@ es have broken the cro@@ wn of TH@@ Y head .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not proc@@ ured this un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , in that th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ sak@@ en the Lord TH@@ Y God , when he led the@@ e by the way ?
yet I had plan@@ ted the@@ e a no@@ ble v@@ ine , wh@@ ol@@ ly a right se@@ ed : how then art th@@ ou turned into the de@@ generate plant of a st@@ range v@@ ine un@@ to me ?
a wild ass used to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleas@@ ure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not we@@ ary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
as the th@@ i@@ ef is as@@ ha@@ med when he is found , so is the house of Israel as@@ ha@@ med ; they , their kings , their pr@@ inces , and their pri@@ ests , and their pro@@ ph@@ ets ,
but where are TH@@ Y go@@ ds that th@@ ou h@@ ast made the@@ e ? let them arise , if they can save the@@ e in the time of TH@@ Y trouble : for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities are TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h .
in v@@ ain have I s@@ mit@@ ten your children ; they received no correc@@ tion : your own s@@ word hat@@ h dev@@ oured your pro@@ ph@@ ets , like a destroying lion .
can a ma@@ id forget her or@@ nam@@ ents , or a bri@@ de her at@@ tire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
why tri@@ m@@ me@@ st th@@ ou TH@@ Y way to seek love ? therefore h@@ ast th@@ ou also ta@@ ught the w@@ ic@@ ked ones TH@@ Y ways .
also in TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts is found the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the poor inno@@ cents : I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
yet th@@ ou say@@ est , Bec@@ ause I am innocent , su@@ rely his an@@ ger shall turn from me . be@@ hold , I will p@@ lead with the@@ e , because th@@ ou say@@ est , I have not sin@@ ned .
why g@@ ad@@ dest th@@ ou about so much to change TH@@ Y way ? th@@ ou also s@@ halt be as@@ ha@@ med of Egypt , as th@@ ou w@@ ast as@@ ha@@ med of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth from him , and th@@ ine hands upon th@@ ine head : for the Lord hat@@ h rejected TH@@ Y confi@@ den@@ ces , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not prosp@@ er in them .
therefore the sho@@ wers have been with@@ hol@@ den , and there hat@@ h been no latter rain ; and th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st a wh@@ ore 's fore@@ head , th@@ ou ref@@ us@@ ed@@ st to be as@@ ha@@ med .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou not from this time cry un@@ to me , My father , th@@ ou art the guide of my youth ?
and I said after she had done all these things , Tur@@ n th@@ ou un@@ to me . but she returned not . and her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h saw it .
and it came to pass through the ligh@@ t@@ ness of her wh@@ ore@@ dom , that she def@@ iled the land , and committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with stones and with sto@@ cks .
only acknowledge th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that th@@ ou h@@ ast trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord TH@@ Y God , and h@@ ast sc@@ at@@ tered TH@@ Y ways to the st@@ ran@@ gers under every green tree , and ye have not obe@@ yed my voice , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and I will give you p@@ ast@@ ors according to mine heart , which shall fe@@ ed you with knowledge and understanding .
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
a voice was heard upon the high places , we@@ eping and supp@@ lic@@ ations of the children of Israel : for they have per@@ ver@@ ted their way , and they have forgotten the Lord their God .
return , ye back@@ sli@@ ding children , and I will he@@ al your back@@ s@@ lid@@ ings . be@@ hold , we come un@@ to the@@ e ; for th@@ ou art the Lord our God .
truly in v@@ ain is sal@@ vation hoped for from the hil@@ ls , and from the multi@@ tude of mountains : truly in the Lord our God is the sal@@ vation of Israel .
for sh@@ ame hat@@ h dev@@ oured the labour of our fa@@ thers from our youth ; their f@@ loc@@ ks and their her@@ ds , their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt swe@@ ar , The Lord li@@ vet@@ h , in truth , in judgment , and in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; and the nations shall b@@ less themselves in him , and in him shall they gl@@ ory .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord to the men of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , Bre@@ ak up your f@@ allow ground , and so@@ w not among thor@@ ns .
declare ye in Ju@@ da@@ h , and publish in Jer@@ usalem ; and say , blow ye the tr@@ ump@@ et in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , and let us go into the def@@ enced cities .
for this gir@@ d you with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , la@@ ment and ho@@ w@@ l : for the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord is not turned back from us .
be@@ hold , he shall come up as cl@@ ou@@ ds , and his char@@ i@@ ots shall be as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : his hor@@ ses are swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les . Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! for we are sp@@ o@@ iled .
O Jer@@ usalem , was@@ h th@@ ine heart from w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , that th@@ ou may@@ est be sav@@ ed . how long shall TH@@ Y v@@ ain th@@ ou@@ ghts lo@@ dge within the@@ e ?
make ye mention to the nations ; be@@ hold , publish against Jer@@ usalem , that wat@@ chers come from a far country , and give out their voice against the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
as ke@@ epers of a field , are they against her round about ; because she hat@@ h been rebel@@ li@@ ous against me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
destruction upon destruction is cri@@ ed ; for the whole land is sp@@ o@@ iled : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly are my ten@@ ts sp@@ o@@ iled , and my cur@@ tains in a moment .
for my people is fo@@ ol@@ ish , they have not known me ; they are so@@ tti@@ sh children , and they have none understanding : they are wise to do ev@@ il , but to do good they have no knowledge .
I be@@ held the ear@@ th , and , lo , it was without form , and vo@@ id ; and the heav@@ ens , and they had no light .
I be@@ held the mountains , and , lo , they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and all the hil@@ ls moved lightly .
I be@@ held , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heav@@ ens were fled .
I be@@ held , and , lo , the fruit@@ ful place was a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and all the cities there@@ of were broken down at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce an@@ ger .
for this shall the ear@@ th mour@@ n , and the heav@@ ens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have pur@@ posed it , and will not rep@@ ent , neither will I turn back from it .
therefore I said , su@@ rely these are poor ; they are fo@@ ol@@ ish : for they know not the way of the Lord , nor the judgment of their God .
they were as f@@ ed hor@@ ses in the morning : every one neigh@@ ed after his neighbour 's wife .
shall I not visit for these things ? sa@@ ith the Lord : and shall not my sou@@ l be av@@ en@@ ged on such a nation as this ?
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her batt@@ lements ; for they are not the Lord 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have dealt very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously against me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done un@@ to them .
hear now this , O fo@@ ol@@ ish people , and without understanding ; which have eyes , and see not ; which have e@@ ars , and hear not :
your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have turned away these things , and your sin@@ s have with@@ hol@@ den good things from you .
for among my people are found w@@ ic@@ ked men : they lay wait , as he that set@@ te@@ th s@@ nar@@ es ; they set a tra@@ p , they catch men .
as a c@@ age is full of birds , so are their houses full of dec@@ e@@ it : therefore they are become great , and wa@@ x@@ en rich .
the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y fal@@ sely , and the pri@@ ests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end there@@ of ?
the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds with their f@@ loc@@ ks shall come un@@ to her ; they shall pit@@ ch their ten@@ ts against her round about ; they shall fe@@ ed every one in his place .
and their houses shall be turned un@@ to others , with their fields and wi@@ ves together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for from the least of them even un@@ to the greatest of them every one is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
they have he@@ aled also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
also I set watch@@ men over you , saying , Hear@@ ken to the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et . but they said , We will not he@@ arken .
hear , O ear@@ th : be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this people , even the fruit of their th@@ ou@@ ghts , because they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
to what purpose co@@ me@@ th there to me incen@@ se from She@@ ba , and the swe@@ et can@@ e from a far country ? your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings are not acceptable , nor your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es swe@@ et un@@ to me .
we have heard the f@@ ame there@@ of : our hands wa@@ x fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish hat@@ h taken hold of us , and p@@ ain , as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the s@@ word of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gir@@ d the@@ e with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and w@@ allow th@@ y@@ self in ashes : make the@@ e mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lament@@ ation : for the sp@@ o@@ iler shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come upon us .
I have set the@@ e for a to@@ wer and a fortress among my people , that th@@ ou may@@ est know and try their way .
the bel@@ lows are burned , the lead is consu@@ med of the fire ; the founder mel@@ te@@ th in v@@ ain : for the w@@ ic@@ ked are not p@@ lu@@ cked away .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
stand in the gate of the Lord 's house , and procla@@ im there this word , and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , all ye of Ju@@ da@@ h , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
trust ye not in lying words , saying , The temp@@ le of the Lord , The temp@@ le of the Lord , The temp@@ le of the Lord , are these .
for if ye throug@@ h@@ ly amend your ways and your do@@ ings ; if ye throug@@ h@@ ly exec@@ ute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
if ye op@@ press not the st@@ ran@@ ger , the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other go@@ ds to your hurt :
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , for ever and ever .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of rob@@ bers in your eyes ? be@@ hold , even I have seen it , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but go ye now un@@ to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the Lord , and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answ@@ ered not ;
therefore will I do un@@ to this house , which is called by my name , where@@ in ye trust , and un@@ to the place which I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , as I have done to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
and I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your bre@@ th@@ ren , even the whole se@@ ed of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
Se@@ est th@@ ou not what they do in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
do they prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger ? sa@@ ith the Lord : do they not prov@@ oke themselves to the conf@@ usion of their own faces ?
for I sp@@ ake not un@@ to your fa@@ thers , nor comman@@ ded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
but they hear@@ ken@@ ed not , nor inc@@ lined their e@@ ar , but walked in the coun@@ sels and in the imag@@ ination of their ev@@ il heart , and went back@@ ward , and not forward .
yet they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to me , nor inc@@ lined their e@@ ar , but har@@ dened their nec@@ k : they did worse than their fa@@ thers .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt speak all these words un@@ to them ; but they will not he@@ arken to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt also call un@@ to them ; but they will not answer the@@ e .
for the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done ev@@ il in my sight , sa@@ ith the Lord : they have set their ab@@ omin@@ ations in the house which is called by my name , to poll@@ ute it .
and the car@@ cases of this people shall be meat for the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and for the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th ; and none shall fra@@ y them away .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due of them that remain of this ev@@ il family , which remain in all the places w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
I hear@@ ken@@ ed and heard , but they sp@@ ake not ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ted him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? every one turned to his course , as the hor@@ se rus@@ het@@ h into the battle .
Ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heav@@ en know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the cr@@ ane and the sw@@ allow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ? L@@ o , certainly in v@@ ain made he it ; the p@@ en of the s@@ cri@@ bes is in v@@ ain .
the wise men are as@@ ha@@ med , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wis@@ dom is in them ?
for they have he@@ aled the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of health , and be@@ hold trouble !
for , be@@ hold , I will send Ser@@ pen@@ ts , co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ces , among you , which will not be char@@ med , and they shall bi@@ te you , sa@@ ith the Lord .
when I would comfor@@ t myself against sor@@ row , my heart is fa@@ int in me .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment hat@@ h taken hold on me .
is there no bal@@ m in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; is there no physi@@ cian there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
O@@ h that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fo@@ un@@ tain of te@@ ars , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sla@@ in of the daughter of my people !
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
and they b@@ end their ton@@ gues like their bo@@ w for lies : but they are not val@@ i@@ ant for the truth upon the ear@@ th ; for they proceed from ev@@ il to ev@@ il , and they know not me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
take ye heed every one of his neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will ut@@ ter@@ ly sup@@ plant , and every neighbour will walk with s@@ lan@@ ders .
and they will dec@@ e@@ ive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have ta@@ ught their ton@@ gue to speak lies , and we@@ ary themselves to commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , be@@ hold , I will mel@@ t them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
their ton@@ gue is as an ar@@ row shot out ; it speak@@ eth dec@@ e@@ it : one speak@@ eth peac@@ e@@ ably to his neighbour with his m@@ outh , but in heart he lay@@ eth his wait .
and I will make Jer@@ usalem he@@ aps , and a den of dra@@ g@@ ons ; and I will make the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h de@@ so@@ late , without an inhabi@@ tant .
and the Lord sa@@ ith , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en my law which I set before them , and have not obe@@ yed my voice , neither walked there@@ in ;
but have walked after the imag@@ ination of their own heart , and after Ba@@ al@@ im , which their fa@@ thers ta@@ ught them :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the he@@ a@@ then , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known : and I will send a s@@ word after them , ti@@ ll I have consu@@ med them .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for c@@ un@@ ning women , that they may come :
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for a voice of w@@ ailing is heard out of Z@@ ion , Ho@@ w are we sp@@ o@@ iled ! we are greatly con@@ founded , because we have for@@ sak@@ en the land , because our d@@ wel@@ lings have cast us out .
yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your e@@ ar receive the word of his m@@ outh , and te@@ ach your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters w@@ ailing , and every one her neighbour lament@@ ation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our pal@@ aces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will punish all them which are circum@@ c@@ ised with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ;
hear ye the word which the Lord speak@@ eth un@@ to you , O house of Israel :
for the customs of the people are v@@ ain : for one cut@@ te@@ th a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man , with the ax@@ e .
they dec@@ k it with silver and with gold ; they fas@@ ten it with n@@ ails and with ham@@ mers , that it move not .
For@@ as@@ much as there is none like un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord ; th@@ ou art great , and TH@@ Y name is great in might .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and pur@@ ple is their clo@@ thing : they are all the work of c@@ un@@ ning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting king : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his in@@ dign@@ ation .
thus shall ye say un@@ to them , The go@@ ds that have not made the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th , even they shall per@@ ish from the ear@@ th , and from under these heav@@ ens .
he hat@@ h made the ear@@ th by his power , he hat@@ h established the world by his wis@@ dom , and hat@@ h stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens by his discre@@ tion .
every man is bru@@ tish in his knowledge : every founder is con@@ founded by the Gra@@ ven image : for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
they are van@@ ity , and the work of err@@ ors : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall per@@ ish .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the ro@@ d of his inher@@ it@@ ance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will s@@ ling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will dist@@ ress them , that they may find it so .
Wo@@ e is me for my hurt ! my wo@@ und is gri@@ ev@@ ous : but I said , T@@ rul@@ y this is a gri@@ ef , and I must bear it .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is sp@@ o@@ iled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for the p@@ ast@@ ors are become bru@@ tish , and have not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosp@@ er , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks shall be sc@@ at@@ tered .
be@@ hold , the no@@ ise of the bru@@ it is come , and a great commo@@ tion out of the north country , to make the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h de@@ so@@ late , and a den of dra@@ g@@ ons .
O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walk@@ eth to direct his steps .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
hear ye the words of this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and speak un@@ to the men of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem ;
and say th@@ ou un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel ; Cur@@ sed be the man that obe@@ yet@@ h not the words of this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and the Lord said un@@ to me , A con@@ spir@@ acy is found among the men of Ju@@ da@@ h , and among the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem .
then shall the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem go , and cry un@@ to the go@@ ds un@@ to whom they offer incen@@ se : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities were TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have ye set up al@@ tar@@ s to that sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
therefore pra@@ y not th@@ ou for this people , neither lift up a cry or pray@@ er for them : for I will not hear them in the time that they cry un@@ to me for their trouble .
the Lord called TH@@ Y name , A green olive tree , fair , and of good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , that seek TH@@ Y life , saying , Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y not in the name of the Lord , that th@@ ou die not by our hand :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the s@@ word ; their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall die by fam@@ ine :
and there shall be no re@@ mn@@ ant of them : for I will bring ev@@ il upon the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast plan@@ ted them , ye@@ a , they have taken root : they grow , ye@@ a , they bring forth fruit : th@@ ou art near in their m@@ outh , and far from their re@@ ins .
for even TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and the house of TH@@ Y father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with the@@ e ; ye@@ a , they have called a multi@@ tude after the@@ e : believe them not , though they speak fair words un@@ to the@@ e .
I have for@@ sak@@ en mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed of my sou@@ l into the hand of her enem@@ ies .
mine heritage is un@@ to me as a lion in the forest ; it cri@@ eth out against me : therefore have I ha@@ ted it .
many p@@ ast@@ ors have destroyed my v@@ ine@@ yard , they have tro@@ dden my portion under fo@@ ot , they have made my pleas@@ ant portion a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
they have made it de@@ so@@ late , and being de@@ so@@ late it mour@@ net@@ h un@@ to me ; the whole land is made de@@ so@@ late , because no man lay@@ eth it to heart .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers are come upon all high places through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for the s@@ word of the Lord shall dev@@ our from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h shall have peace .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them out I will return , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
so I got a gir@@ dle according to the word of the Lord , and put it on my lo@@ ins .
take the gir@@ dle that th@@ ou h@@ ast got , which is upon TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , and arise , go to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and hide it there in a hol@@ e of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , go to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and take the gir@@ dle from th@@ ence , which I comman@@ ded the@@ e to hide there .
then I went to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and dig@@ ged , and took the gir@@ dle from the place where I had hi@@ d it : and , be@@ hold , the gir@@ dle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fa@@ thers and the sons together , sa@@ ith the Lord : I will not p@@ ity , nor spar@@ e , nor have mer@@ cy , but destroy them .
but if ye will not hear it , my sou@@ l shall we@@ ep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall we@@ ep sor@@ e , and run down with te@@ ars , because the Lord 's flock is carried away cap@@ tive .
say un@@ to the king and to the qu@@ een , hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , sit down : for your princip@@ alities shall come down , even the cro@@ wn of your gl@@ ory .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Ju@@ da@@ h shall be carried away cap@@ tive all of it , it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
lift up your eyes , and be@@ hold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given the@@ e , TH@@ Y beautiful flock ?
what w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou say when he shall punish the@@ e ? for th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught them to be cap@@ tains , and as chief over the@@ e : shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take the@@ e , as a woman in trav@@ ail ?
and if th@@ ou say in th@@ ine heart , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore come these things upon me ? for the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity are TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts discovered , and TH@@ Y he@@ els made b@@ are .
can the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian change his s@@ kin , or the Le@@ op@@ ard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are acc@@ ust@@ o@@ med to do ev@@ il .
therefore will I sc@@ at@@ ter them as the st@@ ub@@ ble that pass@@ eth away by the wind of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
this is TH@@ Y lot , the portion of TH@@ Y measures from me , sa@@ ith the Lord ; because th@@ ou h@@ ast forgotten me , and tr@@ usted in fal@@ se@@ hood .
therefore will I discover TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts upon TH@@ Y face , that TH@@ Y sh@@ ame may appear .
the word of the Lord that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning the de@@ ar@@ th .
and their no@@ bles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the p@@ its , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded , and covered their heads .
because the ground is chap@@ t , for there was no rain in the ear@@ th , the p@@ low@@ men were as@@ ha@@ med , they covered their heads .
Ye@@ a , the h@@ ind also cal@@ ved in the field , and for@@ so@@ ok it , because there was no gr@@ ass .
and the wild ass@@ es did stand in the high places , they sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ed up the wind like dra@@ g@@ ons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no gr@@ ass .
we acknowledge , O Lord , our w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of our fa@@ thers : for we have sin@@ ned against the@@ e .
do not ab@@ h@@ or us , for TH@@ Y name 's sake , do not dis@@ grace the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y gl@@ ory : remember , break not TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with us .
and I will cause them to be removed into all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
TH@@ Y sub@@ stance and TH@@ Y treasures will I give to the sp@@ oil without price , and that for all TH@@ Y sin@@ s , even in all TH@@ Y borders .
I sat not in the assembly of the mo@@ c@@ kers , nor re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed ; I sat alone because of TH@@ Y hand : for th@@ ou h@@ ast filled me with in@@ dign@@ ation .
why is my p@@ ain perpet@@ ual , and my wo@@ und inc@@ ur@@ able , which ref@@ us@@ eth to be he@@ aled ? w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou be altogether un@@ to me as a li@@ ar , and as waters that fail ?
and I will deliver the@@ e out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and I will re@@ de@@ em the@@ e out of the hand of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
the word of the Lord came also un@@ to me , saying ,
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that b@@ are them , and concerning their fa@@ thers that beg@@ at them in this land ;
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men la@@ ment for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bal@@ d for them :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not also go into the house of fe@@ asting , to sit with them to eat and to drink .
and ye have done worse than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , ye walk every one after the imag@@ ination of his ev@@ il heart , that they may not he@@ arken un@@ to me :
for mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hi@@ d from my face , neither is their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity hi@@ d from mine eyes .
and first I will re@@ compen@@ se their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double ; because they have def@@ iled my land , they have filled mine inher@@ it@@ ance with the car@@ cases of their de@@ te@@ stable and ab@@ omin@@ able things .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The Lord .
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is Gra@@ ven upon the table of their heart , and upon the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good co@@ me@@ th ; but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
I the Lord search the heart , I try the re@@ ins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ te@@ th on eg@@ gs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ te@@ th ri@@ ches , and not by right , shall leave them in the mid@@ st of his days , and at his end shall be a fo@@ ol .
a g@@ lor@@ ious high th@@ r@@ one from the beginning is the place of our sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that for@@ sake the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and they that de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters .
be not a terror un@@ to me : th@@ ou art my hope in the day of ev@@ il .
and say un@@ to them , He@@ ar ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and all Ju@@ da@@ h , and all the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; T@@ ake heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , and bear no burden on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , neither do ye any work , but hal@@ low ye the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , as I comman@@ ded your fa@@ thers .
but they obe@@ yed not , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar , but made their nec@@ k sti@@ ff , that they might not hear , nor receive in@@ struction .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
arise , and go down to the P@@ ot@@ ter 's house , and there I will cause the@@ e to hear my words .
then I went down to the P@@ ot@@ ter 's house , and , be@@ hold , he w@@ rought a work on the whe@@ els .
and the ves@@ sel that he made of cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter : so he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
O house of Israel , can@@ not I do with you as this P@@ ot@@ ter ? sa@@ ith the Lord . be@@ hold , as the cla@@ y is in the P@@ ot@@ ter 's hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
at what in@@ stan@@ t I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a k@@ ing@@ dom , to p@@ lu@@ ck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do un@@ to them .
and at what in@@ stan@@ t I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a k@@ ing@@ dom , to build and to plant it ;
if it do ev@@ il in my sight , that it obe@@ y not my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , where@@ with I said I would benefit them .
and they said , There is no hope : but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imag@@ ination of his ev@@ il heart .
will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which co@@ me@@ th from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flow@@ ing waters that come from another place be for@@ sak@@ en ?
because my people hat@@ h forgotten me , they have burned incen@@ se to van@@ ity , and they have caused them to st@@ um@@ ble in their ways from the ancient p@@ aths , to walk in p@@ aths , in a way not cast up ;
to make their land de@@ so@@ late , and a perpet@@ ual his@@ sing ; every one that pass@@ eth there@@ by shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and wa@@ g his head .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will she@@ w them the back , and not the face , in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
give heed to me , O Lord , and he@@ arken to the voice of them that conten@@ d with me .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when th@@ ou s@@ halt bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them : for they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , G@@ o and get a P@@ ot@@ ter 's ear@@ then bot@@ tle , and take of the an@@ ci@@ ents of the people , and of the an@@ ci@@ ents of the pri@@ ests ;
and go forth un@@ to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the east gate , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell the@@ e ,
they have built also the high places of Ba@@ al , to bur@@ n their sons with fire for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to Ba@@ al , which I comman@@ ded not , nor sp@@ ake it , neither came it into my mind :
and I will make this city de@@ so@@ late , and an his@@ sing ; every one that pass@@ eth there@@ by shall be ast@@ on@@ ished and his@@ s because of all the plagu@@ es there@@ of .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou break the bot@@ tle in the sight of the men that go with the@@ e ,
thus will I do un@@ to this place , sa@@ ith the Lord , and to the inhabitants there@@ of , and even make this city as Top@@ he@@ t :
then came Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Top@@ he@@ t , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord had sent him to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
now P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Im@@ mer the pri@@ est , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jerem@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied these things .
then P@@ ash@@ ur smo@@ te Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that P@@ ash@@ ur brought forth Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the sto@@ cks . then said Jerem@@ i@@ ah un@@ to him , The Lord hat@@ h not called TH@@ Y name P@@ ash@@ ur , but Mag@@ or @@@ -@@ @ mis@@ sa@@ bi@@ b .
for since I sp@@ ake , I cri@@ ed out , I cri@@ ed violence and sp@@ oil ; because the word of the Lord was made a re@@ pro@@ ach un@@ to me , and a der@@ ision , daily .
but the Lord is with me as a m@@ igh@@ ty ter@@ ri@@ ble one : therefore my persec@@ ut@@ ors shall st@@ um@@ ble , and they shall not prev@@ ail : they shall be greatly as@@ ha@@ med ; for they shall not prosp@@ er : their ever@@ lasting conf@@ usion shall never be forgotten .
but , O Lord of hosts , that tri@@ est the righ@@ te@@ ous , and se@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see TH@@ Y ven@@ ge@@ ance on them : for un@@ to the@@ e have I opened my cause .
sing un@@ to the Lord , praise ye the Lord : for he hat@@ h delivered the sou@@ l of the poor from the hand of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers .
Cur@@ sed be the day where@@ in I was born : let not the day where@@ in my mother b@@ are me be b@@ les@@ sed .
Cur@@ sed be the man who brought ti@@ dings to my father , saying , A man child is born un@@ to the@@ e ; making him very glad .
and let that man be as the cities which the Lord over@@ threw , and re@@ pen@@ ted not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the sh@@ ou@@ ting at no@@ on@@ ti@@ de ;
because he sle@@ w me not from the w@@ om@@ b ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her w@@ om@@ b to be always great with me .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore came I forth out of the w@@ om@@ b to see labour and sor@@ row , that my days should be consu@@ med with sh@@ ame ?
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , when king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah sent un@@ to him P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Mel@@ chi@@ ah , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , saying ,
and I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stret@@ ched hand and with a strong arm , even in an@@ ger , and in fur@@ y , and in great wr@@ ath .
and I will sm@@ ite the inhabitants of this city , both man and be@@ ast : they shall die of a great p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
and tou@@ ching the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , say , He@@ ar ye the word of the Lord ;
be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and rock of the pla@@ in , sa@@ ith the Lord ; which say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , sa@@ ith the Lord : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in the forest there@@ of , and it shall dev@@ our all things round about it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; G@@ o down to the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and speak there this word ,
and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , O king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sit@@ test upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y servants , and TH@@ Y people that enter in by these gates :
and I will prepare destro@@ yers against the@@ e , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down TH@@ Y choice c@@ ed@@ ars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this great city ?
but he shall die in the place w@@ hi@@ ther they have led him cap@@ tive , and shall see this land no more .
Wo@@ e un@@ to him that buil@@ de@@ th his house by un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and his ch@@ ambers by wrong ; that us@@ eth his neighbour 's service without wages , and gi@@ vet@@ h him not for his work ;
but th@@ ine eyes and th@@ ine heart are not but for TH@@ Y c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for op@@ pression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the bur@@ ial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
I sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e in TH@@ Y prosperity ; but th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I will not hear . this hat@@ h been TH@@ Y manner from TH@@ Y youth , that th@@ ou obe@@ yed@@ st not my voice .
the wind shall eat up all TH@@ Y p@@ ast@@ ors , and TH@@ Y lov@@ ers shall go into cap@@ tivity : su@@ rely then s@@ halt th@@ ou be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded for all TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
and I will give the@@ e into the hand of them that seek TH@@ Y life , and into the hand of them whose face th@@ ou fear@@ est , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
and I will cast the@@ e out , and TH@@ Y mother that b@@ are the@@ e , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken i@@ dol ? is he a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure ? where@@ fore are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all countries w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and increase .
and I will set up she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds over them which shall fe@@ ed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , neither shall they be lacking , sa@@ ith the Lord .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will raise un@@ to David a righ@@ te@@ ous Bran@@ ch , and a King shall reign and prosp@@ er , and shall exec@@ ute judgment and justice in the ear@@ th .
in his days Ju@@ da@@ h shall be sav@@ ed , and Israel shall d@@ well saf@@ ely : and this is his name where@@ by he shall be called , the Lord our R@@ IG@@ H@@ TE@@ O@@ U@@ SN@@ ESS .
for the land is full of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of swe@@ aring the land mour@@ net@@ h ; the pleas@@ ant places of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness are dri@@ ed up , and their course is ev@@ il , and their force is not right .
for both pro@@ phe@@ t and pri@@ est are prof@@ ane ; ye@@ a , in my house have I found their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , sa@@ ith the Lord .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore their way shall be un@@ to them as sli@@ p@@ per@@ y ways in the d@@ ark@@ ness : they shall be driven on , and fall there@@ in : for I will bring ev@@ il upon them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and I have seen Fol@@ ly in the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Samar@@ ia ; they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in Ba@@ al , and caused my people Israel to er@@ r .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all : for from the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Jer@@ usalem is prof@@ an@@ eness gone forth into all the land .
for who hat@@ h stood in the coun@@ sel of the Lord , and hat@@ h perceived and heard his word ? who hat@@ h marked his word , and heard it ?
be@@ hold , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of the Lord is gone forth in fur@@ y , even a gri@@ ev@@ ous wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it shall fall gri@@ ev@@ ously upon the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and ti@@ ll he have performed the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
how long shall this be in the heart of the pro@@ ph@@ ets that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y lies ? ye@@ a , they are pro@@ ph@@ ets of the dec@@ e@@ it of their own heart ;
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dre@@ ams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fa@@ thers have forgotten my name for Ba@@ al .
the pro@@ phe@@ t that hat@@ h a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hat@@ h my word , let him speak my word fa@@ ith@@ fully . what is the c@@ haf@@ f to the wheat ? sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore , be@@ hold , I am against the pro@@ ph@@ ets , sa@@ ith the Lord , that ste@@ al my words every one from his neighbour .
and as for the pro@@ phe@@ t , and the pri@@ est , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the Lord , I will even punish that man and his house .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hat@@ h the Lord answ@@ ered ? and , What hat@@ h the Lord spoken ?
and the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have per@@ ver@@ ted the words of the living God , of the Lord of hosts our God .
and I will bring an ever@@ lasting re@@ pro@@ ach upon you , and a perpet@@ ual sh@@ ame , which shall not be forgotten .
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , even like the fig@@ s that are first ri@@ pe : and the other bas@@ ket had very na@@ ug@@ h@@ ty fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
and I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , ti@@ ll they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave un@@ to them and to their fa@@ thers .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
the which Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t sp@@ ake un@@ to all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
and the Lord hat@@ h sent un@@ to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear .
and go not after other go@@ ds to serve them , and to worship them , and prov@@ oke me not to an@@ ger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the cand@@ le .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will re@@ compen@@ se them according to their de@@ eds , and according to the works of their own hands .
and they shall drink , and be moved , and be ma@@ d , because of the s@@ word that I will send among them .
then took I the c@@ up at the Lord 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , un@@ to whom the Lord had sent me :
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and all his people ;
and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Az@@ z@@ ah , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and all the kings of Z@@ id@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ les which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the min@@ g@@ led people that d@@ well in the de@@ sert ,
and all the kings of Z@@ im@@ ri , and all the kings of E@@ lam , and all the kings of the Me@@ des ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are upon the face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the c@@ up at th@@ ine hand to drink , then s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Y@@ e shall certainly drink .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , be@@ hold , ev@@ il shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and an ho@@ w@@ ling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled their pas@@ ture .
and the peac@@ eable habi@@ tations are cut down because of the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h came this word from the Lord , saying ,
if so be they will he@@ arken , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way , that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il , which I purpose to do un@@ to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to he@@ arken to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I sent un@@ to you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed ;
so the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people heard Jerem@@ i@@ ah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house un@@ to the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
then sp@@ ake Jerem@@ i@@ ah un@@ to all the pr@@ inces and to all the people , saying , The Lord sent me to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obe@@ y the voice of the Lord your God ; and the Lord will rep@@ ent him of the ev@@ il that he hat@@ h pronounced against you .
then said the pr@@ inces and all the people un@@ to the pri@@ ests and to the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; This man is not wor@@ thy to die : for he hat@@ h spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God .
then rose up certain of the el@@ ders of the land , and sp@@ ake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king sent men into Egypt , name@@ ly , El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
nevertheless the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h came this word un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
and command them to say un@@ to their mas@@ ters , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say un@@ to your mas@@ ters ;
I have made the ear@@ th , the man and the be@@ ast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and have given it un@@ to whom it seemed meet un@@ to me .
and now have I given all these lands un@@ to the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the be@@ asts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
and all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie un@@ to you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should per@@ ish .
I sp@@ ake also to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h according to all these words , saying , Br@@ ing your nec@@ ks under the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and serve him and his people , and live .
therefore he@@ arken not un@@ to the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ets that speak un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie un@@ to you .
Ye@@ a , thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and of Jer@@ usalem ;
they shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , sa@@ ith the Lord ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
thus speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried them to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
nevertheless hear th@@ ou now this word that I speak in th@@ ine e@@ ars , and in the e@@ ars of all the people ;
the pro@@ ph@@ ets that have been before me and before the@@ e of old pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied both against many countries , and against great k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , of war , and of ev@@ il , and of p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
the pro@@ phe@@ t which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth of peace , when the word of the pro@@ phe@@ t shall come to pass , then shall the pro@@ phe@@ t be known , that the Lord hat@@ h truly sent him .
then Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t took the yok@@ e from off the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah 's nec@@ k , and br@@ ake it .
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the yok@@ e from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will cast the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th : this year th@@ ou s@@ halt die , because th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught rebel@@ lion against the Lord .
( after that J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the king , and the qu@@ een , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and the car@@ pen@@ ters , and the S@@ mi@@ ths , were depar@@ ted from Jer@@ usalem ; )
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , un@@ to all that are carried away cap@@ tives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
build ye houses , and d@@ well in them ; and plant gar@@ den@@ s , and eat the fruit of them ;
and seek the peace of the city w@@ hi@@ ther I have caused you to be carried away cap@@ tives , and pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord for it : for in the peace there@@ of shall ye have peace .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , That after sev@@ enty years be accomplished at Bab@@ yl@@ on I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pra@@ y un@@ to me , and I will he@@ arken un@@ to you .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
because they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to my words , sa@@ ith the Lord , which I sent un@@ to them by my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , sa@@ ith the Lord .
hear ye therefore the word of the Lord , all ye of the cap@@ tivity , whom I have sent from Jer@@ usalem to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
thus s@@ halt th@@ ou also speak to Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the Ne@@ he@@ lam@@ ite , saying ,
now therefore why h@@ ast th@@ ou not re@@ proved Jerem@@ i@@ ah of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , which mak@@ eth himself a pro@@ phe@@ t to you ?
for therefore he sent un@@ to us in Bab@@ yl@@ on , saying , This cap@@ tivity is long : build ye houses , and d@@ well in them ; and plant gar@@ den@@ s , and eat the fruit of them .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
thus speak@@ eth the Lord God of Israel , saying , W@@ r@@ ite the@@ e all the words that I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e in a book .
and these are the words that the Lord sp@@ ake concerning Israel and concerning Ju@@ da@@ h .
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and will bur@@ st TH@@ Y bonds , and st@@ ran@@ gers shall no more serve themselves of him :
but they shall serve the Lord their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up un@@ to them .
there is none to p@@ lead TH@@ Y cause , that th@@ ou may@@ est be bound up : th@@ ou h@@ ast no he@@ aling medicin@@ es .
why cri@@ est th@@ ou for th@@ ine aff@@ li@@ ction ? TH@@ Y sor@@ row is inc@@ ur@@ able for the multi@@ tude of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because TH@@ Y sin@@ s were increased , I have done these things un@@ to the@@ e .
and out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of them that make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
their children also shall be as af@@ ore@@ time , and their Con@@ gre@@ gation shall be established before me , and I will punish all that op@@ press them .
be@@ hold , the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of the Lord go@@ eth forth with fur@@ y , a continuing wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it shall fall with p@@ ain upon the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
the Lord hat@@ h appeared of old un@@ to me , saying , Ye@@ a , I have lov@@ ed the@@ e with an ever@@ lasting love : therefore with lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness have I drawn the@@ e .
again I will build the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : th@@ ou s@@ halt again be ad@@ or@@ ned with TH@@ Y tab@@ re@@ ts , and s@@ halt go forth in the dan@@ ces of them that make mer@@ ry .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt yet plant v@@ ines upon the mountains of Samar@@ ia : the plan@@ ters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
for there shall be a day , that the watch@@ men upon the mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall cry , arise ye , and let us go up to Z@@ ion un@@ to the Lord our God .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; sing with gla@@ d@@ ness for Jac@@ o@@ b , and sh@@ out among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O Lord , save TH@@ Y people , the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel .
for the Lord hat@@ h re@@ deemed Jac@@ o@@ b , and ran@@ so@@ med him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
and I will s@@ ati@@ ate the sou@@ l of the pri@@ ests with fat@@ ness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Go@@ od@@ ness , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and there is hope in th@@ ine end , sa@@ ith the Lord , that TH@@ Y children shall come again to their own border .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I smo@@ te upon my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , ye@@ a , even con@@ founded , because I did bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
set the@@ e up w@@ ay@@ marks , make the@@ e high he@@ aps : set th@@ ine heart toward the highway , even the way which th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test : turn again , O vir@@ gin of Israel , turn again to these TH@@ Y cities .
how long w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou go about , O th@@ ou back@@ sli@@ ding daughter ? for the Lord hat@@ h created a new thing in the ear@@ th , A woman shall comp@@ ass a man .
and there shall d@@ well in Ju@@ da@@ h itself , and in all the cities there@@ of together , hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , and they that go forth with f@@ loc@@ ks .
upon this I aw@@ aked , and be@@ held ; and my sle@@ ep was swe@@ et un@@ to me .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of be@@ ast .
in those days they shall say no more , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten a s@@ our gra@@ pe , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : every man that e@@ ate@@ th the s@@ our gra@@ pe , his te@@ eth shall be set on edge .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
if those ord@@ inan@@ ces de@@ part from before me , sa@@ ith the Lord , then the se@@ ed of Israel also shall ce@@ ase from being a nation before me for ever .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; If heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , I will also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , sa@@ ith the Lord .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that the city shall be built to the Lord from the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el un@@ to the gate of the cor@@ ner .
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill G@@ are@@ b , and shall comp@@ ass about to Go@@ ath .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord in the tenth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , which was the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar .
for then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and he shall lead Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and there shall he be until I visit him , sa@@ ith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , ye shall not prosp@@ er ?
be@@ hold , Han@@ ame@@ el the son of S@@ hal@@ lum th@@ ine un@@ cle shall come un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Bu@@ y the@@ e my field that is in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th : for the right of re@@ dem@@ ption is th@@ ine to buy it .
and I bought the field of Han@@ ame@@ el my un@@ cle 's son , that was in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , and weighed him the money , even se@@ ven@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els of silver .
and I subscri@@ bed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balan@@ ces .
so I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and cust@@ om , and that which was open :
now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , I pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , saying ,
A@@ h Lord God ! be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast made the heav@@ en and the ear@@ th by TH@@ Y great power and stret@@ ched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for the@@ e :
T@@ ho@@ u she@@ west lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to thousands , and re@@ compens@@ est the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers into the bos@@ om of their children after them : the Great , the m@@ igh@@ ty God , the Lord of hosts , is his name ,
which h@@ ast set signs and won@@ ders in the land of Egypt , even un@@ to this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and h@@ ast made the@@ e a name , as at this day ;
and h@@ ast brought forth TH@@ Y people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with great terror ;
and h@@ ast given them this land , which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st swe@@ ar to their fa@@ thers to give them , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ;
and th@@ ou h@@ ast said un@@ to me , O Lord God , Bu@@ y the@@ e the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
be@@ hold , I am the Lord , the God of all f@@ les@@ h : is there any thing too hard for me ?
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have only done ev@@ il before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
but they set their ab@@ omin@@ ations in the house , which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
Ye@@ a , I will re@@ jo@@ ice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ red@@ ly with my whole heart and with my whole sou@@ l .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; L@@ ike as I have brought all this great ev@@ il upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them .
and fields shall be bought in this land , where@@ of ye say , It is de@@ so@@ late without man or be@@ ast ; it is given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord the maker there@@ of , the Lord that formed it , to establish it ; the Lord is his name ;
call un@@ to me , and I will answer the@@ e , and she@@ w the@@ e great and m@@ igh@@ ty things , which th@@ ou know@@ est not .
and I will cause the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and the cap@@ tivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
and I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned , and where@@ by they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; A@@ gain in this place , which is de@@ so@@ late without man and without be@@ ast , and in all the cities there@@ of , shall be an habi@@ tation of she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds causing their f@@ loc@@ ks to lie down .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised un@@ to the house of Israel and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those days , and at that time , will I cause the Bran@@ ch of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness to grow up un@@ to David ; and he shall exec@@ ute judgment and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness in the land .
in those days shall Ju@@ da@@ h be sav@@ ed , and Jer@@ usalem shall d@@ well saf@@ ely : and this is the name where@@ with she shall be called , The Lord our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of the house of Israel ;
neither shall the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes want a man before me to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and to kin@@ dle meat offer@@ ings , and to do sacrifice continu@@ ally .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
as the host of heav@@ en can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed , neither the s@@ and of the sea meas@@ ured : so will I multi@@ ply the se@@ ed of David my ser@@ vant , and the L@@ evi@@ tes that minister un@@ to me .
moreover the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
yet hear the word of the Lord , O Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not die by the s@@ word :
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t sp@@ ake all these words un@@ to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h in Jer@@ usalem ,
this is the word that came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people which were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty un@@ to them ;
but after@@ ward they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
therefore the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
then I took Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ az@@ in@@ i@@ ah , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes ;
and I set before the sons of the house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes po@@ ts full of wine , and c@@ ups , and I said un@@ to them , Dr@@ ink ye wine .
thus have we obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b our father in all that he hat@@ h charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , nor our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
nor to build houses for us to d@@ well in : neither have we v@@ ine@@ yard , nor field , nor se@@ ed :
but we have d@@ wel@@ t in ten@@ ts , and have obe@@ yed , and done according to all that Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b our father comman@@ ded us .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b have performed the comman@@ d@@ ment of their father , which he comman@@ ded them ; but this people hat@@ h not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me :
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do un@@ to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah : and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken un@@ to him , upon a rol@@ l of a book .
and Jerem@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded Bar@@ u@@ ch , saying , I am shut up ; I can@@ not go into the house of the Lord :
and Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah did according to all that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t comman@@ ded him , reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house .
when Micha@@ i@@ ah the son of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
then Micha@@ i@@ ah declared un@@ to them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ u@@ ch read the book in the e@@ ars of the people .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the rol@@ l in the chamber of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
now the king sat in the w@@ inter@@ house in the ninth month : and there was a fire on the Hear@@ th burning before him .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their gar@@ ments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
nevertheless El@@ na@@ than and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah had made inter@@ c@@ ession to the king that he would not bur@@ n the rol@@ l : but he would not hear them .
but the king comman@@ ded Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el the son of Ham@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Az@@ ri@@ el , and She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of Ab@@ de@@ el , to take Bar@@ u@@ ch the s@@ cri@@ be and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t : but the Lord hi@@ d them .
then the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the rol@@ l , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
take the@@ e again another rol@@ l , and write in it all the former words that were in the first rol@@ l , which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h burned .
and king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah re@@ ig@@ ned instead of Con@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made king in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did he@@ arken un@@ to the words of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king sent J@@ eh@@ u@@ cal the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est to the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying , pra@@ y now un@@ to the Lord our God for us .
now Jerem@@ i@@ ah came in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison .
then P@@ har@@ o@@ ah 's army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chal@@ de@@ ans that bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem heard ti@@ dings of them , they depar@@ ted from Jer@@ usalem .
then came the word of the Lord un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and bur@@ n it with fire .
for though ye had s@@ mit@@ ten the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
when Jerem@@ i@@ ah was entered into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on , and into the cab@@ ins , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah had remained there many days ;
moreover Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , What have I off@@ ended against the@@ e , or against TH@@ Y servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
where are now your pro@@ ph@@ ets which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to you , saying , The king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch went forth out of the king 's house , and sp@@ ake to the king , saying ,
and E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian said un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , P@@ ut now these old cast cl@@ outs and rot@@ ten ra@@ gs under th@@ ine arm@@ ho@@ les under the cor@@ ds . and Jerem@@ i@@ ah did so .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , If I declare it un@@ to the@@ e , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou not su@@ rely put me to death ? and if I give the@@ e coun@@ sel , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou not he@@ arken un@@ to me ?
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver the@@ e . obe@@ y , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the voice of the Lord , which I speak un@@ to the@@ e : so it shall be well un@@ to the@@ e , and TH@@ Y sou@@ l shall live .
but if th@@ ou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the Lord hat@@ h she@@ wed me :
so Jerem@@ i@@ ah abo@@ de in the court of the prison until the day that Jer@@ usalem was taken : and he was there when Jer@@ usalem was taken .
in the ninth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on and all his army against Jer@@ usalem , and they bes@@ e@@ ig@@ ed it .
and in the ele@@ venth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in R@@ ib@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w all the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h .
moreover he put out Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah 's eyes , and bound him with cha@@ ins , to carry him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and br@@ ake down the walls of Jer@@ usalem .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
now Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on gave charge concerning Jerem@@ i@@ ah to Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard , saying ,
so Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard sent , and N@@ eb@@ us@@ has@@ ban , Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ sar@@ is , and Ner@@ gal @@@ -@@ @ shar@@ ez@@ er , R@@ ab@@ ma@@ g , and all the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces ;
even they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
now the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
but I will deliver the@@ e in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not be given into the hand of the men of whom th@@ ou art afraid .
for I will su@@ rely deliver the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not fall by the s@@ word , but TH@@ Y life shall be for a pre@@ y un@@ to the@@ e : because th@@ ou h@@ ast put TH@@ Y trust in me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the captain of the guard took Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and said un@@ to him , The Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h pronounced this ev@@ il upon this place .
now the Lord hat@@ h brought it , and done according as he hat@@ h said : because ye have sin@@ ned against the Lord , and have not obe@@ yed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
then went Jerem@@ i@@ ah un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and d@@ wel@@ t with him among the people that were left in the land .
even all the Jews returned out of all places w@@ hi@@ ther they were driven , and came to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , un@@ to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and gathered wine and summer fru@@ its very much .
moreover Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were in the fields , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ,
and said un@@ to him , D@@ ost th@@ ou certainly know that Ba@@ al@@ is the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites hat@@ h sent I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah to s@@ lay the@@ e ? but G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am believed them not .
but G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am said un@@ to Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not do this thing : for th@@ ou speak@@ est fal@@ sely of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also sle@@ w all the Jews that were with him , even with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it came to pass the second day after he had sla@@ in G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , and no man knew it ,
and it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el had carried away cap@@ tive from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah cast about and returned , and went un@@ to Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah .
but I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah escaped from Johan@@ an with eight men , and went to the Am@@ mon@@ ites .
that the Lord TH@@ Y God may she@@ w us the way where@@ in we may walk , and the thing that we may do .
then they said to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , The Lord be a true and fa@@ ith@@ ful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall send the@@ e to us .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel , un@@ to whom ye sent me to present your supp@@ lic@@ ation before him ;
and I will she@@ w mer@@ cies un@@ to you , that he may have mer@@ cy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
but if ye say , We will not d@@ well in this land , neither obe@@ y the voice of the Lord your God ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , in the place w@@ hi@@ ther ye desire to go and to so@@ jour@@ n .
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah set@@ te@@ th the@@ e on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , that were returned from all nations , w@@ hi@@ ther they had been driven , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
then came the word of the Lord un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , saying ,
take great stones in th@@ ine hand , and hide them in the cla@@ y in the bri@@ ck@@ kil@@ n , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and when he co@@ me@@ th , he shall sm@@ ite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity ; and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
he shall break also the images of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , that is in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the go@@ ds of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall he bur@@ n with fire .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I sent un@@ to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them , saying , O@@ h , do not this ab@@ omin@@ able thing that I h@@ ate .
but they hear@@ ken@@ ed not , nor inc@@ lined their e@@ ar to turn from their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , to bur@@ n no incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore my fur@@ y and mine an@@ ger was p@@ oured forth , and was kin@@ d@@ led in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ; and they are was@@ ted and de@@ so@@ late , as at this day .
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even un@@ to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will set my face against you for ev@@ il , and to cut off all Ju@@ da@@ h .
for I will punish them that d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
as for the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken un@@ to us in the name of the Lord , we will not he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
moreover Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , and to all the women , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , all Ju@@ da@@ h that are in the land of Egypt :
and this shall be a sign un@@ to you , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall su@@ rely stand against you for ev@@ il :
the word of the Lord which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t against the Gen@@ ti@@ les ;
against Egypt , against the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
har@@ ness the hor@@ ses ; and get up , ye hor@@ se@@ men , and stand forth with your hel@@ me@@ ts ; fur@@ b@@ ish the spe@@ ars , and put on the bri@@ g@@ and@@ ines .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have I seen them dis@@ may@@ ed and turned away back ? and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and are fled Ap@@ ace , and look not back : for fear was round about , sa@@ ith the Lord .
let not the swift flee away , nor the m@@ igh@@ ty man escape ; they shall st@@ um@@ ble , and fall toward the north by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
who is this that co@@ me@@ th up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
Egypt ris@@ eth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he sa@@ ith , I will go up , and will cover the ear@@ th ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants there@@ of .
come up , ye hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , ye char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men come forth ; the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians and the Lib@@ y@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ di@@ ans , that handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
go up into G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and take bal@@ m , O vir@@ gin , the daughter of Egypt : in v@@ ain s@@ halt th@@ ou use many medicin@@ es ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be cu@@ red .
the nations have heard of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , and TH@@ Y cry hat@@ h filled the land : for the m@@ igh@@ ty man hat@@ h stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the Lord sp@@ ake to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , how Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on should come and sm@@ ite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Mig@@ dol , and publish in N@@ op@@ h and in Tah@@ pan@@ hes : say ye , St@@ and fast , and prepare the@@ e ; for the s@@ word shall dev@@ our round about the@@ e .
they did cry there , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt is but a no@@ ise ; he hat@@ h passed the time appointed .
Egypt is like a very fair he@@ if@@ er , but destruction co@@ me@@ th ; it co@@ me@@ th out of the north .
the voice there@@ of shall go like a ser@@ p@@ ent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with ax@@ es , as he@@ wers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , sa@@ ith the Lord , though it can@@ not be searched ; because they are more than the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , and are in@@ num@@ er@@ able .
the daughter of Egypt shall be con@@ founded ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the word of the Lord that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , before that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h smo@@ te Gaza .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong hor@@ ses , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , and at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers shall not look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
O th@@ ou s@@ word of the Lord , how long will it be ER@@ E th@@ ou be quiet ? put up th@@ y@@ self into TH@@ Y sc@@ ab@@ bar@@ d , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , seeing the Lord hat@@ h given it a charge against Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and against the sea shore ? there hat@@ h he appointed it .
Mo@@ a@@ b is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
for in the going up of Lu@@ hit@@ h contin@@ ual we@@ eping shall go up ; for in the going down of Hor@@ on@@ aim the enem@@ ies have heard a cry of destruction .
for because th@@ ou h@@ ast tr@@ usted in TH@@ Y works and in TH@@ Y treasures , th@@ ou s@@ halt also be taken : and Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h shall go forth into cap@@ tivity with his pri@@ ests and his pr@@ inces together .
and the sp@@ o@@ iler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the val@@ ley also shall per@@ ish , and the pla@@ in shall be destroyed , as the Lord hat@@ h spoken .
give w@@ ings un@@ to Mo@@ a@@ b , that it may flee and get away : for the cities there@@ of shall be de@@ so@@ late , without any to d@@ well there@@ in .
Cur@@ sed be he that do@@ eth the work of the Lord dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully , and Cur@@ sed be he that keep@@ eth back his s@@ word from blood .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will send un@@ to him w@@ ander@@ ers , that shall cause him to w@@ ander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les .
and Mo@@ a@@ b shall be as@@ ha@@ med of Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h , as the house of Israel was as@@ ha@@ med of Be@@ the@@ l their confidence .
Mo@@ a@@ b is sp@@ o@@ iled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the sla@@ ughter , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts .
all ye that are about him , b@@ emo@@ an him ; and all ye that know his name , say , Ho@@ w is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful ro@@ d !
T@@ ho@@ u daughter that dost in@@ ha@@ bit Di@@ bon , come down from TH@@ Y gl@@ ory , and sit in thir@@ st ; for the sp@@ o@@ iler of Mo@@ a@@ b shall come upon the@@ e , and he shall destroy TH@@ Y strong holds .
Mo@@ a@@ b is con@@ founded ; for it is broken down : ho@@ w@@ l and cry ; and tell ye it in Ar@@ non , that Mo@@ a@@ b is sp@@ o@@ iled ,
and judgment is come upon the pla@@ in country ; upon Hol@@ on , and upon Ja@@ haz@@ ah , and upon M@@ ep@@ ha@@ ath ,
the Hor@@ n of Mo@@ a@@ b is cut off , and his arm is broken , sa@@ ith the Lord .
make ye him dr@@ un@@ ken : for he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself against the Lord : Mo@@ a@@ b also shall w@@ allow in his v@@ om@@ it , and he also shall be in der@@ ision .
for was not Israel a der@@ ision un@@ to the@@ e ? was he found among th@@ i@@ ev@@ es ? for since th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est of him , th@@ ou sk@@ ip@@ p@@ ed@@ st for joy .
O ye that d@@ well in Mo@@ a@@ b , leave the cities , and d@@ well in the rock , and be like the do@@ ve that mak@@ eth her n@@ est in the sides of the hol@@ e 's m@@ outh .
I know his wr@@ ath , sa@@ ith the Lord ; but it shall not be so ; his lies shall not so effect it .
therefore will I ho@@ w@@ l for Mo@@ a@@ b , and I will cry out for all Mo@@ a@@ b ; mine heart shall mour@@ n for the men of K@@ ir @@@ -@@ @ her@@ es .
moreover I will cause to ce@@ ase in Mo@@ a@@ b , sa@@ ith the Lord , him that offer@@ eth in the high places , and him that bur@@ net@@ h incen@@ se to his go@@ ds .
therefore mine heart shall sound for Mo@@ a@@ b like pip@@ es , and mine heart shall sound like pip@@ es for the men of K@@ ir @@@ -@@ @ her@@ es : because the ri@@ ches that he hat@@ h gotten are per@@ ished .
for every head shall be bal@@ d , and every be@@ ard cli@@ pped : upon all the hands shall be cut@@ t@@ ings , and upon the lo@@ ins s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th .
there shall be lament@@ ation generally upon all the hous@@ et@@ ops of Mo@@ a@@ b , and in the streets there@@ of : for I have broken Mo@@ a@@ b like a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure , sa@@ ith the Lord .
Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men 's hear@@ ts in Mo@@ a@@ b at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
Wo@@ e be un@@ to the@@ e , O Mo@@ a@@ b ! the people of Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h per@@ is@@ het@@ h : for TH@@ Y sons are taken cap@@ tives , and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters cap@@ tives .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore gl@@ ori@@ est th@@ ou in the val@@ ley@@ s , TH@@ Y flow@@ ing val@@ ley , O back@@ sli@@ ding daughter ? that tr@@ usted in her treasures , saying , Wh@@ o shall come un@@ to me ?
and after@@ ward I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of the children of Am@@ mon , sa@@ ith the Lord .
flee ye , turn back , d@@ well deep , O inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the cal@@ am@@ ity of E@@ sa@@ u upon him , the time that I will visit him .
if gra@@ pe@@ gather@@ ers come to the@@ e , would they not leave some g@@ le@@ an@@ ing grap@@ es ? if th@@ i@@ ev@@ es by night , they will destroy ti@@ ll they have enough .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is sp@@ o@@ iled , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
I have heard a rum@@ our from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent un@@ to the he@@ a@@ then , saying , G@@ ather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
as in the overthrow of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h and the neighbour cities there@@ of , sa@@ ith the Lord , no man shall abide there , neither shall a son of man d@@ well in it .
the ear@@ th is moved at the no@@ ise of their fall , at the cry the no@@ ise there@@ of was heard in the Red sea .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread his w@@ ings over Boz@@ ra@@ h : and at that day shall the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
concerning Dam@@ as@@ cus . Ham@@ ath is con@@ founded , and Ar@@ p@@ ad : for they have heard ev@@ il ti@@ dings : they are fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ; there is sor@@ row on the sea ; it can@@ not be quiet .
Dam@@ as@@ cus is wa@@ xed fe@@ e@@ ble , and tur@@ net@@ h her@@ self to flee , and fear hat@@ h seized on her : an@@ gu@@ ish and sor@@ ro@@ ws have taken her , as a woman in trav@@ ail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and it shall consum@@ e the pal@@ aces of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad .
concerning K@@ ed@@ ar , and concerning the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of Haz@@ or , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall sm@@ ite , thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; arise ye , go up to K@@ ed@@ ar , and sp@@ oil the men of the east .
flee , get you far off , d@@ well deep , O ye inhabitants of Haz@@ or , sa@@ ith the Lord ; for Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h taken coun@@ sel against you , and hat@@ h conce@@ ived a purpose against you .
and Haz@@ or shall be a d@@ wel@@ ling for dra@@ g@@ ons , and a de@@ so@@ lation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man d@@ well in it .
the word of the Lord that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t against E@@ lam in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
and I will set my th@@ r@@ one in E@@ lam , and will destroy from th@@ ence the king and the pr@@ inces , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but it shall come to pass in the latter days , that I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of E@@ lam , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word that the Lord sp@@ ake against Bab@@ yl@@ on and against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t .
they shall ask the way to Z@@ ion with their faces th@@ i@@ ther@@ ward , saying , C@@ ome , and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpet@@ ual C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that shall not be forgotten .
remove out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and go forth out of the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and be as the he go@@ ats before the f@@ loc@@ ks .
because ye were glad , because ye re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , O ye destro@@ yers of mine heritage , because ye are grown f@@ at as the he@@ if@@ er at gr@@ ass , and Bel@@ low as bul@@ ls ;
your mother shall be sor@@ e con@@ founded ; she that b@@ are you shall be as@@ ha@@ med : be@@ hold , the hin@@ der@@ most of the nations shall be a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
because of the wr@@ ath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly de@@ so@@ late : every one that go@@ eth by Bab@@ yl@@ on shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and his@@ s at all her plagu@@ es .
put yo@@ ur@@ selves in array against Bab@@ yl@@ on round about : all ye that b@@ end the bo@@ w , sho@@ ot at her , spar@@ e no ar@@ ro@@ ws : for she hat@@ h sin@@ ned against the Lord .
Israel is a sc@@ at@@ tered she@@ ep ; the li@@ ons have driven him away : first the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a hat@@ h dev@@ oured him ; and last this Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h broken his b@@ ones .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will punish the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on and his land , as I have punished the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and I will bring Israel again to his habi@@ tation , and he shall fe@@ ed on Car@@ mel and B@@ ash@@ an , and his sou@@ l shall be satisfied upon mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pek@@ od : waste and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy after them , sa@@ ith the Lord , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e .
how is the ham@@ mer of the whole ear@@ th cut as@@ under and broken ! how is Bab@@ yl@@ on become a de@@ so@@ lation among the nations !
I have laid a sn@@ are for the@@ e , and th@@ ou art also taken , O Bab@@ yl@@ on , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not aware : th@@ ou art found , and also caught , because th@@ ou h@@ ast stri@@ ven against the Lord .
S@@ lay all her bul@@ loc@@ ks ; let them go down to the sla@@ ughter : wo@@ e un@@ to them ! for their day is come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the most proud shall st@@ um@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all round about him .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; The children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h were op@@ pressed together : and all that took them cap@@ tives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
their Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer is strong ; the Lord of hosts is his name : he shall throug@@ h@@ ly p@@ lead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and dis@@ quiet the inhabitants of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
a s@@ word is upon the Chal@@ de@@ ans , sa@@ ith the Lord , and upon the inhabitants of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and upon her pr@@ inces , and upon her wise men .
a s@@ word is upon the li@@ ars ; and they shall do@@ te : a s@@ word is upon her m@@ igh@@ ty men ; and they shall be dis@@ may@@ ed .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dri@@ ed up : for it is the land of Gra@@ ven images , and they are ma@@ d upon their id@@ ols .
as God over@@ threw So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h and the neighbour cities there@@ of , sa@@ ith the Lord ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man d@@ well there@@ in .
be@@ hold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h heard the report of them , and his hands wa@@ xed fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish took hold of him , and pan@@ gs as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
at the no@@ ise of the taking of Bab@@ yl@@ on the ear@@ th is moved , and the cry is heard among the nations .
and will send un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on f@@ ann@@ ers , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
against him that ben@@ de@@ th let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him that lif@@ te@@ th himself up in his bri@@ g@@ and@@ ine : and spar@@ e ye not her young men ; destroy ye ut@@ ter@@ ly all her host .
thus the sla@@ in shall fall in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they that are th@@ rust through in her streets .
for Israel hat@@ h not been for@@ sak@@ en , nor Ju@@ da@@ h of his God , of the Lord of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and deliver every man his sou@@ l : be not cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der un@@ to her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h been a golden c@@ up in the Lord 's hand , that made all the ear@@ th dr@@ un@@ ken : the nations have dr@@ un@@ ken of her wine ; therefore the nations are ma@@ d .
Bab@@ yl@@ on is su@@ d@@ den@@ ly fallen and destroyed : ho@@ w@@ l for her ; take bal@@ m for her p@@ ain , if so she may be he@@ aled .
the Lord hat@@ h brought forth our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : come , and let us declare in Z@@ ion the work of the Lord our God .
O th@@ ou that d@@ wel@@ lest upon many waters , ab@@ und@@ ant in treasures , th@@ ine end is come , and the measure of TH@@ Y c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness .
the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sworn by himself , saying , su@@ rely I will fill the@@ e with men , as with cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lers ; and they shall lift up a sh@@ out against the@@ e .
he hat@@ h made the ear@@ th by his power , he hat@@ h established the world by his wis@@ dom , and hat@@ h stret@@ ched out the heav@@ en by his understanding .
every man is bru@@ tish by his knowledge ; every founder is con@@ founded by the Gra@@ ven image : for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
they are van@@ ity , the work of err@@ ors : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall per@@ ish .
T@@ ho@@ u art my battle ax@@ e and weapons of war : for with the@@ e will I break in pieces the nations , and with the@@ e will I destroy k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ;
and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the char@@ i@@ ot and his Ri@@ der ;
with the@@ e also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces old and young ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the young man and the ma@@ id ;
and I will ren@@ der un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on and to all the inhabitants of Chal@@ de@@ a all their ev@@ il that they have done in Z@@ ion in your sight , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and they shall not take of the@@ e a stone for a cor@@ ner , nor a stone for foundations ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt be de@@ so@@ late for ever , sa@@ ith the Lord .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Me@@ des , the cap@@ tains there@@ of , and all the rul@@ ers there@@ of , and all the land of his domin@@ ion .
and the land shall tre@@ m@@ ble and sor@@ row : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation without an inhabi@@ tant .
the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Bab@@ yl@@ on have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hat@@ h failed ; they became as women : they have burned her d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will p@@ lead TH@@ Y cause , and take ven@@ ge@@ ance for the@@ e ; and I will d@@ ry up her sea , and make her spr@@ ings d@@ ry .
in their heat I will make their fe@@ asts , and I will make them dr@@ un@@ ken , that they may re@@ jo@@ ice , and sle@@ ep a perpet@@ ual sle@@ ep , and not wake , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the sea is come up upon Bab@@ yl@@ on : she is covered with the multi@@ tude of the waves there@@ of .
her cities are a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a land where@@ in no man d@@ wel@@ le@@ th , neither do@@ th any son of man pass there@@ by .
my people , go ye out of the mid@@ st of her , and deliver ye every man his sou@@ l from the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Gra@@ ven images of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and her whole land shall be con@@ founded , and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
then the heav@@ en and the ear@@ th , and all that is there@@ in , shall sing for Bab@@ yl@@ on : for the sp@@ o@@ ilers shall come un@@ to her from the north , sa@@ ith the Lord .
Y@@ e that have escaped the s@@ word , go away , stand not still : remember the Lord af@@ ar off , and let Jer@@ usalem come into your mind .
we are con@@ founded , because we have heard re@@ pro@@ ach : sh@@ ame hat@@ h covered our faces : for st@@ ran@@ gers are come into the sanc@@ tu@@ aries of the Lord 's house .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her Gra@@ ven images : and through all her land the wounded shall gro@@ an .
though Bab@@ yl@@ on should mount up to heav@@ en , and though she should for@@ ti@@ fy the he@@ ight of her strength , yet from me shall sp@@ o@@ ilers come un@@ to her , sa@@ ith the Lord .
a sound of a cry co@@ me@@ th from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and great destruction from the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans :
because the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled Bab@@ yl@@ on , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do ro@@ ar like great waters , a no@@ ise of their voice is ut@@ tered :
so Jerem@@ i@@ ah wrote in a book all the ev@@ il that should come upon Bab@@ yl@@ on , even all these words that are written against Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to Ser@@ ai@@ ah , When th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and s@@ halt see , and s@@ halt read all these words ;
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Th@@ us shall Bab@@ yl@@ on s@@ ink , and shall not rise from the ev@@ il that I will bring upon her : and they shall be we@@ ary . thus far are the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , ti@@ ll he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was sor@@ e in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up un@@ to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; where he gave judgment upon him .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he sle@@ w also all the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h in R@@ ib@@ lah .
and all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that were with the captain of the guard , br@@ ake down all the walls of Jer@@ usalem round about .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vin@@ ed@@ res@@ s@@ ers and for hus@@ b@@ and@@ men .
the cal@@ dr@@ ons also , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and all the vessels of br@@ ass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
and concerning the pil@@ lars , the he@@ ight of one pil@@ lar was E@@ igh@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a fil@@ let of twelve cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it ; and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness there@@ of was four fin@@ gers : it was hol@@ low .
and there were n@@ in@@ ety and six po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on a side ; and all the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates upon the network were an hundred round about .
and the captain of the guard took Ser@@ ai@@ ah the chief pri@@ est , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the second pri@@ est , and the three ke@@ epers of the door :
so Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and put them to death in R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . thus Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his own land .
this is the people whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar carried away cap@@ tive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty :
in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar he carried away cap@@ tive from Jer@@ usalem eight hundred thirty and two persons :
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and sp@@ ake kin@@ dly un@@ to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings that were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ,
and changed his prison gar@@ ments : and he did continu@@ ally eat bread before him all the days of his life .
and for his di@@ et , there was a contin@@ ual di@@ et given him of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
how do@@ th the city sit sol@@ itary , that was full of people how is she become as a wi@@ dow she that was was great among the nations , and pr@@ inc@@ ess among the provinces , how is she become tri@@ but@@ ary
she we@@ ep@@ eth sor@@ e in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks : among all her lov@@ ers she hat@@ h none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her , they are become her enem@@ ies .
Ju@@ da@@ h is gone into cap@@ tivity because of aff@@ li@@ ction , and because of great serv@@ itu@@ de : she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th among the he@@ a@@ then , she fin@@ de@@ th no rest : all her persec@@ ut@@ ors over@@ took her between the stra@@ its .
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts : all her gates are de@@ so@@ late : her pri@@ ests si@@ gh , her vir@@ g@@ ins are aff@@ lic@@ ted , and she is in bit@@ ter@@ ness .
and from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her beauty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , and they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
her fil@@ th@@ iness is in her sk@@ ir@@ ts ; she remember@@ eth not her last end ; therefore she came down won@@ der@@ fully : she had no comfor@@ ter . O Lord , be@@ hold my aff@@ li@@ ction : for the enemy hat@@ h mag@@ ni@@ fied himself .
the ad@@ versary hat@@ h spread out his hand upon all her pleas@@ ant things : for she hat@@ h seen that the he@@ a@@ then entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st command that they should not enter into TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation .
for these things I we@@ ep ; mine eye , mine eye run@@ net@@ h down with water , because the comfor@@ ter that should reli@@ eve my sou@@ l is far from me : my children are de@@ so@@ late , because the enemy prev@@ ailed .
the Lord is righ@@ te@@ ous ; for I have rebel@@ led against his comman@@ d@@ ment : hear , I pra@@ y you , all people , and be@@ hold my sor@@ row : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are gone into cap@@ tivity .
I called for my lov@@ ers , but they dec@@ e@@ ived me : my pri@@ ests and mine el@@ ders gave up the gh@@ ost in the city , while they sought their meat to reli@@ eve their so@@ ul@@ s .
let all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess come before the@@ e ; and do un@@ to them , as th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to me for all my trans@@ gres@@ sions : for my si@@ gh@@ s are many , and my heart is fa@@ int .
how hat@@ h the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger , and cast down from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , and remember@@ ed not his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger !
the Lord was as an enemy : he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up Israel , he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces : he hat@@ h destroyed his strong holds , and hat@@ h increased in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
mine eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my bo@@ wel@@ s are troubled , my li@@ ver is p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the su@@ ck@@ lings s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
they say to their mothers , W@@ here is cor@@ n and wine ? when they s@@ wo@@ oned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their sou@@ l was p@@ oured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets have seen v@@ ain and fo@@ ol@@ ish things for the@@ e : and they have not discovered th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , to turn away TH@@ Y cap@@ tivity ; but have seen for the@@ e false bur@@ den@@ s and causes of ban@@ is@@ hment .
their heart cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night : give th@@ y@@ self no rest ; let not the app@@ le of th@@ ine eye ce@@ ase .
be@@ hold , O Lord , and consider to whom th@@ ou h@@ ast done this . shall the women eat their fruit , and children of a sp@@ an long ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be sla@@ in in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in them in the day of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; th@@ ou h@@ ast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
I am the man that hat@@ h seen aff@@ li@@ ction by the ro@@ d of his wr@@ ath .
he hat@@ h led me , and brought me into d@@ ark@@ ness , but not into light .
su@@ rely against me is he turned ; he tur@@ net@@ h his hand against me all the day .
my f@@ les@@ h and my s@@ kin hat@@ h he made old ; he hat@@ h broken my b@@ ones .
he hat@@ h set me in dark places , as they that be dead of old .
he hat@@ h h@@ ed@@ ged me about , that I can@@ not get out : he hat@@ h made my chain heavy .
he hat@@ h inc@@ los@@ ed my ways with he@@ wn stone , he hat@@ h made my p@@ aths cro@@ oked .
he was un@@ to me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places .
he hat@@ h turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hat@@ h made me de@@ so@@ late .
he hat@@ h caused the ar@@ ro@@ ws of his qu@@ i@@ ver to enter into my re@@ ins .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast removed my sou@@ l far off from peace : I for@@ g@@ at prosperity .
my sou@@ l hat@@ h them still in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , and is hum@@ b@@ led in me .
this I rec@@ all to my mind , therefore have I hope .
the Lord is good un@@ to them that wait for him , to the sou@@ l that seek@@ eth him .
it is good that a man should both hope and qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly wait for the sal@@ vation of the Lord .
it is good for a man that he bear the yok@@ e in his youth .
he p@@ ut@@ te@@ th his m@@ outh in the d@@ ust ; if so be there may be hope .
he gi@@ vet@@ h his che@@ ek to him that sm@@ ite@@ th him : he is filled full with re@@ pro@@ ach .
but though he cause gri@@ ef , yet will he have comp@@ as@@ sion according to the multi@@ tude of his mer@@ cies .
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High ,
who is he that sa@@ ith , and it co@@ me@@ th to pass , when the Lord comman@@ de@@ th it not ?
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the Lord .
let us lift up our heart with our hands un@@ to God in the heav@@ ens .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast covered with an@@ ger , and persec@@ uted us : th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in , th@@ ou h@@ ast not p@@ iti@@ ed .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast covered th@@ y@@ self with a cl@@ oud , that our pray@@ er should not pass through .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made us as the off@@ s@@ cour@@ ing and refuse in the mid@@ st of the people .
mine eye run@@ net@@ h down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye tri@@ ck@@ le@@ th down , and ce@@ as@@ eth not , without any inter@@ mission ,
mine eye aff@@ ec@@ te@@ th mine heart because of all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of my city .
they have cut off my life in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on , and cast a stone upon me .
I called upon TH@@ Y name , O Lord , out of the low d@@ un@@ ge@@ on .
O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast pleaded the causes of my sou@@ l ; th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed my life .
be@@ hold their sitting down , and their rising up ; I am their musi@@ ck .
ren@@ der un@@ to them a re@@ comp@@ ence , O Lord , according to the work of their hands .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most fine gold changed ! the stones of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary are p@@ oured out in the top of every street .
the pre@@ ci@@ ous sons of Z@@ ion , compar@@ able to fine gold , how are they es@@ te@@ emed as ear@@ then pit@@ chers , the work of the hands of the P@@ ot@@ ter !
the ton@@ gue of the suc@@ king child cle@@ av@@ eth to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man break@@ eth it un@@ to them .
her N@@ azar@@ ites were pu@@ rer than snow , they were w@@ hi@@ ter than milk , they were more ru@@ d@@ dy in body than ru@@ bies , their polis@@ hing was of sap@@ ph@@ ire :
their vis@@ age is bla@@ cker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their s@@ kin cle@@ av@@ eth to their b@@ ones ; it is with@@ ered , it is become like a stick .
they that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word are better than they that be sla@@ in with hunger : for these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have so@@ dden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the Lord hat@@ h accomplished his fur@@ y ; he hat@@ h p@@ oured out his fierce an@@ ger , and hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led a fire in Z@@ ion , and it hat@@ h dev@@ oured the foundations there@@ of .
the kings of the ear@@ th , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the ad@@ versary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
for the sin@@ s of her pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of her pri@@ ests , that have shed the blood of the just in the mid@@ st of her ,
they have w@@ and@@ ered as b@@ lin@@ d men in the streets , they have pollu@@ ted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their gar@@ ments .
the an@@ ger of the Lord hat@@ h divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the pri@@ ests , they favoured not the el@@ ders .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our v@@ ain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
they hunt our steps , that we can@@ not go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
our persec@@ ut@@ ors are swi@@ f@@ ter than the e@@ ag@@ les of the heav@@ en : they pursu@@ ed us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the bre@@ ath of our nos@@ tr@@ ils , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the Lord , was taken in their p@@ its , of whom we said , Under his shadow we shall live among the he@@ a@@ then .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , O daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ wel@@ lest in the land of U@@ z ; the c@@ up also shall pass through un@@ to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt be dr@@ un@@ ken , and s@@ halt make th@@ y@@ self nak@@ ed .
the punishment of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is accomplished , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; he will no more carry the@@ e away into cap@@ tivity : he will visit th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , O daughter of E@@ dom ; he will discover TH@@ Y sin@@ s .
we have given the hand to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , to be satisfied with bread .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that do@@ th deliver us out of their hand .
we g@@ at our bread with the per@@ il of our lives because of the s@@ word of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
they ra@@ vis@@ hed the women in Z@@ ion , and the ma@@ ids in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
pr@@ inces are han@@ ged up by their hand : the faces of el@@ ders were not honoured .
the joy of our heart is ce@@ ased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
because of the mountain of Z@@ ion , which is de@@ so@@ late , the fo@@ x@@ es walk upon it .
turn th@@ ou us un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , and we shall be turned ; ren@@ ew our days as of old .
in the fifth day of the month , which was the fifth year of king Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in 's cap@@ tivity ,
also out of the mid@@ st there@@ of came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . and this was their appearance ; they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
and their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot : and they spar@@ k@@ led like the col@@ our of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
and they had the hands of a man under their w@@ ings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their w@@ ings .
their w@@ ings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
and they went every one stra@@ ight forward : w@@ hi@@ ther the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
and the living cre@@ atures ran and returned as the appearance of a f@@ lash of ligh@@ t@@ ning .
now as I be@@ held the living cre@@ atures , be@@ hold one whe@@ el upon the ear@@ th by the living cre@@ atures , with his four faces .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like un@@ to the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l : and they four had one lik@@ eness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el in the middle of a whe@@ el .
when they went , they went upon their four sides : and they turned not when they went .
as for their r@@ ings , they were so high that they were d@@ read@@ ful ; and their r@@ ings were full of eyes round about them four .
and when the living cre@@ atures went , the whe@@ els went by them : and when the living cre@@ atures were lifted up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els were lifted up .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went , th@@ ither was their spirit to go ; and the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
and the lik@@ eness of the fir@@ mam@@ ent upon the heads of the living cre@@ ature was as the col@@ our of the ter@@ ri@@ ble cr@@ y@@ st@@ al , stret@@ ched forth over their heads above .
and there was a voice from the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was over their heads , when they stood , and had let down their w@@ ings .
and the spirit entered into me when he sp@@ ake un@@ to me , and set me upon my feet , that I heard him that sp@@ ake un@@ to me .
for they are imp@@ u@@ dent children and sti@@ ff@@ hear@@ ted . I do send the@@ e un@@ to them ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , ) yet shall know that there hat@@ h been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak my words un@@ to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear : for they are most rebel@@ li@@ ous .
but th@@ ou , son of man , hear what I say un@@ to the@@ e ; Be not th@@ ou rebel@@ li@@ ous like that rebel@@ li@@ ous house : open TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and eat that I give the@@ e .
and when I looked , be@@ hold , an hand was sent un@@ to me ; and , lo , a rol@@ l of a book was there@@ in ;
and he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written there@@ in lament@@ ations , and mourning , and wo@@ e .
and he said un@@ to me , Son of man , go , get the@@ e un@@ to the house of Israel , and speak with my words un@@ to them .
for th@@ ou art not sent to a people of a st@@ range speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
not to many people of a st@@ range speech and of an hard language , whose words th@@ ou can@@ st not understand . su@@ rely , had I sent the@@ e to them , they would have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e .
but the house of Israel will not he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e ; for they will not he@@ arken un@@ to me : for all the house of Israel are imp@@ u@@ dent and hard@@ hear@@ ted .
be@@ hold , I have made TH@@ Y face strong against their faces , and TH@@ Y fore@@ head strong against their fore@@ heads .
as an adam@@ ant harder than F@@ lin@@ t have I made TH@@ Y fore@@ head : fear them not , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed at their looks , though they be a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
moreover he said un@@ to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak un@@ to the@@ e receive in th@@ ine heart , and hear with th@@ ine e@@ ars .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rus@@ hing , saying , b@@ les@@ sed be the gl@@ ory of the Lord from his place .
I heard also the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures that touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els over against them , and a no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the cap@@ tivity at Tel @@@ -@@ @ abi@@ b , that d@@ wel@@ t by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there ast@@ on@@ ished among them seven days .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made the@@ e a watch@@ man un@@ to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my m@@ outh , and give them warning from me .
yet if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he turn not from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
nevertheless if th@@ ou warn the righ@@ te@@ ous man , that the righ@@ te@@ ous sin not , and he do@@ th not sin , he shall su@@ rely live , because he is warned ; also th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
and the hand of the Lord was there upon me ; and he said un@@ to me , arise , go forth into the pla@@ in , and I will there talk with the@@ e .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
but th@@ ou , O son of man , be@@ hold , they shall put bands upon the@@ e , and shall bin@@ d the@@ e with them , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go out among them :
and I will make TH@@ Y ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , that th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and s@@ halt not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
T@@ ho@@ u also , son of man , take the@@ e a tile , and lay it before the@@ e , and po@@ ur@@ tra@@ y upon it the city , even Jer@@ usalem :
and lay siege against it , and build a For@@ t against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it round about .
for I have laid upon the@@ e the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days : so s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt set TH@@ Y face toward the siege of Jer@@ usalem , and th@@ ine arm shall be uncovered , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against it .
and , be@@ hold , I will lay bands upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not turn the@@ e from one side to another , ti@@ ll th@@ ou h@@ ast ended the days of TH@@ Y siege .
and TH@@ Y meat which th@@ ou s@@ halt eat shall be by weight , twenty sh@@ ek@@ els a day : from time to time s@@ halt th@@ ou eat it .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an hin : from time to time s@@ halt th@@ ou drink .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat it as bar@@ ley cak@@ es , and th@@ ou s@@ halt bak@@ e it with D@@ ung that co@@ me@@ th out of man , in their sight .
and the Lord said , E@@ ven thus shall the children of Israel eat their def@@ iled bread among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , w@@ hi@@ ther I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be ast@@ on@@ ied one with another , and consum@@ e away for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also take there@@ of a few in number , and bin@@ d them in TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; This is Jer@@ usalem : I have set it in the mid@@ st of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hat@@ h changed my judg@@ ments into w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judg@@ ments and my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I , even I , am against the@@ e , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the mid@@ st of the@@ e in the sight of the nations .
and I will do in the@@ e that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the@@ e , and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of the@@ e will I sc@@ at@@ ter into all the winds .
moreover I will make the@@ e waste , and a re@@ pro@@ ach among the nations that are round about the@@ e , in the sight of all that pass by .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and your al@@ tar@@ s shall be de@@ so@@ late , and your images shall be broken : and I will cast down your sla@@ in men before your id@@ ols .
and I will lay the dead car@@ cases of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones round about your al@@ tar@@ s .
yet will I leave a re@@ mn@@ ant , that ye may have some that shall escape the s@@ word among the nations , when ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I have not said in v@@ ain that I would do this ev@@ il un@@ to them .
he that is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he that is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he that remain@@ eth and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my fur@@ y upon them .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
also , th@@ ou son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to the land of Israel ; A@@ n end , the end is come upon the four cor@@ ners of the land .
now is the end come upon the@@ e , and I will send mine an@@ ger upon the@@ e , and will judge the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways , and will re@@ compen@@ se upon the@@ e all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
the morning is come un@@ to the@@ e , O th@@ ou that d@@ wel@@ lest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the so@@ unding again of the mountains .
now will I shortly p@@ our out my fur@@ y upon the@@ e , and accomp@@ lish mine an@@ ger upon the@@ e : and I will judge the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways , and will re@@ compen@@ se the@@ e for all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
be@@ hold the day , be@@ hold , it is come : the morning is gone forth ; the ro@@ d hat@@ h b@@ los@@ so@@ med , pride hat@@ h bud@@ ded .
violence is risen up into a ro@@ d of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : none of them shall remain , nor of their multi@@ tude , nor of any of the@@ ir@@ s : neither shall there be w@@ ailing for them .
the time is come , the day dra@@ w@@ eth near : let not the buyer re@@ jo@@ ice , nor the seller mour@@ n : for wr@@ ath is upon all the multi@@ tude there@@ of .
they have blo@@ wn the tr@@ ump@@ et , even to make all ready ; but none go@@ eth to the battle : for my wr@@ ath is upon all the multi@@ tude there@@ of .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mourning , every one for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
all hands shall be fe@@ e@@ ble , and all k@@ ne@@ es shall be weak as water .
they shall also gir@@ d themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and hor@@ ror shall cover them ; and sh@@ ame shall be upon all faces , and bal@@ d@@ ness upon all their heads .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty : but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and of their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall poll@@ ute it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall poll@@ ute my secret place : for the rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and def@@ ile it .
make a chain : for the land is full of blo@@ ody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I will bring the worst of the he@@ a@@ then , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pom@@ p of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be def@@ iled .
destruction co@@ me@@ th ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
Mis@@ chief shall come upon mis@@ chief , and rum@@ our shall be upon rum@@ our ; then shall they seek a vision of the pro@@ phe@@ t ; but the law shall per@@ ish from the pri@@ est , and coun@@ sel from the an@@ ci@@ ents .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber .
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the pla@@ in .
and he brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , be@@ hold a hol@@ e in the wall .
then said he un@@ to me , Son of man , di@@ g now in the wall : and when I had dig@@ ged in the wall , be@@ hold a door .
so I went in and saw ; and be@@ hold every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ omin@@ able be@@ asts , and all the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , po@@ ur@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed upon the wall round about .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord 's house which was toward the north ; and , be@@ hold , there sat women we@@ eping for Tam@@ muz .
then said he un@@ to me , H@@ ast th@@ ou seen this , O son of man ? turn the@@ e yet again , and th@@ ou s@@ halt see greater ab@@ omin@@ ations than these .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , G@@ o ye after him through the city , and sm@@ ite : let not your eye spar@@ e , neither have ye p@@ ity :
and he said un@@ to them , Def@@ ile the house , and fill the courts with the sla@@ in : go ye forth . and they went forth , and sle@@ w in the city .
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity , but I will re@@ compen@@ se their way upon their head .
and , be@@ hold , the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , which had the in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as th@@ ou h@@ ast comman@@ ded me .
then I looked , and , be@@ hold , in the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was above the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there appeared over them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
now the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cl@@ oud filled the in@@ ner court .
and the sound of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms ' w@@ ings was heard even to the ou@@ ter court , as the voice of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty God when he speak@@ eth .
and there appeared in the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms the form of a man 's hand under their w@@ ings .
and when I looked , be@@ hold the four whe@@ els by the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , one whe@@ el by one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el by another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : and the appearance of the whe@@ els was as the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
and as for their appe@@ aran@@ ces , they four had one lik@@ eness , as if a whe@@ el had been in the mid@@ st of a whe@@ el .
when they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place w@@ hi@@ ther the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes round about , even the whe@@ els that they four had .
as for the whe@@ els , it was cri@@ ed un@@ to them in my hearing , O whe@@ el .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms were lifted up . this is the living cre@@ ature that I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar .
and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms went , the whe@@ els went by them : and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lifted up their w@@ ings to mount up from the ear@@ th , the same whe@@ els also turned not from bes@@ ide them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in them .
then the gl@@ ory of the Lord depar@@ ted from off the threshold of the house , and stood over the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
this is the living cre@@ ature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of C@@ he@@ bar ; and I knew that they were the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
every one had four faces ap@@ i@@ ece , and every one four w@@ ings ; and the lik@@ eness of the hands of a man was under their w@@ ings .
and the lik@@ eness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves : they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
Y@@ e have multi@@ p@@ lied your sla@@ in in this city , and ye have filled the streets there@@ of with the sla@@ in .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ our sla@@ in whom ye have laid in the mid@@ st of it , they are the f@@ les@@ h , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the mid@@ st of it .
Y@@ e have fear@@ ed the s@@ word ; and I will bring a s@@ word upon you , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and I will bring you out of the mid@@ st there@@ of , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
Y@@ e shall fall by the s@@ word ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
this city shall not be your cal@@ dr@@ on , neither shall ye be the f@@ les@@ h in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
and they shall come th@@ ither , and they shall take away all the de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ of and all the ab@@ omin@@ ations there@@ of from th@@ ence .
that they may walk in my stat@@ utes , and keep mine ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walk@@ eth after the heart of their de@@ te@@ stable things and their ab@@ omin@@ ations , I will re@@ compen@@ se their way upon their own heads , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
then did the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lift up their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
the word of the Lord also came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , th@@ ou d@@ wel@@ lest in the mid@@ st of a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have e@@ ars to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth TH@@ Y stu@@ ff by day in their sight , as stu@@ ff for removing : and th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into cap@@ tivity .
di@@ g th@@ ou through the wall in their sight , and carry out there@@ by .
say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done un@@ to them : they shall remove and go into cap@@ tivity .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the s@@ word after them .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall sc@@ at@@ ter them among the nations , and disper@@ se them in the countries .
moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
son of man , eat TH@@ Y bread with qu@@ ak@@ ing , and drink TH@@ Y water with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling and with car@@ eful@@ ness ;
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be de@@ so@@ late ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , what is that pro@@ ver@@ b that ye have in the land of Israel , saying , The days are prol@@ on@@ ged , and every vision fail@@ eth ?
for there shall be no more any v@@ ain vision nor f@@ lat@@ tering div@@ ination within the house of Israel .
son of man , be@@ hold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he se@@ eth is for many days to come , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth of the times that are far off .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Israel that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , and say th@@ ou un@@ to them that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y out of their own hear@@ ts , He@@ ar ye the word of the Lord ;
Y@@ e have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither made up the h@@ edge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
they have seen van@@ ity and lying div@@ ination , saying , The Lord sa@@ ith : and the Lord hat@@ h not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a v@@ ain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying div@@ ination , whereas ye say , The Lord sa@@ ith it ; al@@ be@@ it I have not spoken ?
say un@@ to them which da@@ u@@ b it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
L@@ o , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said un@@ to you , W@@ here is the da@@ ub@@ ing where@@ with ye have da@@ ub@@ ed it ?
likewise , th@@ ou son of man , set TH@@ Y face against the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of TH@@ Y people , which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y out of their own heart ; and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y th@@ ou against them ,
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , by promising him life :
therefore ye shall see no more van@@ ity , nor div@@ ine div@@ inations : for I will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
then came certain of the el@@ ders of Israel un@@ to me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have set up their id@@ ols in their heart , and put the stumb@@ l@@ ing@@ block of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity before their face : should I be inqu@@ ired of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all es@@ tran@@ ged from me through their id@@ ols .
therefore say un@@ to the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; rep@@ ent , and turn yo@@ ur@@ selves from your id@@ ols ; and turn away your faces from all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and if the pro@@ phe@@ t be dec@@ e@@ ived when he hat@@ h spoken a thing , I the Lord have dec@@ e@@ ived that pro@@ phe@@ t , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the mid@@ st of my people Israel .
and they shall bear the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : the punishment of the pro@@ phe@@ t shall be even as the punishment of him that seek@@ eth un@@ to him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more as@@ tra@@ y from me , neither be pollu@@ ted any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
the word of the Lord came again to me , saying ,
if I cause no@@ is@@ ome be@@ asts to pass through the land , and they sp@@ oil it , so that it be de@@ so@@ late , that no man may pass through because of the be@@ asts :
or if I bring a s@@ word upon that land , and say , s@@ word , go through the land ; so that I cut off man and be@@ ast from it :
though these three men were in it , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
or if I send a p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce into that land , and p@@ our out my fur@@ y upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and be@@ ast :
though No@@ ah , Daniel , and Jo@@ b , were in it , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own so@@ ul@@ s by their righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and they shall comfor@@ t you , when ye see their ways and their do@@ ings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , What is the v@@ ine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th both the ends of it , and the mid@@ st of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to Jer@@ usalem ; Th@@ y birth and TH@@ Y nati@@ vity is of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; TH@@ Y father was an Am@@ or@@ ite , and TH@@ Y mother an H@@ itti@@ te .
and as for TH@@ Y nati@@ vity , in the day th@@ ou w@@ ast born TH@@ Y nav@@ el was not cut , neither w@@ ast th@@ ou was@@ hed in water to supp@@ le the@@ e ; th@@ ou w@@ ast not sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed the@@ e , to do any of these un@@ to the@@ e , to have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e ; but th@@ ou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of TH@@ Y person , in the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast born .
and when I passed by the@@ e , and saw the@@ e pollu@@ ted in th@@ ine own blood , I said un@@ to the@@ e when th@@ ou w@@ ast in TH@@ Y blood , Li@@ ve ; ye@@ a , I said un@@ to the@@ e when th@@ ou w@@ ast in TH@@ Y blood , Li@@ ve .
then was@@ hed I the@@ e with water ; ye@@ a , I throug@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed away TH@@ Y blood from the@@ e , and I ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e with oil .
I clo@@ th@@ ed the@@ e also with bro@@ i@@ dered work , and sho@@ d the@@ e with bad@@ gers ' s@@ kin , and I gir@@ ded the@@ e about with fine lin@@ en , and I covered the@@ e with sil@@ k .
I dec@@ ked the@@ e also with or@@ nam@@ ents , and I put brac@@ ele@@ ts upon TH@@ Y hands , and a chain on TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
and I put a je@@ w@@ el on TH@@ Y fore@@ head , and ear@@ r@@ ings in th@@ ine e@@ ars , and a beautiful cro@@ wn upon th@@ ine head .
and TH@@ Y ren@@ own went forth among the he@@ a@@ then for TH@@ Y beauty : for it was perfect through my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess , which I had put upon the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
but th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st trust in th@@ ine own beauty , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot because of TH@@ Y ren@@ own , and p@@ ou@@ red@@ st out TH@@ Y for@@ nic@@ ations on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of TH@@ Y gar@@ ments th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y high places with di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also taken TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given the@@ e , and ma@@ dest to th@@ y@@ self images of men , and di@@ d@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
and to@@ ok@@ est TH@@ Y bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments , and cover@@ ed@@ st them : and th@@ ou h@@ ast set mine oil and mine incen@@ se before them .
moreover th@@ ou h@@ ast taken TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast bor@@ ne un@@ to me , and these h@@ ast th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to them to be dev@@ oured . is this of TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms a small matter ,
that th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and in all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations and TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms th@@ ou h@@ ast not remember@@ ed the days of TH@@ Y youth , when th@@ ou w@@ ast nak@@ ed and b@@ are , and w@@ ast pollu@@ ted in TH@@ Y blood .
and it came to pass after all TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , ( wo@@ e , wo@@ e un@@ to the@@ e ! sa@@ ith the Lord God ; )
that th@@ ou h@@ ast also built un@@ to the@@ e an emin@@ ent place , and h@@ ast made the@@ e an high place in every street .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast built TH@@ Y high place at every head of the way , and h@@ ast made TH@@ Y beauty to be ab@@ hor@@ red , and h@@ ast opened TH@@ Y feet to every one that passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also committed for@@ nic@@ ation with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans TH@@ Y neighbours , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and h@@ ast increased TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast played the wh@@ ore also with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , because th@@ ou w@@ ast un@@ s@@ ati@@ able ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou h@@ ast played the har@@ lot with them , and yet co@@ ul@@ dest not be satisfied .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast moreover multi@@ p@@ lied TH@@ Y for@@ nic@@ ation in the land of Can@@ a@@ an un@@ to Chal@@ de@@ a ; and yet th@@ ou w@@ ast not satisfied her@@ e@@ with .
in that th@@ ou buil@@ dest th@@ ine emin@@ ent place in the head of every way , and mak@@ est th@@ ine high place in every street ; and h@@ ast not been as an har@@ lot , in that th@@ ou scor@@ n@@ est h@@ ire ;
they give gifts to all who@@ res : but th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est TH@@ Y gifts to all TH@@ Y lov@@ ers , and hi@@ rest them , that they may come un@@ to the@@ e on every side for TH@@ Y wh@@ ore@@ dom .
and the contrary is in the@@ e from other women in TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms , whereas none follow@@ eth the@@ e to commit who@@ red@@ oms : and in that th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est a reward , and no reward is given un@@ to the@@ e , therefore th@@ ou art contrary .
and I will judge the@@ e , as women that break w@@ ed@@ lock and shed blood are jud@@ ged ; and I will give the@@ e blood in fur@@ y and je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
they shall also bring up a company against the@@ e , and they shall stone the@@ e with stones , and th@@ rust the@@ e through with their s@@ words .
so will I make my fur@@ y toward the@@ e to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
be@@ hold , every one that us@@ eth Pro@@ ver@@ bs shall use this pro@@ ver@@ b against the@@ e , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
T@@ ho@@ u art TH@@ Y mother 's daughter , that lo@@ th@@ eth her husband and her children ; and th@@ ou art the sister of TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , which lo@@ th@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was an H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
yet h@@ ast th@@ ou not walked after their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations : but , as if that were a very little thing , th@@ ou w@@ ast cor@@ rupted more than they in all TH@@ Y ways .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of TH@@ Y sister So@@ dom , pride , ful@@ ness of bread , and ab@@ und@@ ance of id@@ len@@ ess was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither hat@@ h Samar@@ ia committed half of TH@@ Y sin@@ s ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast multi@@ p@@ lied th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations more than they , and h@@ ast justified TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers in all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations which th@@ ou h@@ ast done .
that th@@ ou may@@ est bear th@@ ine own sh@@ ame , and may@@ est be con@@ founded in all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , in that th@@ ou art a comfor@@ t un@@ to them .
when TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate , and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate , then th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
nevertheless I will remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the@@ e in the days of TH@@ Y youth , and I will establish un@@ to the@@ e an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord :
that th@@ ou may@@ est remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open TH@@ Y m@@ outh any more because of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , when I am p@@ ac@@ ified toward the@@ e for all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; A great e@@ ag@@ le with great w@@ ings , long@@ w@@ ing@@ ed , full of fe@@ ath@@ ers , which had di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs , came un@@ to Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the c@@ ed@@ ar :
he cro@@ pped off the top of his young tw@@ ig@@ s , and carried it into a land of traffic@@ k ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
he took also of the se@@ ed of the land , and plan@@ ted it in a fruit@@ ful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a w@@ il@@ low tree .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
Ye@@ a , be@@ hold , being plan@@ ted , shall it prosp@@ er ? shall it not ut@@ ter@@ ly wi@@ ther , when the east wind tou@@ ch@@ eth it ? it shall wi@@ ther in the fur@@ ro@@ ws where it grew .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and hat@@ h taken of the king 's se@@ ed , and made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him , and hat@@ h taken an oath of him : he hat@@ h also taken the m@@ igh@@ ty of the land :
that the k@@ ing@@ dom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant it might stand .
seeing he desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hat@@ h done all these things , he shall not escape .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will p@@ lead with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed against me .
the word of the Lord came un@@ to me again , saying ,
what mean ye , that ye use this pro@@ ver@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge ?
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this pro@@ ver@@ b in Israel .
be@@ hold , all so@@ ul@@ s are mine ; as the sou@@ l of the father , so also the sou@@ l of the son is mine : the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h , it shall die .
he that hat@@ h not given forth upon us@@ ury , neither hat@@ h taken any increase , that hat@@ h withdrawn his hand from in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , hat@@ h executed true judgment between man and man ,
H@@ ath walked in my stat@@ utes , and hat@@ h kept my judg@@ ments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall su@@ rely live , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
if he be@@ get a son that is a rob@@ ber , a sh@@ ed@@ der of blood , and that do@@ eth the like to any one of these things ,
and that do@@ eth not any of those duties , but even hat@@ h e@@ aten upon the mountains , and def@@ iled his neighbour 's wife ,
H@@ ath op@@ pressed the poor and ne@@ edy , hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , hat@@ h not restored the pledge , and hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols , hat@@ h committed ab@@ omin@@ ation ,
H@@ ath given forth upon us@@ ury , and hat@@ h taken increase : shall he then live ? he shall not live : he hat@@ h done all these ab@@ omin@@ ations ; he shall su@@ rely die ; his blood shall be upon him .
now , lo , if he be@@ get a son , that se@@ eth all his father 's sin@@ s which he hat@@ h done , and consider@@ eth , and do@@ eth not such like ,
that hat@@ h not e@@ aten upon the mountains , neither hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , hat@@ h not def@@ iled his neighbour 's wife ,
neither hat@@ h op@@ pressed any , hat@@ h not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , but hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ,
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , sp@@ o@@ iled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked will turn from all his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hat@@ h committed , they shall not be mentioned un@@ to him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he hat@@ h done he shall live .
have I any pleas@@ ure at all that the w@@ ic@@ ked should die ? sa@@ ith the Lord God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
when a righ@@ te@@ ous man tur@@ net@@ h away from his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and commit@@ te@@ th in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and di@@ eth in them ; for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity that he hat@@ h done shall he die .
because he consider@@ eth , and tur@@ net@@ h away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hat@@ h committed , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , where@@ by ye have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
for I have no pleas@@ ure in the death of him that di@@ eth , sa@@ ith the Lord God : where@@ fore turn yo@@ ur@@ selves , and live ye .
and she brought up one of her whel@@ ps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the pre@@ y ; it dev@@ oured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their p@@ it , and they brought him with cha@@ ins un@@ to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had w@@ aited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whel@@ ps , and made him a young lion .
and he knew their de@@ so@@ late pal@@ aces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was de@@ so@@ late , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of , by the no@@ ise of his ro@@ aring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their p@@ it .
and they put him in ward in cha@@ ins , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
TH@@ Y mother is like a v@@ ine in TH@@ Y blood , plan@@ ted by the waters : she was fruit@@ ful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and she had strong ro@@ ds for the scep@@ t@@ res of them that b@@ are rule , and her stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted among the th@@ ick branches , and she appeared in her he@@ ight with the multi@@ tude of her branches .
but she was p@@ lu@@ cked up in fur@@ y , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dri@@ ed up her fruit : her strong ro@@ ds were broken and with@@ ered ; the fire consu@@ med them .
and now she is plan@@ ted in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a d@@ ry and thir@@ st@@ y ground .
then said I un@@ to them , cast ye away every man the ab@@ omin@@ ations of his eyes , and def@@ ile not yo@@ ur@@ selves with the id@@ ols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and I gave them my stat@@ utes , and she@@ wed them my judg@@ ments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
moreover also I gave them my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them out .
because they desp@@ ised my judg@@ ments , and walked not in my stat@@ utes , but pollu@@ ted my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths : for their heart went after their id@@ ols .
nevertheless mine eye spar@@ ed them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but I said un@@ to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Wal@@ k ye not in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their judg@@ ments , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols :
I am the Lord your God ; walk in my stat@@ utes , and keep my judg@@ ments , and do them ;
and hal@@ low my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that I am the Lord your God .
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them also in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would sc@@ at@@ ter them among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my judg@@ ments , but had desp@@ ised my stat@@ utes , and had pollu@@ ted my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and their eyes were after their fa@@ thers ' id@@ ols .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I gave them also stat@@ utes that were not good , and judg@@ ments where@@ by they should not live ;
therefore , son of man , speak un@@ to the house of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ et in this your fa@@ thers have b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
then I said un@@ to them , What is the high place where@@ un@@ to ye go ? and the name there@@ of is called B@@ am@@ ah un@@ to this day .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out , will I rule over you :
and I will bring you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the people , and there will I p@@ lead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fa@@ thers in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the land of Egypt , so will I p@@ lead with you , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been def@@ iled ; and ye shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that ye have committed .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , set TH@@ Y face toward the south , and drop TH@@ Y word toward the south , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the forest of the south field ;
then said I , A@@ h Lord God ! they say of me , Do@@ th he not speak par@@ ables ?
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , set TH@@ Y face toward Jer@@ usalem , and drop TH@@ Y word toward the hol@@ y places , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the land of Israel ,
seeing then that I will cut off from the@@ e the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked , therefore shall my s@@ word go forth out of his she@@ ath against all f@@ les@@ h from the south to the north :
that all f@@ les@@ h may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my s@@ word out of his she@@ ath : it shall not return any more .
it is shar@@ pen@@ ed to make a sor@@ e sla@@ ughter ; it is fur@@ b@@ ished that it may g@@ lit@@ ter : should we then make mir@@ th ? it con@@ tem@@ net@@ h the ro@@ d of my son , as every tree .
and he hat@@ h give it to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : this s@@ word is shar@@ pen@@ ed , and it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the S@@ lay@@ er .
because it is a trial , and what if the s@@ word con@@ tem@@ n even the ro@@ d ? it shall be no more , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
go the@@ e one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y face is set .
I will also sm@@ ite mine hands together , and I will cause my fur@@ y to rest : I the Lord have said it .
the word of the Lord came un@@ to me again , saying ,
appoint a way , that the s@@ word may come to R@@ ab@@ b@@ ath of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to Ju@@ da@@ h in Jer@@ usalem the def@@ enced .
and it shall be un@@ to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , to them that have sworn o@@ aths : but he will call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that they may be taken .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Rem@@ o@@ ve the di@@ ade@@ m , and take off the cro@@ wn : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
I will over@@ turn , over@@ turn , over@@ turn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him .
shall I cause it to return into his she@@ ath ? I will judge the@@ e in the place where th@@ ou w@@ ast created , in the land of TH@@ Y nati@@ vity .
and I will p@@ our out mine in@@ dign@@ ation upon the@@ e , I will blow against the@@ e in the fire of my wr@@ ath , and deliver the@@ e into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and s@@ kil@@ ful to destroy .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be for fuel to the fire ; TH@@ Y blood shall be in the mid@@ st of the land ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be no more remember@@ ed : for I the Lord have spoken it .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
now , th@@ ou son of man , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou judge , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou judge the blo@@ ody city ? ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w her all her ab@@ omin@@ ations .
then say th@@ ou , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God , The city sh@@ ed@@ de@@ th blood in the mid@@ st of it , that her time may come , and mak@@ eth id@@ ols against her@@ self to def@@ ile her@@ self .
those that be near , and those that be far from the@@ e , shall mo@@ ck the@@ e , which art inf@@ am@@ ous and much v@@ ex@@ ed .
be@@ hold , the pr@@ inces of Israel , every one were in the@@ e to their power to shed blood .
in the@@ e have they set light by father and mother : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e have they dealt by op@@ pression with the st@@ ran@@ ger : in the@@ e have they v@@ ex@@ ed the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
in the@@ e are men that carry tal@@ es to shed blood : and in the@@ e they eat upon the mountains : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e they commit le@@ w@@ d@@ ness .
in the@@ e have they discovered their fa@@ thers ' nak@@ edn@@ ess : in the@@ e have they hum@@ b@@ led her that was set apart for pollution .
in the@@ e have they taken gifts to shed blood ; th@@ ou h@@ ast taken us@@ ury and increase , and th@@ ou h@@ ast gre@@ edil@@ y gained of TH@@ Y neighbours by ex@@ tor@@ tion , and h@@ ast forgotten me , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
be@@ hold , therefore I have s@@ mit@@ ten mine hand at TH@@ Y dis@@ honest gain which th@@ ou h@@ ast made , and at TH@@ Y blood which hat@@ h been in the mid@@ st of the@@ e .
can th@@ ine heart en@@ dur@@ e , or can th@@ ine hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with the@@ e ? I the Lord have spoken it , and will do it .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the@@ e among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se the@@ e in the countries , and will consum@@ e TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness out of the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance in th@@ y@@ self in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dro@@ ss : all they are br@@ ass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are even the dro@@ ss of silver .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause ye are all become dro@@ ss , be@@ hold , therefore I will gather you into the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem .
Ye@@ a , I will gather you , and blow upon you in the fire of my wr@@ ath , and ye shall be mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
as silver is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace , so shall ye be mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; and ye shall know that I the Lord have p@@ oured out my fur@@ y upon you .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
her pr@@ inces in the mid@@ st there@@ of are like w@@ ol@@ ves ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y , to shed blood , and to destroy so@@ ul@@ s , to get dis@@ honest gain .
and her pro@@ ph@@ ets have da@@ ub@@ ed them with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , seeing van@@ ity , and div@@ ining lies un@@ to them , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God , when the Lord hat@@ h not spoken .
therefore have I p@@ oured out mine in@@ dign@@ ation upon them ; I have consu@@ med them with the fire of my wr@@ ath : their own way have I re@@ compen@@ sed upon their heads , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
and they committed who@@ red@@ oms in Egypt ; they committed who@@ red@@ oms in their youth : there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there they bru@@ ised the te@@ ats of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and A@@ ho@@ lah played the har@@ lot when she was mine ; and she do@@ ted on her lov@@ ers , on the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans her neighbours ,
thus she committed her who@@ red@@ oms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and with all on whom she do@@ ted : with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither left she her who@@ red@@ oms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bru@@ ised the bre@@ asts of her vir@@ gin@@ ity , and p@@ oured their wh@@ ore@@ dom upon her .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I have delivered her into the hand of her lov@@ ers , into the hand of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , upon whom she do@@ ted .
and when her sister Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah saw this , she was more corrupt in her in@@ ordinate love than she , and in her who@@ red@@ oms more than her sister in her who@@ red@@ oms .
she do@@ ted upon the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans her neighbours , cap@@ tains and rul@@ ers clo@@ th@@ ed most gor@@ ge@@ ously , hor@@ se@@ men ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses , all of them desi@@ ra@@ ble young men .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she do@@ ted upon them , and sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to them into Chal@@ de@@ a .
and the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians came to her into the bed of love , and they def@@ iled her with their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and she was pollu@@ ted with them , and her mind was ali@@ en@@ ated from them .
so she discovered her who@@ red@@ oms , and discovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess : then my mind was ali@@ en@@ ated from her , like as my mind was ali@@ en@@ ated from her sister .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her who@@ red@@ oms , in calling to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the days of her youth , where@@ in she had played the har@@ lot in the land of Egypt .
for she do@@ ted upon their param@@ ours , whose f@@ les@@ h is as the f@@ les@@ h of ass@@ es , and whose issue is like the issue of hor@@ ses .
thus th@@ ou cal@@ led@@ st to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the le@@ w@@ d@@ ness of TH@@ Y youth , in bru@@ ising TH@@ Y te@@ ats by the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for the pap@@ s of TH@@ Y youth .
there , O Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will raise up TH@@ Y lov@@ ers against the@@ e , from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated , and I will bring them against the@@ e on every side ;
they shall also stri@@ p the@@ e out of TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es , and take away TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will deliver the@@ e into the hand of them whom th@@ ou ha@@ test , into the hand of them from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated :
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast walked in the way of TH@@ Y sister ; therefore will I give her c@@ up into th@@ ine hand .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt drink of TH@@ Y sister 's c@@ up deep and large : th@@ ou s@@ halt be la@@ ug@@ hed to scor@@ n and had in der@@ ision ; it contain@@ eth much .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be filled with dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness and sor@@ row , with the c@@ up of ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment and de@@ so@@ lation , with the c@@ up of TH@@ Y sister Samar@@ ia .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and th@@ ou s@@ halt break the sh@@ er@@ ds there@@ of , and p@@ lu@@ ck off th@@ ine own bre@@ asts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
the Lord said moreover un@@ to me ; Son of man , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou judge A@@ ho@@ lah and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah ? ye@@ a , declare un@@ to them their ab@@ omin@@ ations ;
and sa@@ test upon a state@@ ly bed , and a table prepared before it , where@@ upon th@@ ou h@@ ast set mine incen@@ se and mine oil .
then said I un@@ to her that was old in ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies , Will they now commit who@@ red@@ oms with her , and she with them ?
yet they went in un@@ to her , as they go in un@@ to a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in un@@ to A@@ ho@@ lah and un@@ to Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will bring up a company upon them , and will give them to be removed and sp@@ o@@ iled .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall s@@ lay their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
and they shall re@@ compen@@ se your le@@ w@@ d@@ ness upon you , and ye shall bear the sin@@ s of your id@@ ols : and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
gather the pieces there@@ of into it , even every good piece , the th@@ igh , and the sho@@ ul@@ der ; fill it with the choice b@@ ones .
take the choice of the flock , and bur@@ n also the b@@ ones under it , and make it bo@@ il well , and let them se@@ e@@ the the b@@ ones of it there@@ in .
for her blood is in the mid@@ st of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she p@@ oured it not upon the ground , to cover it with d@@ ust ;
that it might cause fur@@ y to come up to take ven@@ ge@@ ance ; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
he@@ ap on wood , kin@@ dle the fire , consum@@ e the f@@ les@@ h , and sp@@ ice it well , and let the b@@ ones be burned .
she hat@@ h we@@ ar@@ ied her@@ self with lies , and her great sc@@ um went not forth out of her : her sc@@ um shall be in the fire .
also the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , be@@ hold , I take away from the@@ e the desire of th@@ ine eyes with a stro@@ ke : yet neither s@@ halt th@@ ou mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall TH@@ Y te@@ ars run down .
For@@ bear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bin@@ d the tire of th@@ ine head upon the@@ e , and put on TH@@ Y sho@@ es upon TH@@ Y feet , and cover not TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and eat not the bread of men .
so I sp@@ ake un@@ to the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was comman@@ ded .
and your ti@@ res shall be upon your heads , and your sho@@ es upon your feet : ye shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but ye shall p@@ ine away for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mour@@ n one toward another .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
and I will make R@@ ab@@ bah a stable for ca@@ me@@ ls , and the Am@@ mon@@ ites a cou@@ ch@@ ing@@ place for f@@ loc@@ ks : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast cla@@ pped th@@ ine hands , and st@@ amp@@ ed with the feet , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in heart with all TH@@ Y despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
un@@ to the men of the east with the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and will give them in possession , that the Am@@ mon@@ ites may not be remember@@ ed among the nations .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause that E@@ dom hat@@ h dealt against the house of Ju@@ da@@ h by taking ven@@ ge@@ ance , and hat@@ h greatly off@@ ended , and reven@@ ged himself upon them ;
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have dealt by reven@@ ge , and have taken ven@@ ge@@ ance with a desp@@ ite@@ ful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ;
and I will exec@@ ute great ven@@ ge@@ ance upon them with fur@@ ious re@@ bu@@ kes ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall lay my ven@@ ge@@ ance upon them .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and they shall destroy the walls of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and break down her tow@@ ers : I will also scrap@@ e her d@@ ust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters which are in the field shall be sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
he shall s@@ lay with the s@@ word TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the field : and he shall make a For@@ t against the@@ e , and cast a mount against the@@ e , and lift up the bu@@ ck@@ ler against the@@ e .
and he shall set eng@@ ines of war against TH@@ Y walls , and with his ax@@ es he shall break down TH@@ Y tow@@ ers .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all TH@@ Y streets : he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y people by the s@@ word , and TH@@ Y strong gar@@ ris@@ ons shall go down to the ground .
and I will cause the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y songs to ce@@ ase ; and the sound of TH@@ Y har@@ ps shall be no more heard .
and I will make the@@ e like the top of a rock : th@@ ou s@@ halt be a place to spread n@@ ets upon ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be built no more : for I the Lord have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God to T@@ y@@ ru@@ s ; shall not the is@@ les shake at the sound of TH@@ Y fall , when the wounded cry , when the sla@@ ughter is made in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ?
now shall the is@@ les tre@@ m@@ ble in the day of TH@@ Y fall ; ye@@ a , the is@@ les that are in the sea shall be troubled at TH@@ Y departure .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
TH@@ Y borders are in the mid@@ st of the seas , TH@@ Y buil@@ ders have perf@@ ected TH@@ Y beauty .
they have made all TH@@ Y ship boards of f@@ ir trees of Sen@@ ir : they have taken c@@ ed@@ ars from Lebanon to make mas@@ ts for the@@ e .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made th@@ ine o@@ ars ; the company of the As@@ hur@@ ites have made TH@@ Y ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory , brought out of the is@@ les of Ch@@ it@@ tim .
fine lin@@ en with bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was that which th@@ ou sp@@ re@@ ade@@ st forth to be TH@@ Y sa@@ il ; blue and pur@@ ple from the is@@ les of E@@ lis@@ ha@@ h was that which covered the@@ e .
the inhabitants of Z@@ id@@ on and Ar@@ v@@ ad were TH@@ Y mar@@ in@@ ers : TH@@ Y wise men , O T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , that were in the@@ e , were TH@@ Y pil@@ ots .
the an@@ ci@@ ents of Ge@@ bal and the wise men there@@ of were in the@@ e TH@@ Y c@@ alk@@ ers : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in the@@ e to occup@@ y TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
they of Per@@ sia and of Lu@@ d and of Ph@@ ut were in th@@ ine army , TH@@ Y men of war : they han@@ ged the shield and hel@@ met in the@@ e ; they set forth TH@@ Y co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon TH@@ Y walls round about , and the G@@ am@@ ma@@ di@@ ms were in TH@@ Y tow@@ ers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon TH@@ Y walls round about ; they have made TH@@ Y beauty perfect .
Jav@@ an , T@@ ub@@ al , and Mes@@ h@@ ech , they were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts : they tra@@ ded the persons of men and vessels of br@@ ass in TH@@ Y market .
the men of D@@ ed@@ an were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts ; many is@@ les were the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of th@@ ine hand : they brought the@@ e for a present hor@@ ns of Iv@@ ory and eb@@ ony .
Ju@@ da@@ h , and the land of Israel , they were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts : they tra@@ ded in TH@@ Y market wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and P@@ ann@@ a@@ g , and hon@@ ey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they occupied with the@@ e in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats : in these were they TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts .
the mer@@ chan@@ ts of She@@ ba and Ra@@ am@@ ah , they were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts : they occupied in TH@@ Y fairs with chief of all sp@@ ices , and with all pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and gold .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish did sing of the@@ e in TH@@ Y market : and th@@ ou w@@ ast rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the mid@@ st of the seas .
TH@@ Y ro@@ wers have brought the@@ e into great waters : the east wind hat@@ h broken the@@ e in the mid@@ st of the seas .
the subur@@ bs shall shake at the sound of the cry of TH@@ Y pil@@ ots .
and all that handle the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , and all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against the@@ e , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust upon their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves ut@@ ter@@ ly bal@@ d for the@@ e , and gir@@ d them with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and they shall we@@ ep for the@@ e with bit@@ ter@@ ness of heart and bitter w@@ ailing .
when TH@@ Y war@@ es went forth out of the seas , th@@ ou fil@@ led@@ st many people ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st en@@ rich the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches and of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
in the time when th@@ ou s@@ halt be broken by the seas in the dep@@ ths of the waters TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and all TH@@ Y company in the mid@@ st of the@@ e shall fall .
all the inhabitants of the is@@ les shall be ast@@ on@@ ished at the@@ e , and their kings shall be sor@@ e afraid , they shall be troubled in their coun@@ tenance .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
be@@ hold , th@@ ou art wis@@ er than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from the@@ e :
with TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and with th@@ ine understanding th@@ ou h@@ ast gotten the@@ e ri@@ ches , and h@@ ast gotten gold and silver into TH@@ Y treasures :
by TH@@ Y great wis@@ dom and by TH@@ Y traffic@@ k h@@ ast th@@ ou increased TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and th@@ ine heart is lifted up because of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches :
be@@ hold , therefore I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers upon the@@ e , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring the@@ e down to the p@@ it , and th@@ ou s@@ halt die the deaths of them that are sla@@ in in the mid@@ st of the seas .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou yet say before him that s@@ lay@@ eth the@@ e , I am God ? but th@@ ou s@@ halt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that s@@ lay@@ eth the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt die the deaths of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
T@@ ho@@ u art the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set the@@ e so : th@@ ou w@@ ast upon the hol@@ y mountain of God ; th@@ ou h@@ ast walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ ast perfect in TH@@ Y ways from the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast created , ti@@ ll in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity was found in the@@ e .
for I will send into her p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be jud@@ ged in the mid@@ st of her by the s@@ word upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and there shall be no more a pri@@ cking bri@@ er un@@ to the house of Israel , nor any gri@@ ev@@ ing Th@@ or@@ n of all that are round about them , that desp@@ ised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twel@@ f@@ th day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , set TH@@ Y face against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against him , and against all Egypt :
and all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord , because they have been a staff of Re@@ ed to the house of Israel .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will bring a s@@ word upon the@@ e , and cut off man and be@@ ast out of the@@ e .
and the land of Egypt shall be de@@ so@@ late and waste ; and they shall know that I am the Lord : because he hat@@ h said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
no fo@@ ot of man shall pass through it , nor fo@@ ot of be@@ ast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited for@@ ty years .
yet thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; At the end of for@@ ty years will I gather the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans from the people w@@ hi@@ ther they were sc@@ at@@ tered :
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their habi@@ tation ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour where@@ with he served against it , because they w@@ rought for me , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
in that day will I cause the Hor@@ n of the house of Israel to bu@@ d forth , and I will give the@@ e the opening of the m@@ outh in the mid@@ st of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
for the day is near , even the day of the Lord is near , a cl@@ ou@@ dy day ; it shall be the time of the he@@ a@@ then .
and the s@@ word shall come upon Egypt , and great p@@ ain shall be in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , when the sla@@ in shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multi@@ tude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; They also that up@@ hold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the to@@ wer of S@@ yen@@ e shall they fall in it by the s@@ word , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and they shall be de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities shall be in the mid@@ st of the cities that are was@@ ted .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her hel@@ pers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid , and great p@@ ain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it co@@ me@@ th .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will also make the multi@@ tude of Egypt to ce@@ ase by the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he and his people with him , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sla@@ in .
and I will make P@@ ath@@ ros de@@ so@@ late , and will set fire in Zo@@ an , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in No .
and I will p@@ our my fur@@ y upon sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multi@@ tude of No .
and I will set fire in Egypt : sin shall have great p@@ ain , and No shall be rent as@@ under , and N@@ op@@ h shall have dist@@ resses daily .
the young men of Av@@ en and of P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ bes@@ eth shall fall by the s@@ word : and these cities shall go into cap@@ tivity .
thus will I exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in Egypt : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and disper@@ se them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
be@@ hold , the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an was a c@@ ed@@ ar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shad@@ owing sh@@ ro@@ ud , and of an high stat@@ ure ; and his top was among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
therefore his he@@ ight was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and his branches became long because of the multi@@ tude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en made their nes@@ ts in his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and under his branches did all the be@@ asts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
thus was he fair in his gre@@ at@@ ness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
I have made him fair by the multi@@ tude of his branches : so that all the trees of E@@ den , that were in the gar@@ den of God , en@@ vi@@ ed him .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the he@@ a@@ then ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him : I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
upon his ru@@ in shall all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en remain , and all the be@@ asts of the field shall be upon his branches :
they also went down into hell with him un@@ to them that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the he@@ a@@ then .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will therefore spread out my net over the@@ e with a company of many people ; and they shall bring the@@ e up in my net .
and I will lay TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h upon the mountains , and fill the val@@ ley@@ s with TH@@ Y he@@ ight .
I will also water with TH@@ Y blood the land where@@ in th@@ ou swim@@ me@@ st , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of the@@ e .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; The s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall come upon the@@ e .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause TH@@ Y multi@@ tude to fall , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , all of them : and they shall sp@@ oil the pom@@ p of Egypt , and all the multi@@ tude there@@ of shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all the be@@ asts there@@ of from bes@@ ide the great waters ; neither shall the fo@@ ot of man trouble them any more , nor the ho@@ of@@ s of be@@ asts trouble them .
then will I make their waters deep , and cause their rivers to run like oil , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late , and the country shall be de@@ stitute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
this is the lament@@ ation where@@ with they shall la@@ ment her : the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the nations shall la@@ ment her : they shall la@@ ment for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multi@@ tude , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
it came to pass also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , un@@ to the ne@@ ther parts of the ear@@ th , with them that go down into the p@@ it .
they shall fall in the mid@@ st of them that are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : she is delivered to the s@@ word : draw her and all her multi@@ tu@@ des .
As@@ sh@@ ur is there and all her company : his graves are about him : all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word :
whose graves are set in the sides of the p@@ it , and her company is round about her grave : all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all her multi@@ tude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be broken in the mid@@ st of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and s@@ halt lie with them that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
there is E@@ dom , her kings , and all her pr@@ inces , which with their might are laid by them that were sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with them that go down to the p@@ it .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multi@@ tude , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his army sla@@ in by the s@@ word , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
if when he se@@ eth the s@@ word come upon the land , he blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and warn the people ;
then wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he@@ aret@@ h the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and tak@@ eth not warning ; if the s@@ word come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
he heard the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him . but he that tak@@ eth warning shall deliver his sou@@ l .
so th@@ ou , O son of man , I have set the@@ e a watch@@ man un@@ to the house of Israel ; therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt hear the word at my m@@ outh , and warn them from me .
nevertheless , if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
again , when I say un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is law@@ ful and right ;
none of his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed shall be mentioned un@@ to him : he hat@@ h done that which is law@@ ful and right ; he shall su@@ rely live .
yet the children of TH@@ Y people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked turn from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall live there@@ by .
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ e eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your id@@ ols , and shed blood : and shall ye poss@@ ess the land ?
Y@@ e stand upon your s@@ word , ye work ab@@ omin@@ ation , and ye def@@ ile every one his neighbour 's wife : and shall ye poss@@ ess the land ?
for I will lay the land most de@@ so@@ late , and the pom@@ p of her strength shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most de@@ so@@ late because of all their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
and when this co@@ me@@ th to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a pro@@ phe@@ t hat@@ h been among them .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there is no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : and they became meat to all the be@@ asts of the field , when they were sc@@ at@@ tered .
my she@@ ep w@@ and@@ ered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill : ye@@ a , my flock was sc@@ at@@ tered upon all the face of the ear@@ th , and none did search or seek after them .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I , even I , will both search my she@@ ep , and seek them out .
I will fe@@ ed them in a good pas@@ ture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will fe@@ ed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and as for you , O my flock , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I judge between c@@ attle and c@@ attle , between the r@@ ams and the he go@@ ats .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have tro@@ dden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to them ; be@@ hold , I , even I , will judge between the f@@ at c@@ attle and between the le@@ an c@@ attle .
because ye have th@@ rust with side and with sho@@ ul@@ der , and pushed all the dis@@ eased with your hor@@ ns , ti@@ ll ye have sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad ;
therefore will I save my flock , and they shall no more be a pre@@ y ; and I will judge between c@@ attle and c@@ attle .
and I will set up one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d over them , and he shall fe@@ ed them , even my ser@@ vant David ; he shall fe@@ ed them , and he shall be their she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause the ev@@ il be@@ asts to ce@@ ase out of the land : and they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in his season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
and they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the he@@ a@@ then , neither shall the be@@ ast of the land dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with hunger in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more .
thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
and say un@@ to it , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , O mount Se@@ ir , I am against the@@ e , and I will stretch out mine hand against the@@ e , and I will make the@@ e most de@@ so@@ late .
I will lay TH@@ Y cities waste , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be de@@ so@@ late , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord .
therefore , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , I will prepare the@@ e un@@ to blood , and blood shall pursue the@@ e : s@@ ith th@@ ou h@@ ast not ha@@ ted blood , even blood shall pursue the@@ e .
thus will I make mount Se@@ ir most de@@ so@@ late , and cut off from it him that pass@@ eth out and him that retur@@ net@@ h .
and I will fill his mountains with his sla@@ in men : in TH@@ Y hil@@ ls , and in TH@@ Y val@@ ley@@ s , and in all TH@@ Y rivers , shall they fall that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
I will make the@@ e perpet@@ ual de@@ so@@ lations , and TH@@ Y cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all TH@@ Y b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid de@@ so@@ late , they are given us to consum@@ e .
thus with your m@@ outh ye have bo@@ asted against me , and have multi@@ p@@ lied your words against me : I have heard them .
also , th@@ ou son of man , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y un@@ to the mountains of Israel , and say , Y@@ e mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I have lifted up mine hand , su@@ rely the he@@ a@@ then that are about you , they shall bear their sh@@ ame .
for , be@@ hold , I am for you , and I will turn un@@ to you , and ye shall be til@@ led and so@@ wn :
and I will multi@@ ply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the was@@ tes shall be buil@@ ded :
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , when the house of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their own land , they def@@ iled it by their own way and by their do@@ ings : their way was before me as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of a removed woman .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I p@@ oured my fur@@ y upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their id@@ ols where@@ with they had pollu@@ ted it :
and I sc@@ at@@ tered them among the he@@ a@@ then , and they were disper@@ sed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I jud@@ ged them .
but I had p@@ ity for mine hol@@ y name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they went .
for I will take you from among the he@@ a@@ then , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you an heart of f@@ les@@ h .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and ye shall keep my judg@@ ments , and do them .
and ye shall d@@ well in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers ; and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will also save you from all your un@@ cle@@ ann@@ esses : and I will call for the cor@@ n , and will increase it , and lay no fam@@ ine upon you .
and I will multi@@ ply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more re@@ pro@@ ach of fam@@ ine among the he@@ a@@ then .
then shall ye remember your own ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
not for your sak@@ es do I this , sa@@ ith the Lord God , be it known un@@ to you : be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to d@@ well in the cities , and the was@@ tes shall be buil@@ ded .
and the de@@ so@@ late land shall be til@@ led , whereas it lay de@@ so@@ late in the sight of all that passed by .
and they shall say , This land that was de@@ so@@ late is become like the gar@@ den of E@@ den ; and the waste and de@@ so@@ late and ru@@ ined cities are become f@@ enced , and are inhabited .
then the he@@ a@@ then that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ru@@ ined places , and plant that that was de@@ so@@ late : I the Lord have spoken it , and I will do it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will yet for this be inqu@@ ired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them ; I will increase them with men like a flock .
as the hol@@ y flock , as the flock of Jer@@ usalem in her so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ loc@@ ks of men : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley which was full of b@@ ones ,
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , be@@ hold , there were very many in the open val@@ ley ; and , lo , they were very d@@ ry .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to these b@@ ones ; be@@ hold , I will cause bre@@ ath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sin@@ ews upon you , and will bring up f@@ les@@ h upon you , and cover you with s@@ kin , and put bre@@ ath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
so I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied as I was comman@@ ded : and as I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , there was a no@@ ise , and be@@ hold a shak@@ ing , and the b@@ ones came together , bone to his bone .
and when I be@@ held , lo , the sin@@ ews and the f@@ les@@ h came up upon them , and the s@@ kin covered them above : but there was no bre@@ ath in them .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it , and performed it , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word of the Lord came again un@@ to me , saying ,
and when the children of TH@@ Y people shall speak un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Wil@@ t th@@ ou not she@@ w us what th@@ ou mean@@ est by these ?
and the sti@@ cks where@@ on th@@ ou wri@@ test shall be in th@@ ine hand before their eyes .
and David my ser@@ vant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : they shall also walk in my judg@@ ments , and observe my stat@@ utes , and do them .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle also shall be with them : ye@@ a , I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I the Lord do sanc@@ ti@@ fy Israel , when my sanc@@ tu@@ ary shall be in the mid@@ st of them for ever@@ more .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , set TH@@ Y face against Go@@ g , the land of Mag@@ o@@ g , the chief pr@@ ince of Mes@@ h@@ ech and T@@ ub@@ al , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against him ,
be th@@ ou prepared , and prepare for th@@ y@@ self , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y company that are assemb@@ led un@@ to the@@ e , and be th@@ ou a guard un@@ to them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt as@@ cen@@ d and come like a storm , th@@ ou s@@ halt be like a cl@@ oud to cover the land , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y bands , and many people with the@@ e .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; It shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into TH@@ Y mind , and th@@ ou s@@ halt think an ev@@ il thought :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come from TH@@ Y place out of the north parts , th@@ ou , and many people with the@@ e , all of them ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses , a great company , and a m@@ igh@@ ty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that my fur@@ y shall come up in my face .
for in my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and in the fire of my wr@@ ath have I spoken , su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shak@@ ing in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a s@@ word against him throughout all my mountains , sa@@ ith the Lord God : every man 's s@@ word shall be against his brother .
therefore , th@@ ou son of man , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against Go@@ g , and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , O Go@@ g , the chief pr@@ ince of Mes@@ h@@ ech and T@@ ub@@ al :
and I will sm@@ ite TH@@ Y bo@@ w out of TH@@ Y left hand , and will cause th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws to fall out of TH@@ Y right hand .
and I will send a fire on Mag@@ o@@ g , and among them that d@@ well car@@ ele@@ ss@@ ly in the is@@ les : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
be@@ hold , it is come , and it is done , sa@@ ith the Lord God ; this is the day where@@ of I have spoken .
and seven months shall the house of Israel be bur@@ ying of them , that they may cleans@@ e the land .
Ye@@ a , all the people of the land shall bur@@ y them ; and it shall be to them a ren@@ own the day that I shall be gl@@ ori@@ fied , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and ye shall eat f@@ at ti@@ ll ye be full , and drink blood ti@@ ll ye be dr@@ un@@ ken , of my sacrifice which I have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for you .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots , with m@@ igh@@ ty men , and with all men of war , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and I will set my gl@@ ory among the he@@ a@@ then , and all the he@@ a@@ then shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid upon them .
so the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions have I done un@@ to them , and hi@@ d my face from them .
after that they have bor@@ ne their sh@@ ame , and all their t@@ res@@ passes where@@ by they have t@@ res@@ passed against me , when they d@@ wel@@ t saf@@ ely in their land , and none made them afraid .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enem@@ ies ' lands , and am sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them un@@ to their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
neither will I hide my face any more from them : for I have p@@ oured out my spirit upon the house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and every little chamber was one Re@@ ed long , and one Re@@ ed broad ; and between the little ch@@ ambers were five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate within was one Re@@ ed .
he meas@@ ured also the por@@ ch of the gate within , one Re@@ ed .
then meas@@ ured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the posts there@@ of , two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was in@@ ward .
and he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th of the entry of the gate , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the length of the gate , thir@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he meas@@ ured then the gate from the ro@@ of of one little chamber to the ro@@ of of another : the b@@ read@@ th was five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , door against door .
he made also posts of thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , even un@@ to the post of the court round about the gate .
and from the face of the gate of the entrance un@@ to the face of the por@@ ch of the in@@ ner gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then brought he me into the ou@@ tw@@ ard court , and , lo , there were ch@@ ambers , and a pav@@ ement made for the court round about : thirty ch@@ ambers were upon the pav@@ ement .
and the pav@@ ement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pav@@ ement .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate un@@ to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court without , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts eas@@ tw@@ ard and nor@@ th@@ ward .
and the gate of the ou@@ tw@@ ard court that looked toward the north , he meas@@ ured the length there@@ of , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of .
and the gate of the in@@ ner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he meas@@ ured from gate to gate an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
after that he brought me toward the south , and be@@ hold a gate toward the south : and he meas@@ ured the posts there@@ of and the ar@@ ches there@@ of according to these measures .
and there were windows in it and in the ar@@ ches there@@ of round about , like those windows : the length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them : and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts there@@ of .
and he brought me to the in@@ ner court by the south gate : and he meas@@ ured the south gate according to these measures ;
and he brought me into the in@@ ner court toward the east : and he meas@@ ured the gate according to these measures .
and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were toward the ou@@ tw@@ ard court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of , the posts there@@ of , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of , and the windows to it round about : the length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and in the por@@ ch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to s@@ lay there@@ on the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sin offering and the t@@ res@@ pass offering .
and at the side without , as one go@@ eth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , where@@ upon they sle@@ w their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
so he meas@@ ured the court , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , fo@@ ur@@ square ; and the alt@@ ar that was before the house .
after@@ ward he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
so he meas@@ ured the length there@@ of , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the b@@ read@@ th , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , before the temp@@ le : and he said un@@ to me , This is the most hol@@ y place .
after he meas@@ ured the wall of the house , six cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the b@@ read@@ th of every side chamber , four cu@@ bi@@ ts , round about the house on every side .
I saw also the he@@ ight of the house round about : the foundations of the side ch@@ ambers were a full Re@@ ed of six great cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall , which was for the side chamber without , was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and that which was left was the place of the side ch@@ ambers that were within .
and the doors of the side ch@@ ambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick round about , and the length there@@ of n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
so he meas@@ ured the house , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls there@@ of , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts long ;
also the b@@ read@@ th of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and it was made with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees , so that a pal@@ m tree was between a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b and a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b ; and every ch@@ er@@ u@@ b had two faces ;
so that the face of a man was toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
from the ground un@@ to above the door were ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees made , and on the wall of the temp@@ le .
the posts of the temp@@ le were s@@ quar@@ ed , and the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
and the doors had two leaves ap@@ i@@ ece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side ch@@ ambers of the house , and th@@ ick plan@@ ks .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
before the length of an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts was the north door , and the b@@ read@@ th was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
over against the twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts which were for the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which was for the ut@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and before the ch@@ ambers was a walk of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts b@@ read@@ th in@@ ward , a way of one cu@@ bit ; and their doors toward the north .
now the up@@ per ch@@ ambers were shorter : for the gal@@ ler@@ ies were higher than these , than the lower , and than the mid@@ d@@ lem@@ ost of the building .
for they were in three stories , but had not pil@@ lars as the pil@@ lars of the courts : therefore the building was stra@@ it@@ ened more than the lowest and the mid@@ d@@ lem@@ ost from the ground .
and the wall that was without over against the ch@@ ambers , toward the ut@@ ter court on the fore@@ part of the ch@@ ambers , the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
for the length of the ch@@ ambers that were in the ut@@ ter court was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and , lo , before the temp@@ le were an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the ch@@ ambers were in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
he meas@@ ured the east side with the measuring Re@@ ed , five hundred re@@ eds , with the measuring Re@@ ed round about .
he meas@@ ured the north side , five hundred re@@ eds , with the measuring Re@@ ed round about .
he meas@@ ured the south side , five hundred re@@ eds , with the measuring Re@@ ed .
he turned about to the west side , and meas@@ ured five hundred re@@ eds with the measuring Re@@ ed .
after@@ ward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east :
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a no@@ ise of many waters : and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the in@@ ner court ; and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house .
and I heard him speaking un@@ to me out of the house ; and the man stood by me .
now let them put away their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the car@@ cases of their kings , far from me , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of them for ever .
this is the law of the house ; U@@ p@@ on the top of the mountain the whole limit there@@ of round about shall be most hol@@ y . be@@ hold , this is the law of the house .
and he said un@@ to me , Son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; These are the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the alt@@ ar in the day when they shall make it , to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on , and to sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le blood there@@ on .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes that be of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , which approach un@@ to me , to minister un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord God , a young bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt take the bul@@ lock also of the sin offering , and he shall bur@@ n it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
and on the second day th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a k@@ id of the go@@ ats without ble@@ mis@@ h for a sin offering ; and they shall cleans@@ e the alt@@ ar , as they did cleans@@ e it with the bul@@ lock .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of cleansing it , th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer them before the Lord , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
seven days s@@ halt th@@ ou prepare every day a go@@ at for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bul@@ lock , and a ram out of the flock , without ble@@ mis@@ h .
then he brought me back the way of the gate of the ou@@ tw@@ ard sanc@@ tu@@ ary which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east ; and it was shut .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say to the rebel@@ li@@ ous , even to the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel , let it su@@ ffic@@ e you of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations ,
and ye have not kept the charge of mine hol@@ y things : but ye have set ke@@ epers of my charge in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; No st@@ ran@@ ger , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart , nor un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , of any st@@ ran@@ ger that is among the children of Israel .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes that are gone away far from me , when Israel went as@@ tra@@ y , which went as@@ tra@@ y away from me after their id@@ ols ; they shall even bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but I will make them ke@@ epers of the charge of the house , for all the service there@@ of , and for all that shall be done there@@ in .
they shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister un@@ to me , and they shall keep my charge .
they shall have lin@@ en bon@@ n@@ ets upon their heads , and shall have lin@@ en bre@@ eches upon their lo@@ ins ; they shall not gir@@ d themselves with any thing that ca@@ us@@ eth swe@@ at .
neither shall they s@@ have their heads , nor suffer their loc@@ ks to grow long ; they shall only poll their heads .
neither shall any pri@@ est drink wine , when they enter into the in@@ ner court .
and they shall te@@ ach my people the difference between the hol@@ y and prof@@ ane , and cause them to dis@@ cer@@ n between the un@@ clean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judg@@ ments : and they shall keep my laws and my stat@@ utes in all mine assemb@@ lies ; and they shall hal@@ low my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths .
and after he is cleans@@ ed , they shall rec@@ k@@ on un@@ to him seven days .
and in the day that he go@@ eth into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , un@@ to the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and it shall be un@@ to them for an inher@@ it@@ ance : I am their inher@@ it@@ ance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
they shall eat the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the t@@ res@@ pass offering ; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be the@@ ir@@ s .
of this there shall be for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary five hundred in length , with five hundred in b@@ read@@ th , square round about ; and fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts round about for the subur@@ bs there@@ of .
and of this measure s@@ halt th@@ ou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the b@@ read@@ th of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the most hol@@ y place .
Y@@ e shall have just balan@@ ces , and a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just b@@ ath . I
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the b@@ ath shall be of one measure , that the b@@ ath may contain the tenth part of an Ho@@ mer , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Ho@@ mer : the measure there@@ of shall be after the Ho@@ mer .
this is the ob@@ lation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of an Ho@@ mer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of an Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley :
concerning the ordin@@ ance of oil , the b@@ ath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , which is an Ho@@ mer of ten ba@@ ths ; for ten ba@@ ths are an Ho@@ mer :
all the people of the land shall give this ob@@ lation for the pr@@ ince in Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , th@@ ou s@@ halt take a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and so th@@ ou s@@ halt do the seventh day of the month for every one that er@@ re@@ th , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconc@@ ile the house .
in the first month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , ye shall have the pass@@ over , a feast of seven days ; un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten .
and upon that day shall the pr@@ ince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to the Lord , seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a k@@ id of the go@@ ats daily for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ep@@ ha@@ h for a bul@@ lock , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and an hin of oil for an ep@@ ha@@ h .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord in the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths and in the new mo@@ ons .
and the bur@@ n@@ t offering that the pr@@ ince shall offer un@@ to the Lord in the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day shall be six lam@@ bs without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and the meat offering shall be an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and the meat offering for the lam@@ bs as he shall be able to give , and an hin of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram : they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way there@@ of .
and the pr@@ ince in the mid@@ st of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt daily prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord of a lam@@ b of the first year without ble@@ mis@@ h : th@@ ou s@@ halt prepare it every morning .
thus shall they prepare the lam@@ b , and the meat offering , and the oil , every morning for a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering .
in the four cor@@ ners of the court there were courts joined of for@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long and thirty broad : these four cor@@ ners were of one measure .
and there was a row of building round about in them , round about them four , and it was made with bo@@ iling places under the ro@@ ws round about .
then said he un@@ to me , These are the places of them that bo@@ il , where the ministers of the house shall bo@@ il the sacrifice of the people .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me about the way without un@@ to the ut@@ ter gate by the way that lo@@ ok@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and , be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eas@@ tw@@ ard , he meas@@ ured a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the an@@ c@@ les .
again he meas@@ ured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the k@@ ne@@ es . again he meas@@ ured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the lo@@ ins .
after@@ ward he meas@@ ured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to sw@@ im in , a river that could not be passed over .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
but the mir@@ y places there@@ of and the mar@@ is@@ hes there@@ of shall not be he@@ aled ; they shall be given to salt .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; This shall be the border , where@@ by ye shall inher@@ it the land according to the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : Joseph shall have two por@@ tions .
and ye shall inher@@ it it , one as well as another : concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it un@@ to your fa@@ thers : and this land shall fall un@@ to you for inher@@ it@@ ance .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , as men go to Z@@ ed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ o@@ th@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Hazar @@@ -@@ @ hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the coast of H@@ aur@@ an .
and the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , from Tam@@ ar even to the waters of stri@@ fe in K@@ ade@@ sh , the river to the great sea . and this is the south side sou@@ th@@ ward .
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , ti@@ ll a man come over against Ham@@ ath . this is the west side .
and it shall come to pass , that in what tri@@ be the st@@ ran@@ ger so@@ journ@@ eth , there shall ye give him his inher@@ it@@ ance , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and by the border of As@@ her , from the east side even un@@ to the west side , a portion for Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
the ob@@ lation that ye shall offer un@@ to the Lord shall be of five and twenty thousand in length , and of ten thousand in b@@ read@@ th .
it shall be for the pri@@ ests that are sanc@@ ti@@ fied of the sons of Zad@@ ok ; which have kept my charge , which went not as@@ tra@@ y when the children of Israel went as@@ tra@@ y , as the L@@ evi@@ tes went as@@ tra@@ y .
and over against the border of the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in b@@ read@@ th : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the b@@ read@@ th ten thousand .
and the subur@@ bs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred and fif@@ ty .
and they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar un@@ to the waters of stri@@ fe in K@@ ade@@ sh , and to the river toward the great sea .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot un@@ to the tri@@ bes of Israel for inher@@ it@@ ance , and these are their por@@ tions , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred , with their three gates ; one gate of G@@ ad , one gate of As@@ her , one gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
in the third year of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he d@@ rank : so no@@ ur@@ ishing them three years , that at the end there@@ of they might stand before the king .
un@@ to whom the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names : for he gave un@@ to Daniel the name of Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , of Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s .
then let our coun@@ ten@@ ances be looked upon before the@@ e , and the coun@@ tenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as th@@ ou se@@ est , deal with TH@@ Y servants .
and at the end of ten days their coun@@ ten@@ ances appeared fa@@ i@@ rer and fat@@ ter in f@@ les@@ h than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
as for these four children , God gave them knowledge and sk@@ ill in all learning and wis@@ dom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dre@@ ams .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
and the king commun@@ ed with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , Mis@@ ha@@ el , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah : therefore stood they before the king .
and in all matters of wis@@ dom and understanding , that the king inqu@@ ired of them , he found them ten times better than all the mag@@ ic@@ ians and astr@@ olog@@ ers that were in all his real@@ m .
and in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar dre@@ amed dre@@ ams , where@@ with his spirit was troubled , and his sle@@ ep br@@ ake from him .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the astr@@ olog@@ ers , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for to she@@ w the king his dre@@ ams . so they came and stood before the king .
but if ye she@@ w the dream , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of , ye shall receive of me gifts and re@@ wards and great honour : therefore she@@ w me the dream , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
the king answ@@ ered and said , I know of certain@@ ty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
and it is a rare thing that the king require@@ th , and there is none other that can she@@ w it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
for this cause the king was angry and very fur@@ ious , and comman@@ ded to destroy all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the decree went forth that the wise men should be sla@@ in ; and they sought Daniel and his fel@@ lows to be sla@@ in .
then Daniel answ@@ ered with coun@@ sel and wis@@ dom to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to s@@ lay the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
he answ@@ ered and said to Ari@@ o@@ ch the king 's captain , Wh@@ y is the decree so has@@ ty from the king ? then Ari@@ o@@ ch made the thing known to Daniel .
then Daniel went in , and desi@@ red of the king that he would give him time , and that he would she@@ w the king the interpre@@ tation .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , Mis@@ ha@@ el , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , his compan@@ ions :
that they would desire mer@@ cies of the God of heav@@ en concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his fel@@ lows should not per@@ ish with the rest of the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then was the secret revealed un@@ to Daniel in a night vision . then Daniel b@@ les@@ sed the God of heav@@ en .
and he chan@@ get@@ h the times and the se@@ as@@ ons : he remov@@ eth kings , and set@@ te@@ th up kings : he gi@@ vet@@ h wis@@ dom un@@ to the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding :
he reve@@ al@@ eth the deep and secret things : he know@@ eth what is in the d@@ ark@@ ness , and the light d@@ wel@@ le@@ th with him .
then Ari@@ o@@ ch brought in Daniel before the king in has@@ te and said thus un@@ to him , I have found a man of the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , that will make known un@@ to the king the interpre@@ tation .
the king answ@@ ered and said to Daniel , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , Art th@@ ou able to make known un@@ to me the dream which I have seen , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of ?
Daniel answ@@ ered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hat@@ h demanded can@@ not the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , she@@ w un@@ to the king ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts , and mak@@ eth known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . TH@@ Y dream , and the visions of TH@@ Y head upon TH@@ Y bed , are these ;
T@@ ho@@ u , O king , sa@@ west , and be@@ hold a great image . this great image , whose bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was excellent , stood before the@@ e ; and the form there@@ of was ter@@ ri@@ ble .
this image 's head was of fine gold , his bre@@ ast and his arms of silver , his bel@@ ly and his th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
T@@ ho@@ u sa@@ west ti@@ ll that a stone was cut out without hands , which smo@@ te the image upon his feet that were of iron and cla@@ y , and br@@ ake them to pieces .
T@@ ho@@ u , O king , art a king of kings : for the God of heav@@ en hat@@ h given the@@ e a k@@ ing@@ dom , power , and strength , and gl@@ ory .
and the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron : for@@ as@@ much as iron break@@ eth in pieces and sub@@ du@@ eth all things : and as iron that break@@ eth all these , shall it break in pieces and bru@@ ise .
and as the to@@ es of the feet were part of iron , and part of cla@@ y , so the k@@ ing@@ dom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
then the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar fell upon his face , and wor@@ shi@@ pped Daniel , and comman@@ ded that they should offer an ob@@ lation and swe@@ et o@@ do@@ urs un@@ to him .
then Daniel requested of the king , and he set Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , over the affairs of the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on : but Daniel sat in the gate of the king .
and wh@@ os@@ o fal@@ le@@ th not down and wor@@ ship@@ pet@@ h shall the same hour be cast into the mid@@ st of a burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore at that time certain Chal@@ de@@ ans came near , and accused the Jews .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar in his ra@@ ge and fur@@ y comman@@ ded to bring Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go . then they brought these men before the king .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sp@@ ake and said un@@ to them , Is it true , O Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , do not ye serve my go@@ ds , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , answ@@ ered and said to the king , O Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , we are not careful to answer the@@ e in this matter .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace , and he will deliver us out of th@@ ine hand , O king .
but if not , be it known un@@ to the@@ e , O king , that we will not serve TH@@ Y go@@ ds , nor worship the golden image which th@@ ou h@@ ast set up .
and he comman@@ ded the most m@@ igh@@ ty men that were in his army to bin@@ d Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , and to cast them into the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
then these men were bound in their co@@ ats , their hos@@ en , and their hat@@ s , and their other gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
therefore because the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment was urgent , and the fur@@ n@@ ace exceeding hot , the fla@@ me of the fire sle@@ w those men that took up Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
and these three men , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , fell down bound into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
how great are his signs ! and how m@@ igh@@ ty are his won@@ ders ! his k@@ ing@@ dom is an ever@@ lasting k@@ ing@@ dom , and his domin@@ ion is from generation to generation .
I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the th@@ ou@@ ghts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and be@@ hold a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th , and the he@@ ight there@@ of was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the he@@ ight there@@ of reached un@@ to heav@@ en , and the sight there@@ of to the end of all the ear@@ th :
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , be@@ hold , a wat@@ cher and an hol@@ y one came down from heav@@ en ;
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a be@@ ast 's heart be given un@@ to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that th@@ ou sa@@ west , which grew , and was strong , whose he@@ ight reached un@@ to the heav@@ en , and the sight there@@ of to all the ear@@ th ;
it is th@@ ou , O king , that art grown and become strong : for TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness is grown , and reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to heav@@ en , and TH@@ Y domin@@ ion to the end of the ear@@ th .
this is the interpre@@ tation , O king , and this is the decree of the most High , which is come upon my lor@@ d the king :
and whereas they comman@@ ded to leave the st@@ um@@ p of the tree roots ; TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom shall be sure un@@ to the@@ e , after that th@@ ou s@@ halt have known that the heav@@ ens do rule .
at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the king sp@@ ake , and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , that I have built for the house of the k@@ ing@@ dom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from heav@@ en , saying , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to the@@ e it is spoken ; The k@@ ing@@ dom is depar@@ ted from the@@ e .
Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lor@@ ds , and d@@ rank wine before the thousand .
they d@@ rank wine , and praised the go@@ ds of gold , and of silver , of br@@ ass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the cand@@ le@@ stick upon the pla@@ ister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's coun@@ tenance was changed , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him , so that the join@@ ts of his lo@@ ins were lo@@ os@@ ed , and his k@@ ne@@ es smo@@ te one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
I have even heard of the@@ e , that the spirit of the go@@ ds is in the@@ e , and that light and understanding and excellent wis@@ dom is found in the@@ e .
O th@@ ou king , the most high God gave Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar TH@@ Y father a k@@ ing@@ dom , and maj@@ es@@ ty , and gl@@ ory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind har@@ dened in pride , he was de@@ posed from his k@@ ingly th@@ r@@ one , and they took his gl@@ ory from him :
then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and this writing was written .
Peres ; Th@@ y k@@ ing@@ dom is divided , and given to the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with scar@@ let , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made a proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
and Dar@@ i@@ us the medi@@ an took the k@@ ing@@ dom , being about thre@@ es@@ core and two years old .
it pleased Dar@@ i@@ us to set over the k@@ ing@@ dom an hundred and twenty pr@@ inces , which should be over the whole k@@ ing@@ dom ;
and over these three presidents ; of whom Daniel was first : that the pr@@ inces might give accounts un@@ to them , and the king should have no damage .
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and pr@@ inces , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole real@@ m .
then said these men , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , which alter@@ eth not .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he la@@ b@@ oured ti@@ ll the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then these men assemb@@ led un@@ to the king , and said un@@ to the king , K@@ now , O king , that the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans is , That no decree nor statute which the king establis@@ het@@ h may be changed .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . now the king sp@@ ake and said un@@ to Daniel , Th@@ y God whom th@@ ou serv@@ est continu@@ ally , he will deliver the@@ e .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting : neither were instruments of musi@@ ck brought before him : and his sle@@ ep went from him .
then the king ar@@ ose very early in the morning , and went in has@@ te un@@ to the den of li@@ ons .
in the first year of Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
and four great be@@ asts came up from the sea , di@@ verse one from another .
after this I be@@ held , and lo another , like a Le@@ op@@ ard , which had upon the back of it four w@@ ings of a fo@@ w@@ l ; the be@@ ast had also four heads ; and domin@@ ion was given to it .
a fi@@ ery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands minist@@ ered un@@ to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I be@@ held then because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n sp@@ ake : I be@@ held even ti@@ ll the be@@ ast was sla@@ in , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning fla@@ me .
as concerning the rest of the be@@ asts , they had their domin@@ ion taken away : yet their lives were prol@@ on@@ ged for a season and time .
I saw in the night visions , and , be@@ hold , one like the Son of man came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en , and came to the An@@ cient of days , and they brought him near before him .
I Daniel was gri@@ ev@@ ed in my spirit in the mid@@ st of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near un@@ to one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpre@@ tation of the things .
these great be@@ asts , which are four , are four kings , which shall arise out of the ear@@ th .
but the sa@@ ints of the most High shall take the k@@ ing@@ dom , and poss@@ ess the k@@ ing@@ dom for ever , even for ever and ever .
I be@@ held , and the same Hor@@ n made war with the sa@@ ints , and prev@@ ailed against them ;
until the An@@ cient of days came , and judgment was given to the sa@@ ints of the most High ; and the time came that the sa@@ ints poss@@ essed the k@@ ing@@ dom .
but the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his domin@@ ion , to consum@@ e and to destroy it un@@ to the end .
in the third year of the reign of king Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar a vision appeared un@@ to me , even un@@ to me Daniel , after that which appeared un@@ to me at the first .
and as I was considering , be@@ hold , an he go@@ at came from the west on the face of the whole ear@@ th , and touched not the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two hor@@ ns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran un@@ to him in the fur@@ y of his power .
therefore the he go@@ at wa@@ xed very great : and when he was strong , the great Hor@@ n was broken ; and for it came up four no@@ table ones toward the four winds of heav@@ en .
and out of one of them came forth a little Hor@@ n , which wa@@ xed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleas@@ ant land .
and it wa@@ xed great , even to the host of heav@@ en ; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and st@@ amp@@ ed upon them .
Ye@@ a , he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself even to the pr@@ ince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of trans@@ gres@@ sion , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practi@@ sed , and prosp@@ ered .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
and I heard a man 's voice between the banks of U@@ la@@ i , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sle@@ ep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me u@@ pri@@ ght .
and the roug@@ h go@@ at is the king of G@@ rec@@ ia : and the great Hor@@ n that is between his eyes is the first king .
now that being broken , whereas four stood up for it , four k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms shall stand up out of the nation , but not in his power .
and in the latter time of their k@@ ing@@ dom , when the trans@@ gres@@ sors are come to the full , a king of fierce coun@@ tenance , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
and his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er , and practi@@ se , and shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty and the hol@@ y people .
and I set my face un@@ to the Lord God , to seek by pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation , with fas@@ ting , and s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and ashes :
we have sin@@ ned , and have committed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly , and have rebel@@ led , even by depar@@ ting from TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts and from TH@@ Y judg@@ ments :
neither have we hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , which sp@@ ake in TH@@ Y name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
O Lord , to us belon@@ get@@ h conf@@ usion of face , to our kings , to our pr@@ inces , and to our fa@@ thers , because we have sin@@ ned against the@@ e .
neither have we obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
therefore hat@@ h the Lord watched upon the ev@@ il , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he do@@ eth : for we obe@@ yed not his voice .
now therefore , O our God , hear the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and his supp@@ lic@@ ations , and cause TH@@ Y face to sh@@ ine upon TH@@ Y sanc@@ tu@@ ary that is de@@ so@@ late , for the Lord 's sake .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , for@@ give ; O Lord , he@@ arken and do ; def@@ er not , for th@@ ine own sake , O my God : for TH@@ Y city and TH@@ Y people are called by TH@@ Y name .
and wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking , and pray@@ ing , and conf@@ essing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord my God for the hol@@ y mountain of my God ;
Ye@@ a , wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking in pray@@ er , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening ob@@ lation .
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give the@@ e sk@@ ill and understanding .
I ate no pleas@@ ant bread , neither came f@@ les@@ h nor wine in my m@@ outh , neither did I ano@@ int myself at all , ti@@ ll three whole weeks were fulfilled .
and in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is H@@ idde@@ kel ;
then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold a certain man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , whose lo@@ ins were gir@@ ded with fine gold of U@@ p@@ haz :
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
and , be@@ hold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my k@@ ne@@ es and upon the pal@@ ms of my hands .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
now I am come to make the@@ e understand what shall be@@ fall TH@@ Y people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days .
and when he had spoken such words un@@ to me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dum@@ b .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there bre@@ ath left in me .
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me ,
then said he , K@@ now@@ est th@@ ou where@@ fore I come un@@ to the@@ e ? and now will I return to fight with the pr@@ ince of Per@@ sia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the pr@@ ince of G@@ rec@@ ia shall come .
but I will she@@ w the@@ e that which is noted in the s@@ crip@@ ture of truth : and there is none that hol@@ de@@ th with me in these things , but Michael your pr@@ ince .
and a m@@ igh@@ ty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great domin@@ ion , and do according to his will .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
so the king of the south shall come into his k@@ ing@@ dom , and shall return into his own land .
and when he hat@@ h taken away the multi@@ tude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multi@@ tude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much ri@@ ches .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the rob@@ bers of TH@@ Y people shall ex@@ alt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but he that co@@ me@@ th against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the g@@ lor@@ ious land , which by his hand shall be consu@@ med .
then he shall turn his face toward the For@@ t of his own land : but he shall st@@ um@@ ble and fall , and not be found .
and in his estate shall stand up a v@@ ile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in peac@@ e@@ ably , and obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be over@@ flo@@ wn from before him , and shall be broken ; ye@@ a , also the pr@@ ince of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and after the league made with him he shall work dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
Ye@@ a , they that fe@@ ed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall over@@ flow : and many shall fall down sla@@ in .
and both these kings ' hear@@ ts shall be to do mis@@ chief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosp@@ er : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great ri@@ ches ; and his heart shall be against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do explo@@ its , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
and such as do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly against the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall he corrupt by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do explo@@ its .
and they that understand among the people shall instruc@@ t many : yet they shall fall by the s@@ word , and by fla@@ me , by cap@@ tivity , and by sp@@ oil , many days .
now when they shall fall , they shall be hol@@ p@@ en with a little help : but many shall cle@@ ave to them with f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
neither shall he regard the God of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d : for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many countries shall be over@@ thrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt : and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
but ti@@ dings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fur@@ y to destroy , and ut@@ ter@@ ly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of his palace between the seas in the g@@ lor@@ ious hol@@ y mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and many of them that sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th shall aw@@ ake , some to ever@@ lasting life , and some to sh@@ ame and ever@@ lasting con@@ temp@@ t .
and they that be wise shall sh@@ ine as the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the fir@@ mam@@ ent ; and they that turn many to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the stars for ever and ever .
but th@@ ou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and se@@ al the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and f@@ ro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , be@@ hold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and he said , G@@ o TH@@ Y way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed ti@@ ll the time of the end .
many shall be pur@@ ified , and made white , and tried ; but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly : and none of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days .
b@@ les@@ sed is he that w@@ ai@@ te@@ th , and co@@ me@@ th to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that I will break the bo@@ w of Israel in the val@@ ley of J@@ ez@@ reel .
and she conce@@ ived again , and b@@ are a daughter . and God said un@@ to him , C@@ all her name L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ ru@@ ham@@ ah : for I will no more have mer@@ cy upon the house of Israel ; but I will ut@@ ter@@ ly take them away .
but I will have mer@@ cy upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bo@@ w , nor by s@@ word , nor by battle , by hor@@ ses , nor by hor@@ se@@ men .
then shall the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
p@@ lead with your mother , p@@ lead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her who@@ red@@ oms out of her sight , and her ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies from between her bre@@ asts ;
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and s@@ lay her with thir@@ st .
and I will not have mer@@ cy upon her children ; for they be the children of who@@ red@@ oms .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will h@@ edge up TH@@ Y way with thor@@ ns , and make a wall , that she shall not find her p@@ aths .
for she did not know that I gave her cor@@ n , and wine , and oil , and multi@@ p@@ lied her silver and gold , which they prepared for Ba@@ al .
therefore will I return , and take away my cor@@ n in the time there@@ of , and my wine in the season there@@ of , and will rec@@ over my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x given to cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and now will I discover her le@@ w@@ d@@ ness in the sight of her lov@@ ers , and none shall deliver her out of mine hand .
I will also cause all her mir@@ th to ce@@ ase , her feast days , her new mo@@ ons , and her sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and all her so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ al@@ im , where@@ in she burned incen@@ se to them , and she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and she went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will al@@ l@@ ure her , and bring her into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and speak comfor@@ tably un@@ to her .
for I will take away the names of Ba@@ al@@ im out of her m@@ outh , and they shall no more be remember@@ ed by their name .
and I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me for ever ; ye@@ a , I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and in judgment , and in lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , and in mer@@ cies .
I will even bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me in fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness : and th@@ ou s@@ halt know the Lord .
and it shall come to pass in that day , I will hear , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will hear the heav@@ ens , and they shall hear the ear@@ th ;
so I bought her to me for fif@@ teen pieces of silver , and for an Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley , and an half Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley :
and I said un@@ to her , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt abide for me many days ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not play the har@@ lot , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not be for another man : so will I also be for the@@ e .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a pr@@ ince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ep@@ ho@@ d , and without ter@@ ap@@ him :
after@@ ward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the Lord their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the Lord and his Go@@ od@@ ness in the latter days .
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mer@@ cy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mour@@ n , and every one that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in shall langu@@ ish , with the be@@ asts of the field , and with the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ; ye@@ a , the fis@@ hes of the sea also shall be taken away .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou fall in the day , and the pro@@ phe@@ t also shall fall with the@@ e in the night , and I will destroy TH@@ Y mother .
and there shall be , like people , like pri@@ est : and I will punish them for their ways , and reward them their do@@ ings .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask coun@@ sel at their sto@@ cks , and their staff declar@@ eth un@@ to them : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms hat@@ h caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , nor your sp@@ ous@@ es when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery : for themselves are separated with who@@ res , and they sacrifice with har@@ lots : therefore the people that do@@ th not understand shall fall .
their drink is s@@ our : they have committed wh@@ ore@@ dom continu@@ ally : her rul@@ ers with sh@@ ame do love , Gi@@ ve ye .
the wind hat@@ h bound her up in her w@@ ings , and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med because of their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
and the revol@@ ters are pro@@ found to make sla@@ ughter , though I have been a re@@ bu@@ ker of them all .
they will not frame their do@@ ings to turn un@@ to their God : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms is in the mid@@ st of them , and they have not known the Lord .
and the pride of Israel do@@ th testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fall in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; Ju@@ da@@ h also shall fall with them .
they shall go with their f@@ loc@@ ks and with their her@@ ds to seek the Lord ; but they shall not find him ; he hat@@ h withdrawn himself from them .
blow ye the cor@@ net in Gi@@ be@@ ah , and the tr@@ ump@@ et in Ram@@ ah : cry al@@ oud at Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en , after the@@ e , O Benjamin .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be de@@ so@@ late in the day of re@@ bu@@ ke : among the tri@@ bes of Israel have I made known that which shall su@@ rely be .
the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will p@@ our out my wr@@ ath upon them like water .
therefore will I be un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im as a mo@@ th , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h as rot@@ ten@@ ness .
come , and let us return un@@ to the Lord : for he hat@@ h torn , and he will he@@ al us ; he hat@@ h s@@ mit@@ ten , and he will bin@@ d us up .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come un@@ to us as the rain , as the latter and former rain un@@ to the ear@@ th .
O E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , what shall I do un@@ to the@@ e ? O Ju@@ da@@ h , what shall I do un@@ to the@@ e ? for your Go@@ od@@ ness is as a morning cl@@ oud , and as the early dew it go@@ eth away .
therefore have I he@@ wed them by the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; I have sla@@ in them by the words of my m@@ outh : and TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are as the light that go@@ eth forth .
G@@ il@@ e@@ ad is a city of them that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and is pollu@@ ted with blood .
and as troops of rob@@ bers wait for a man , so the company of pri@@ ests murder in the way by consent : for they commit le@@ w@@ d@@ ness .
I have seen an hor@@ ri@@ ble thing in the house of Israel : there is the wh@@ ore@@ dom of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Israel is def@@ iled .
when I would have he@@ aled Israel , then the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was discovered , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Samar@@ ia : for they commit fal@@ se@@ hood ; and the th@@ i@@ ef co@@ me@@ th in , and the troop of rob@@ bers sp@@ o@@ il@@ eth without .
and they consider not in their hear@@ ts that I remember all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : now their own do@@ ings have bes@@ et them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the pr@@ inces with their lies .
they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , as an ov@@ en heated by the Bak@@ er , who ce@@ as@@ eth from raising after he hat@@ h k@@ needed the d@@ ough , until it be le@@ av@@ ened .
in the day of our king the pr@@ inces have made him si@@ ck with bott@@ les of wine ; he stret@@ ched out his hand with scor@@ ners .
for they have made ready their heart like an ov@@ en , wh@@ il@@ es they lie in wait : their Bak@@ er sle@@ ep@@ eth all the night ; in the morning it bur@@ net@@ h as a f@@ laming fire .
they are all hot as an ov@@ en , and have dev@@ oured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that cal@@ le@@ th un@@ to me .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , he hat@@ h mixed himself among the people ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is a c@@ ake not turned .
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he know@@ eth it not : ye@@ a , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there upon him , yet he know@@ eth not .
and the pride of Israel testi@@ fi@@ eth to his face : and they do not return to the Lord their God , nor seek him for all this .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en ; I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their Con@@ gre@@ gation hat@@ h heard .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them ! for they have fled from me : destruction un@@ to them ! because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : though I have re@@ deemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
and they have not cri@@ ed un@@ to me with their heart , when they ho@@ w@@ led upon their beds : they assem@@ ble themselves for cor@@ n and wine , and they rebel against me .
set the tr@@ ump@@ et to TH@@ Y m@@ outh . he shall come as an e@@ ag@@ le against the house of the Lord , because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and t@@ res@@ passed against my law .
Israel hat@@ h cast off the thing that is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
TH@@ Y cal@@ f , O Samar@@ ia , hat@@ h cast the@@ e off ; mine an@@ ger is kin@@ d@@ led against them : how long will it be ER@@ E they at@@ tain to inno@@ cen@@ cy ?
for from Israel was it also : the work@@ man made it ; therefore it is not God : but the cal@@ f of Samar@@ ia shall be broken in pieces .
for they are gone up to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , a wild ass alone by himself : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im hat@@ h hired lov@@ ers .
Ye@@ a , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sor@@ row a little for the burden of the king of pr@@ inces .
I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a st@@ range thing .
for Israel hat@@ h forgotten his Mak@@ er , and buil@@ de@@ th temp@@ les ; and Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h multi@@ p@@ lied f@@ enced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of .
re@@ jo@@ ice not , O Israel , for joy , as other people : for th@@ ou h@@ ast gone a wh@@ oring from TH@@ Y God , th@@ ou h@@ ast lov@@ ed a reward upon every cor@@ n@@ floor .
they shall not d@@ well in the Lord 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat un@@ clean things in As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
what will ye do in the so@@ lem@@ n day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
the watch@@ man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was with my God : but the pro@@ phe@@ t is a sn@@ are of a fo@@ w@@ ler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
they have deeply cor@@ rupted themselves , as in the days of Gi@@ be@@ ah : therefore he will remember their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , he will visit their sin@@ s .
as for E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , their gl@@ ory shall fly away like a bird , from the birth , and from the w@@ om@@ b , and from the concep@@ tion .
though they bring up their children , yet will I ber@@ e@@ ave them , that there shall not be a man left : ye@@ a , wo@@ e also to them when I de@@ part from them !
all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al : for there I ha@@ ted them : for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their do@@ ings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their pr@@ inces are revol@@ ters .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is s@@ mit@@ ten , their root is dri@@ ed up , they shall bear no fruit : ye@@ a , though they bring forth , yet will I s@@ lay even the bel@@ ov@@ ed fruit of their w@@ om@@ b .
my God will cast them away , because they did not he@@ arken un@@ to him : and they shall be w@@ ander@@ ers among the nations .
Israel is an empty v@@ ine , he br@@ ing@@ eth forth fruit un@@ to himself : according to the multi@@ tude of his fruit he hat@@ h increased the al@@ tar@@ s ; according to the Go@@ od@@ ness of his land they have made good@@ ly images .
their heart is divided ; now shall they be found fa@@ ulty : he shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , he shall sp@@ oil their images .
it shall be also carried un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a for a present to king J@@ are@@ b : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall receive sh@@ ame , and Israel shall be as@@ ha@@ med of his own coun@@ sel .
it is in my desire that I should ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bin@@ d themselves in their two fur@@ ro@@ ws .
so@@ w to yo@@ ur@@ selves in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ ap in mer@@ cy ; break up your f@@ allow ground : for it is time to seek the Lord , ti@@ ll he come and rain righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness upon you .
Y@@ e have p@@ low@@ ed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , ye have re@@ ap@@ ed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; ye have e@@ aten the fruit of lies : because th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st trust in TH@@ Y way , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty men .
therefore shall a t@@ um@@ ult arise among TH@@ Y people , and all TH@@ Y for@@ t@@ resses shall be sp@@ o@@ iled , as S@@ hal@@ man sp@@ o@@ iled Beth @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ bel in the day of battle : the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces upon her children .
when Israel was a child , then I lov@@ ed him , and called my son out of Egypt .
as they called them , so they went from them : they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to Ba@@ al@@ im , and burned incen@@ se to Gra@@ ven images .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yok@@ e on their j@@ a@@ ws , and I laid meat un@@ to them .
he shall not return into the land of Egypt , but the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall be his king , because they refused to return .
and the s@@ word shall abide on his cities , and shall consum@@ e his branches , and dev@@ our them , because of their own coun@@ sels .
and my people are b@@ ent to back@@ sli@@ ding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would ex@@ alt him .
they shall walk after the Lord : he shall ro@@ ar like a lion : when he shall ro@@ ar , then the children shall tre@@ m@@ ble from the west .
they shall tre@@ m@@ ble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will place them in their houses , sa@@ ith the Lord .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fe@@ ede@@ th on wind , and follow@@ eth after the east wind : he daily increas@@ eth lies and de@@ so@@ lation ; and they do make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , and oil is carried into Egypt .
the Lord hat@@ h also a controversy with Ju@@ da@@ h , and will punish Jac@@ o@@ b according to his ways ; according to his do@@ ings will he re@@ compen@@ se him .
he took his brother by the he@@ el in the w@@ om@@ b , and by his strength he had power with God :
he is a mer@@ chan@@ t , the balan@@ ces of dec@@ e@@ it are in his hand : he lov@@ eth to op@@ press .
and I that am the Lord TH@@ Y God from the land of Egypt will yet make the@@ e to d@@ well in tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les , as in the days of the so@@ lem@@ n feast .
I have also spoken by the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and I have multi@@ p@@ lied visions , and used si@@ milit@@ u@@ des , by the ministry of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
is there in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ? su@@ rely they are van@@ ity : they sacrifice bul@@ loc@@ ks in G@@ ilg@@ al ; ye@@ a , their al@@ tar@@ s are as he@@ aps in the fur@@ ro@@ ws of the fields .
and Jac@@ o@@ b fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept she@@ ep .
and by a pro@@ phe@@ t the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a pro@@ phe@@ t was he preserved .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im provoked him to an@@ ger most bit@@ ter@@ ly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his re@@ pro@@ ach shall his Lord return un@@ to him .
when E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im sp@@ ake tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , he ex@@ al@@ ted himself in Israel ; but when he off@@ ended in Ba@@ al , he died .
therefore they shall be as the morning cl@@ oud , and as the early dew that pass@@ eth away , as the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
yet I am the Lord TH@@ Y God from the land of Egypt , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know no go@@ d but me : for there is no sa@@ vi@@ our bes@@ ide me .
according to their pas@@ ture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was ex@@ al@@ ted ; therefore have they forgotten me .
I will meet them as a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her whel@@ ps , and will ren@@ d the ca@@ ul of their heart , and there will I dev@@ our them like a lion : the wild be@@ ast shall tear them .
I will be TH@@ Y king : where is any other that may save the@@ e in all TH@@ Y cities ? and TH@@ Y judges of whom th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , Gi@@ ve me a king and pr@@ inces ?
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman shall come upon him : he is an un@@ wise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
Samar@@ ia shall become de@@ so@@ late ; for she hat@@ h rebel@@ led against her God : they shall fall by the s@@ word : their inf@@ ants shall be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ri@@ pped up .
I will be as the dew un@@ to Israel : he shall grow as the L@@ ily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon .
his branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and his s@@ me@@ ll as Lebanon .
they that d@@ well under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the cor@@ n , and grow as the v@@ ine : the s@@ cent there@@ of shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? pru@@ dent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall fall there@@ in .
the word of the Lord that came to Jo@@ el the son of P@@ eth@@ uel .
hear this , ye old men , and give e@@ ar , all ye inhabitants of the land . H@@ ath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fa@@ thers ?
that which the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m hat@@ h left hat@@ h the loc@@ ust e@@ aten ; and that which the loc@@ ust hat@@ h left hat@@ h the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m e@@ aten ; and that which the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m hat@@ h left hat@@ h the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler e@@ aten .
aw@@ ake , ye dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds , and we@@ ep ; and ho@@ w@@ l , all ye drin@@ kers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your m@@ outh .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose te@@ eth are the te@@ eth of a lion , and he hat@@ h the che@@ ek te@@ eth of a great lion .
he hat@@ h laid my v@@ ine waste , and bar@@ ked my fi@@ g tree : he hat@@ h made it clean b@@ are , and cast it away ; the branches there@@ of are made white .
the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord ; the pri@@ ests , the Lord 's ministers , mour@@ n .
the field is was@@ ted , the land mour@@ net@@ h ; for the cor@@ n is was@@ ted : the new wine is dri@@ ed up , the oil langu@@ is@@ het@@ h .
San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy ye a fast , call a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , gather the el@@ ders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry un@@ to the Lord ,
A@@ las for the day ! for the day of the Lord is at hand , and as a destruction from the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty shall it come .
is not the meat cut off before our eyes , ye@@ a , joy and gla@@ d@@ ness from the house of our God ?
the se@@ ed is rot@@ ten under their clo@@ ds , the gar@@ ners are laid de@@ so@@ late , the bar@@ ns are broken down ; for the cor@@ n is with@@ ered .
how do the be@@ asts gro@@ an ! the her@@ ds of c@@ attle are per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed , because they have no pas@@ ture ; ye@@ a , the f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep are made de@@ so@@ late .
O Lord , to the@@ e will I cry : for the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me hat@@ h burned all the trees of the field .
the be@@ asts of the field cry also un@@ to the@@ e : for the rivers of waters are dri@@ ed up , and the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
a fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th before them ; and behind them a fla@@ me bur@@ net@@ h : the land is as the gar@@ den of E@@ den before them , and behind them a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; ye@@ a , and nothing shall escape them .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of hor@@ ses ; and as hor@@ se@@ men , so shall they run .
like the no@@ ise of char@@ i@@ ots on the tops of mountains shall they le@@ ap , like the no@@ ise of a fla@@ me of fire that dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th the st@@ ub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
neither shall one th@@ rust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the s@@ word , they shall not be wounded .
they shall run to and f@@ ro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall clim@@ b up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a th@@ i@@ ef .
the ear@@ th shall quake before them ; the heav@@ ens shall tre@@ m@@ ble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their sh@@ ining :
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your gar@@ ments , and turn un@@ to the Lord your God : for he is gr@@ ac@@ ious and mer@@ ci@@ ful , slow to an@@ ger , and of great kin@@ d@@ ness , and re@@ pen@@ te@@ th him of the ev@@ il .
who know@@ eth if he will return and rep@@ ent , and leave a b@@ les@@ sing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering un@@ to the Lord your God ?
gather the people , sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Con@@ gre@@ gation , assem@@ ble the el@@ ders , gather the children , and those that su@@ ck the bre@@ asts : let the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om go forth of his chamber , and the bri@@ de out of her clos@@ et .
then will the Lord be Je@@ al@@ ous for his land , and p@@ ity his people .
and the flo@@ ors shall be full of wheat , and the f@@ ats shall over@@ flow with wine and oil .
and I will restore to you the years that the loc@@ ust hat@@ h e@@ aten , the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m , and the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler , and the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hat@@ h dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and ye shall know that I am in the mid@@ st of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and also upon the servants and upon the hand@@ ma@@ ids in those days will I p@@ our out my spirit .
and I will she@@ w won@@ ders in the heav@@ ens and in the ear@@ th , blood , and fire , and pil@@ lars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into d@@ ark@@ ness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the ter@@ ri@@ ble day of the Lord come .
for , be@@ hold , in those days , and in that time , when I shall bring again the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ,
and they have cast lots for my people ; and have given a boy for an har@@ lot , and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temp@@ les my good@@ ly pleas@@ ant things :
the children also of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem have ye sold un@@ to the Gre@@ cians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
be@@ hold , I will raise them out of the place w@@ hi@@ ther ye have sold them , and will return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head :
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hand of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall sell them to the Sab@@ e@@ ans , to a people far off : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
procla@@ im ye this among the Gen@@ ti@@ les ; Pre@@ par@@ e war , wake up the m@@ igh@@ ty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , and come , all ye he@@ a@@ then , and gather yo@@ ur@@ selves together round about : th@@ ither cause TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty ones to come down , O Lord .
let the he@@ a@@ then be w@@ ak@@ ened , and come up to the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : for there will I sit to judge all the he@@ a@@ then round about .
put ye in the si@@ ck@@ le , for the har@@ v@@ est is ri@@ pe : come , get you down ; for the press is full , the f@@ ats over@@ flow ; for their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is great .
multi@@ tu@@ des , multi@@ tu@@ des in the val@@ ley of decision : for the day of the Lord is near in the val@@ ley of decision .
the sun and the moon shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed , and the stars shall withdraw their sh@@ ining .
Egypt shall be a de@@ so@@ lation , and E@@ dom shall be a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , for the violence against the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
for I will cleans@@ e their blood that I have not cleans@@ ed : for the Lord d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Z@@ ion .
and he said , The Lord will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the habi@@ tations of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ mel shall wi@@ ther .
but I will send a fire into the house of Haz@@ a@@ el , which shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they carried away cap@@ tive the whole cap@@ tivity , to deliver them up to E@@ dom :
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of :
and I will cut off the inhabi@@ tant from Ash@@ do@@ d , and him that hol@@ de@@ th the scep@@ tre from Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and I will turn mine hand against E@@ kr@@ on : and the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines shall per@@ ish , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they delivered up the whole cap@@ tivity to E@@ dom , and remember@@ ed not the bro@@ ther@@ ly C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a temp@@ est in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
but I will send a fire upon Mo@@ a@@ b , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces of Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th : and Mo@@ a@@ b shall die with t@@ um@@ ult , with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et :
and I will cut off the judge from the mid@@ st there@@ of , and will s@@ lay all the pr@@ inces there@@ of with him , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they sold the righ@@ te@@ ous for silver , and the poor for a pair of sho@@ es ;
that p@@ ant after the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the me@@ ek : and a man and his father will go in un@@ to the same ma@@ id , to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name :
and they lay themselves down upon clo@@ th@@ es laid to pledge by every alt@@ ar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their go@@ d .
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you for@@ ty years through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , to poss@@ ess the land of the Am@@ or@@ ite .
and I raised up of your sons for pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of your young men for N@@ azar@@ ites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore the flight shall per@@ ish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the m@@ igh@@ ty deliver himself :
neither shall he stand that hand@@ le@@ th the bo@@ w ; and he that is swift of fo@@ ot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that ri@@ de@@ th the hor@@ se deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hat@@ h spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
will a lion ro@@ ar in the forest , when he hat@@ h no pre@@ y ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
can a bird fall in a sn@@ are upon the ear@@ th , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a sn@@ are from the ear@@ th , and have taken nothing at all ?
shall a tr@@ ump@@ et be blo@@ wn in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be ev@@ il in a city , and the Lord hat@@ h not done it ?
the lion hat@@ h ro@@ ar@@ ed , who will not fear ? the Lord God hat@@ h spoken , who can but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ?
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; A@@ n ad@@ versary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down TH@@ Y strength from the@@ e , and TH@@ Y pal@@ aces shall be sp@@ o@@ iled .
that in the day that I shall visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel upon him I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l : and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and I will sm@@ ite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of Iv@@ ory shall per@@ ish , and the great houses shall have an end , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the Lord God hat@@ h sworn by his hol@@ iness , that , lo , the days shall come upon you , that he will take you away with ho@@ oks , and your poster@@ ity with fis@@ h@@ ho@@ oks .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and offer a sacrifice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving with le@@ av@@ en , and procla@@ im and publish the free offer@@ ings : for this lik@@ eth you , O ye children of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and I also have given you cle@@ ann@@ ess of te@@ eth in all your cities , and want of bread in all your places : yet have ye not returned un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
so two or three cities w@@ and@@ ered un@@ to one city , to drink water ; but they were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
I have s@@ mit@@ ten you with b@@ lasting and mil@@ dew : when your gar@@ den@@ s and your v@@ ine@@ yards and your fi@@ g trees and your olive trees increased , the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m dev@@ oured them : yet have ye not returned un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore thus will I do un@@ to the@@ e , O Israel : and because I will do this un@@ to the@@ e , prepare to meet TH@@ Y God , O Israel .
hear ye this word which I take up against you , even a lament@@ ation , O house of Israel .
the vir@@ gin of Israel is fallen ; she shall no more rise : she is for@@ sak@@ en upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
seek the Lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and dev@@ our it , and there be none to qu@@ en@@ ch it in Be@@ the@@ l .
that strength@@ en@@ eth the sp@@ o@@ iled against the strong , so that the sp@@ o@@ iled shall come against the fortress .
they h@@ ate him that re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h in the gate , and they ab@@ h@@ or him that speak@@ eth u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly .
for I know your manif@@ old trans@@ gres@@ sions and your m@@ igh@@ ty sin@@ s : they aff@@ lic@@ t the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
seek good , and not ev@@ il , that ye may live : and so the Lord , the God of hosts , shall be with you , as ye have spoken .
h@@ ate the ev@@ il , and love the good , and establish judgment in the gate : it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the re@@ mn@@ ant of Joseph .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you that desire the day of the Lord ! to what end is it for you ? the day of the Lord is d@@ ark@@ ness , and not light .
as if a man did flee from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house , and le@@ an@@ ed his hand on the wall , and a ser@@ p@@ ent bit him .
though ye offer me bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and your meat offer@@ ings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offer@@ ings of your f@@ at be@@ asts .
take th@@ ou away from me the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y songs ; for I will not hear the me@@ lo@@ dy of TH@@ Y viol@@ s .
Wo@@ e to them that are at ease in Z@@ ion , and trust in the mountain of Samar@@ ia , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
pass ye un@@ to Cal@@ ne@@ h , and see ; and from th@@ ence go ye to Ham@@ ath the great : then go down to G@@ ath of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : be they better than these k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ? or their border greater than your border ?
that lie upon beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves upon their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
that chan@@ t to the sound of the vi@@ ol , and inv@@ ent to themselves instruments of musi@@ ck , like David ;
that drink wine in bo@@ w@@ ls , and ano@@ int themselves with the chief o@@ in@@ tments : but they are not gri@@ ev@@ ed for the aff@@ li@@ ction of Joseph .
therefore now shall they go cap@@ tive with the first that go cap@@ tive , and the ban@@ qu@@ et of them that stret@@ ched themselves shall be removed .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord comman@@ de@@ th , and he will sm@@ ite the great house with breaches , and the little house with cle@@ fts .
shall hor@@ ses run upon the rock ? will one plo@@ w there with ox@@ en ? for ye have turned judgment into g@@ all , and the fruit of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness into hem@@ lock :
thus hat@@ h the Lord God she@@ wed un@@ to me ; and , be@@ hold , he formed gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mo@@ w@@ ings .
thus hat@@ h the Lord God she@@ wed un@@ to me : and , be@@ hold , the Lord God called to conten@@ d by fire , and it dev@@ oured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
and the high places of I@@ sa@@ ac shall be de@@ so@@ late , and the sanc@@ tu@@ aries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am with the s@@ word .
but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y not again any more at Be@@ the@@ l : for it is the king 's chap@@ el , and it is the king 's court .
then answ@@ ered Am@@ os , and said to A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , I was no pro@@ phe@@ t , neither was I a pro@@ phe@@ t 's son ; but I was an her@@ d@@ man , and a gather@@ er of sy@@ com@@ ore fruit :
and the Lord took me as I followed the flock , and the Lord said un@@ to me , G@@ o , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y un@@ to my people Israel .
now therefore hear th@@ ou the word of the Lord : T@@ ho@@ u say@@ est , Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y not against Israel , and drop not TH@@ Y word against the house of I@@ sa@@ ac .
and the songs of the temp@@ le shall be ho@@ w@@ lings in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord God : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with sil@@ ence .
hear this , O ye that sw@@ allow up the ne@@ edy , even to make the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the ne@@ edy for a pair of sho@@ es ; ye@@ a , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that I will send a fam@@ ine in the land , not a fam@@ ine of bread , nor a thir@@ st for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord :
though they di@@ g into hell , th@@ ence shall mine hand take them ; though they clim@@ b up to heav@@ en , th@@ ence will I bring them down :
and though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enem@@ ies , th@@ ence will I command the s@@ word , and it shall s@@ lay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for ev@@ il , and not for good .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as cor@@ n is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least gra@@ in fall upon the ear@@ th .
in that day will I raise up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches there@@ of ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
that they may poss@@ ess the re@@ mn@@ ant of E@@ dom , and of all the he@@ a@@ then , which are called by my name , sa@@ ith the Lord that do@@ eth this .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that the p@@ low@@ man shall over@@ take the re@@ aper , and the tre@@ ader of grap@@ es him that so@@ w@@ eth se@@ ed ; and the mountains shall drop swe@@ et wine , and all the hil@@ ls shall mel@@ t .
and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , sa@@ ith the Lord TH@@ Y God .
though th@@ ou ex@@ alt th@@ y@@ self as the e@@ ag@@ le , and though th@@ ou set TH@@ Y n@@ est among the stars , th@@ ence will I bring the@@ e down , sa@@ ith the Lord .
shall I not in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , even destroy the wise men out of E@@ dom , and understanding out of the mount of E@@ sa@@ u ?
and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty men , O Tem@@ an , shall be dis@@ may@@ ed , to the end that every one of the mount of E@@ sa@@ u may be cut off by sla@@ ughter .
for the day of the Lord is near upon all the he@@ a@@ then : as th@@ ou h@@ ast done , it shall be done un@@ to the@@ e : TH@@ Y reward shall return upon th@@ ine own head .
but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a m@@ igh@@ ty temp@@ est in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; and I fear the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , which hat@@ h made the sea and the d@@ ry land .
then said they un@@ to him , What shall we do un@@ to the@@ e , that the sea may be calm un@@ to us ? for the sea w@@ rought , and was temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous .
nevertheless the men ro@@ wed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea w@@ rought , and was temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous against them .
so they took up Jon@@ ah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ce@@ ased from her ra@@ ging .
then Jon@@ ah pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord his God out of the fish 's bel@@ ly ,
and said , I cri@@ ed by reason of mine aff@@ li@@ ction un@@ to the Lord , and he heard me ; out of the bel@@ ly of hell cri@@ ed I , and th@@ ou hear@@ dest my voice .
for th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st cast me into the deep , in the mid@@ st of the seas ; and the floods comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : all TH@@ Y bil@@ lows and TH@@ Y waves passed over me .
the waters comp@@ ass@@ ed me about , even to the sou@@ l : the dep@@ th closed me round about , the we@@ eds were wrapped about my head .
I went down to the bott@@ oms of the mountains ; the ear@@ th with her bars was about me for ever : yet h@@ ast th@@ ou brought up my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
when my sou@@ l fa@@ in@@ ted within me I remember@@ ed the Lord : and my pray@@ er came in un@@ to the@@ e , into th@@ ine hol@@ y temp@@ le .
but I will sacrifice un@@ to the@@ e with the voice of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving ; I will pay that that I have vowed . sal@@ vation is of the Lord .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jon@@ ah the second time , saying ,
so Jon@@ ah ar@@ ose , and went un@@ to N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , according to the word of the Lord . now N@@ inev@@ e@@ h was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey .
and Jon@@ ah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cri@@ ed , and said , Y@@ et for@@ ty days , and N@@ inev@@ e@@ h shall be over@@ thrown .
so the people of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came un@@ to the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and he laid his ro@@ be from him , and covered him with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but it disp@@ le@@ ased Jon@@ ah exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and he was very angry .
therefore now , O Lord , take , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the shadow , ti@@ ll he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a go@@ ur@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his gri@@ ef . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the go@@ ur@@ d .
but God prepared a wor@@ m when the morning rose the next day , and it smo@@ te the go@@ ur@@ d that it with@@ ered .
then said the Lord , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast had p@@ ity on the go@@ ur@@ d , for the which th@@ ou h@@ ast not la@@ b@@ oured , neither ma@@ dest it grow ; which came up in a night , and per@@ ished in a night :
the word of the Lord that came to Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ as@@ th@@ ite in the days of Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which he saw concerning Samar@@ ia and Jer@@ usalem .
hear , all ye people ; he@@ arken , O ear@@ th , and all that there@@ in is : and let the Lord God be witness against you , the Lord from his hol@@ y temp@@ le .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord co@@ me@@ th forth out of his place , and will come down , and tre@@ ad upon the high places of the ear@@ th .
and the mountains shall be m@@ ol@@ ten under him , and the val@@ ley@@ s shall be cle@@ ft , as wa@@ x before the fire , and as the waters that are p@@ oured down a steep place .
therefore I will make Samar@@ ia as an he@@ ap of the field , and as plan@@ t@@ ings of a v@@ ine@@ yard : and I will p@@ our down the stones there@@ of into the val@@ ley , and I will discover the foundations there@@ of .
therefore I will wa@@ il and ho@@ w@@ l , I will go stri@@ pped and nak@@ ed : I will make a w@@ ailing like the dra@@ g@@ ons , and mourning as the ow@@ ls .
for her wo@@ und is inc@@ ur@@ able ; for it is come un@@ to Ju@@ da@@ h ; he is come un@@ to the gate of my people , even to Jer@@ usalem .
declare ye it not at G@@ ath , we@@ ep ye not at all : in the house of A@@ ph@@ ra@@ h rol@@ l th@@ y@@ self in the d@@ ust .
pass ye away , th@@ ou inhabi@@ tant of Sap@@ hir , having TH@@ Y sh@@ ame nak@@ ed : the inhabi@@ tant of Za@@ anan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ el ; he shall receive of you his standing .
for the inhabi@@ tant of Mar@@ o@@ th w@@ aited carefully for good : but ev@@ il came down from the Lord un@@ to the gate of Jer@@ usalem .
O th@@ ou inhabi@@ tant of L@@ ach@@ ish , bin@@ d the char@@ i@@ ot to the swift be@@ ast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Z@@ ion : for the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel were found in the@@ e .
make the@@ e bal@@ d , and poll the@@ e for TH@@ Y de@@ licate children ; en@@ large TH@@ Y bal@@ d@@ ness as the e@@ ag@@ le ; for they are gone into cap@@ tivity from the@@ e .
Wo@@ e to them that dev@@ ise in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and work ev@@ il upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practi@@ se it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the ro@@ be with the gar@@ ment from them that pass by sec@@ u@@ rely as men aver@@ se from war .
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleas@@ ant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my gl@@ ory for ever .
the bre@@ aker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
and I said , He@@ ar , I pra@@ y you , O heads of Jac@@ o@@ b , and ye pr@@ inces of the house of Israel ; Is it not for you to know judgment ?
who h@@ ate the good , and love the ev@@ il ; who p@@ lu@@ ck off their s@@ kin from off them , and their f@@ les@@ h from off their b@@ ones ;
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them ; and they break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry un@@ to the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have beha@@ ved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
then shall the se@@ ers be as@@ ha@@ med , and the di@@ vin@@ ers con@@ founded : ye@@ a , they shall all cover their li@@ ps ; for there is no answer of God .
but truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b his trans@@ gres@@ sion , and to Israel his sin .
hear this , I pra@@ y you , ye heads of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and pr@@ inces of the house of Israel , that ab@@ h@@ or judgment , and per@@ ver@@ t all equ@@ ity .
but they shall sit every man under his v@@ ine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the m@@ outh of the Lord of hosts hat@@ h spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his go@@ d , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
now why dost th@@ ou cry out al@@ oud ? is there no king in the@@ e ? is TH@@ Y coun@@ seller per@@ ished ? for pan@@ gs have taken the@@ e as a woman in trav@@ ail .
now gather th@@ y@@ self in troops , O daughter of troops : he hat@@ h laid siege against us : they shall sm@@ ite the judge of Israel with a ro@@ d upon the che@@ ek .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which trav@@ ail@@ eth hat@@ h brought forth : then the re@@ mn@@ ant of his bre@@ th@@ ren shall return un@@ to the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and fe@@ ed in the strength of the Lord , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into our land : and when he shall tre@@ ad in our pal@@ aces , then shall we raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight principal men .
Th@@ ine hand shall be lifted up upon th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries , and all th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall be cut off .
and I will cut off the cities of TH@@ Y land , and throw down all TH@@ Y strong holds :
and I will cut off wit@@ ch@@ craf@@ ts out of th@@ ine hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt have no more so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers :
and I will p@@ lu@@ ck up TH@@ Y gro@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e : so will I destroy TH@@ Y cities .
and I will exec@@ ute ven@@ ge@@ ance in an@@ ger and fur@@ y upon the he@@ a@@ then , such as they have not heard .
hear ye now what the Lord sa@@ ith ; arise , conten@@ d th@@ ou before the mountains , and let the hil@@ ls hear TH@@ Y voice .
for I brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt , and re@@ deemed the@@ e out of the house of servants ; and I sent before the@@ e Mos@@ es , Aaron , and Mi@@ ri@@ am .
W@@ her@@ e@@ with shall I come before the Lord , and bo@@ w myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , with cal@@ ves of a year old ?
are there yet the treasures of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and the s@@ can@@ t measure that is ab@@ omin@@ able ?
shall I count them p@@ ure with the w@@ ic@@ ked balan@@ ces , and with the bag of dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful we@@ ights ?
for the rich men there@@ of are full of violence , and the inhabitants there@@ of have spoken lies , and their ton@@ gue is dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful in their m@@ outh .
therefore also will I make the@@ e si@@ ck in s@@ mit@@ ing the@@ e , in making the@@ e de@@ so@@ late because of TH@@ Y sin@@ s .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt so@@ w , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap ; th@@ ou s@@ halt tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not ano@@ int the@@ e with oil ; and swe@@ et wine , but s@@ halt not drink wine .
the best of them is as a bri@@ er : the most u@@ pri@@ ght is shar@@ per than a Th@@ or@@ n h@@ edge : the day of TH@@ Y watch@@ men and TH@@ Y vis@@ itation co@@ me@@ th ; now shall be their per@@ p@@ lex@@ ity .
trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the doors of TH@@ Y m@@ outh from her that li@@ eth in TH@@ Y bos@@ om .
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th the father , the daughter ris@@ eth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
therefore I will look un@@ to the Lord ; I will wait for the God of my sal@@ vation : my God will hear me .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ lead my cause , and exec@@ ute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall be@@ hold his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
in the day that TH@@ Y walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the land shall be de@@ so@@ late because of them that d@@ well there@@ in , for the fruit of their do@@ ings .
according to the days of TH@@ Y coming out of the land of Egypt will I she@@ w un@@ to him mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous things .
the nations shall see and be con@@ founded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their m@@ outh , their e@@ ars shall be de@@ af .
they shall lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent , they shall move out of their ho@@ les like wor@@ ms of the ear@@ th : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of the@@ e .
he will turn again , he will have comp@@ as@@ sion upon us ; he will sub@@ due our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities ; and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
God is Je@@ al@@ ous , and the Lord reven@@ get@@ h ; the Lord reven@@ get@@ h , and is fur@@ ious ; the Lord will take ven@@ ge@@ ance on his ad@@ vers@@ aries , and he reser@@ vet@@ h wr@@ ath for his enem@@ ies .
the Lord is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will not at all acqu@@ it the w@@ ic@@ ked : the Lord hat@@ h his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
he re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h the sea , and mak@@ eth it d@@ ry , and dri@@ eth up all the rivers : B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ het@@ h , and Car@@ mel , and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ het@@ h .
the mountains quake at him , and the hil@@ ls mel@@ t , and the ear@@ th is burned at his presence , ye@@ a , the world , and all that d@@ well there@@ in .
who can stand before his in@@ dign@@ ation ? and who can abide in the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger ? his fur@@ y is p@@ oured out like fire , and the ro@@ cks are thrown down by him .
the Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he know@@ eth them that trust in him .
but with an over@@ running flood he will make an ut@@ ter end of the place there@@ of , and d@@ ark@@ ness shall pursue his enem@@ ies .
what do ye imag@@ ine against the Lord ? he will make an ut@@ ter end : aff@@ li@@ ction shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be fol@@ den together as thor@@ ns , and while they are dr@@ un@@ ken as dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds , they shall be dev@@ oured as st@@ ub@@ ble fully d@@ ry .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have aff@@ lic@@ ted the@@ e , I will aff@@ lic@@ t the@@ e no more .
for now will I break his yok@@ e from off the@@ e , and will bur@@ st TH@@ Y bonds in s@@ under .
he that d@@ ash@@ eth in pieces is come up before TH@@ Y face : keep the munition , watch the way , make TH@@ Y lo@@ ins strong , for@@ ti@@ fy TH@@ Y power m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly .
for the Lord hat@@ h turned away the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Jac@@ o@@ b , as the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Israel : for the emp@@ ti@@ ers have emp@@ tied them out , and marred their v@@ ine branches .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red , the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let : the char@@ i@@ ots shall be with f@@ laming tor@@ ches in the day of his preparation , and the f@@ ir trees shall be ter@@ ri@@ bly shaken .
the char@@ i@@ ots shall ra@@ ge in the streets , they shall j@@ ust@@ le one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like tor@@ ches , they shall run like the ligh@@ t@@ nings .
he shall re@@ count his wor@@ th@@ ies : they shall st@@ um@@ ble in their walk ; they shall make h@@ ast to the wall there@@ of , and the defence shall be prepared .
the gates of the rivers shall be opened , and the palace shall be dis@@ solved .
and H@@ uz@@ za@@ b shall be led away cap@@ tive , she shall be brought up , and her ma@@ ids shall lead her as with the voice of d@@ ov@@ es , tab@@ ering upon their bre@@ asts .
take ye the sp@@ oil of silver , take the sp@@ oil of gold : for there is none end of the store and gl@@ ory out of all the pleas@@ ant furniture .
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whel@@ ps , and st@@ ran@@ g@@ led for his li@@ on@@ esses , and filled his ho@@ les with pre@@ y , and his den@@ s with rav@@ in .
the no@@ ise of a w@@ hip , and the no@@ ise of the r@@ att@@ ling of the whe@@ els , and of the pr@@ ans@@ ing hor@@ ses , and of the jum@@ ping char@@ i@@ ots .
the Hor@@ sem@@ an lif@@ te@@ th up both the bright s@@ word and the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar : and there is a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great number of car@@ cases ; and there is none end of their cor@@ p@@ ses ; they st@@ um@@ ble upon their cor@@ p@@ ses :
be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; and I will discover TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts upon TH@@ Y face , and I will she@@ w the nations TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess , and the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms TH@@ Y sh@@ ame .
and I will cast ab@@ omin@@ able Fil@@ th upon the@@ e , and make the@@ e v@@ ile , and will set the@@ e as a gaz@@ ing@@ stock .
T@@ ho@@ u also s@@ halt be dr@@ un@@ ken : th@@ ou s@@ halt be hi@@ d , th@@ ou also s@@ halt seek strength because of the enemy .
all TH@@ Y strong holds shall be like fi@@ g trees with the fir@@ stri@@ pe fig@@ s : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the m@@ outh of the e@@ ater .
draw the@@ e waters for the siege , for@@ ti@@ fy TH@@ Y strong holds : go into cla@@ y , and tre@@ ad the mor@@ ter , make strong the bri@@ ck@@ kil@@ n .
there shall the fire dev@@ our the@@ e ; the s@@ word shall cut the@@ e off , it shall eat the@@ e up like the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m : make th@@ y@@ self many as the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m , make th@@ y@@ self many as the loc@@ ust@@ s .
TH@@ Y crow@@ ned are as the loc@@ ust@@ s , and TH@@ Y cap@@ tains as the great gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , which camp in the h@@ ed@@ ges in the cold day , but when the sun ar@@ is@@ eth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
TH@@ Y she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds s@@ lum@@ ber , O king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : TH@@ Y no@@ bles shall d@@ well in the d@@ ust : TH@@ Y people is sc@@ at@@ tered upon the mountains , and no man gather@@ eth them .
why dost th@@ ou she@@ w me in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and cause me to be@@ hold gri@@ ev@@ ance ? for sp@@ o@@ iling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up stri@@ fe and contention .
therefore the law is sla@@ cked , and judgment do@@ th never go forth : for the w@@ ic@@ ked do@@ th comp@@ ass about the righ@@ te@@ ous ; therefore wrong judgment proce@@ ede@@ th .
be@@ hold ye among the he@@ a@@ then , and regard , and wonder mar@@ v@@ el@@ lo@@ us@@ ly : for I will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
for , lo , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , which shall march through the b@@ read@@ th of the land , to poss@@ ess the d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
they are ter@@ ri@@ ble and d@@ read@@ ful : their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than the le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves : and their hor@@ se@@ men shall spread themselves , and their hor@@ se@@ men shall come from far ; they shall fly as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to eat .
they shall come all for violence : their faces shall su@@ p up as the east wind , and they shall gather the cap@@ tivity as the s@@ and .
and they shall sco@@ ff at the kings , and the pr@@ inces shall be a scor@@ n un@@ to them : they shall der@@ ide every strong hold ; for they shall he@@ ap d@@ ust , and take it .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and off@@ end , imp@@ ut@@ ing this his power un@@ to his go@@ d .
and mak@@ est men as the fis@@ hes of the sea , as the cre@@ eping things , that have no ru@@ ler over them ?
they take up all of them with the an@@ gle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their dra@@ g : therefore they re@@ jo@@ ice and are glad .
therefore they sacrifice un@@ to their net , and bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to their dra@@ g ; because by them their portion is f@@ at , and their meat plen@@ te@@ ous .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the to@@ wer , and will watch to see what he will say un@@ to me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
and the Lord answ@@ ered me , and said , W@@ r@@ ite the vision , and make it pla@@ in upon tables , that he may run that re@@ ade@@ th it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
be@@ hold , his sou@@ l which is lifted up is not u@@ pri@@ ght in him : but the just shall live by his faith .
shall they not rise up su@@ d@@ den@@ ly that shall bi@@ te the@@ e , and aw@@ ake that shall ve@@ x the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be for bo@@ o@@ ties un@@ to them ?
Wo@@ e to him that c@@ ov@@ ete@@ th an ev@@ il c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness to his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the power of ev@@ il !
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast consul@@ ted sh@@ ame to TH@@ Y house by cutting off many people , and h@@ ast sin@@ ned against TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the be@@ am out of the tim@@ ber shall answer it .
Wo@@ e to him that buil@@ de@@ th a town with blood , and st@@ ab@@ lis@@ het@@ h a city by in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity !
be@@ hold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall we@@ ary themselves for very van@@ ity ?
for the ear@@ th shall be filled with the knowledge of the gl@@ ory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
Wo@@ e un@@ to him that gi@@ vet@@ h his neighbour drink , that p@@ ut@@ test TH@@ Y bot@@ tle to him , and mak@@ est him dr@@ un@@ ken also , that th@@ ou may@@ est look on their nak@@ edn@@ ess !
God came from Tem@@ an , and the Holy One from mount Par@@ an . Se@@ lah . his gl@@ ory covered the heav@@ ens , and the ear@@ th was full of his praise .
and his bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was as the light ; he had hor@@ ns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
I saw the ten@@ ts of C@@ us@@ han in aff@@ li@@ ction : and the cur@@ tains of the land of Mi@@ dian did tre@@ m@@ ble .
was the Lord disp@@ le@@ ased against the rivers ? was th@@ ine an@@ ger against the rivers ? was TH@@ Y wr@@ ath against the sea , that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ride upon th@@ ine hor@@ ses and TH@@ Y char@@ i@@ ots of sal@@ vation ?
TH@@ Y bo@@ w was made quite nak@@ ed , according to the o@@ aths of the tri@@ bes , even TH@@ Y word . Se@@ lah . T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st cle@@ ave the ear@@ th with rivers .
the mountains saw the@@ e , and they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led : the over@@ flow@@ ing of the water passed by : the deep ut@@ tered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in their habi@@ tation : at the light of th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws they went , and at the sh@@ ining of TH@@ Y g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st march through the land in in@@ dign@@ ation , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st th@@ res@@ h the he@@ a@@ then in an@@ ger .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ en@@ test forth for the sal@@ vation of TH@@ Y people , even for sal@@ vation with th@@ ine ano@@ in@@ ted ; th@@ ou wo@@ un@@ de@@ d@@ st the head out of the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked , by dis@@ covering the foundation un@@ to the nec@@ k . Se@@ lah .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st strike through with his st@@ aves the head of his villages : they came out as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ at@@ ter me : their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing was as to dev@@ our the poor secre@@ tly .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st walk through the sea with th@@ ine hor@@ ses , through the he@@ ap of great waters .
yet I will re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord , I will joy in the God of my sal@@ vation .
I will ut@@ ter@@ ly consum@@ e all things from off the land , sa@@ ith the Lord .
hold TH@@ Y peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hat@@ h prepared a sacrifice , he hat@@ h bid his guests .
in the same day also will I punish all those that le@@ ap on the threshold , which fill their mas@@ ters ' houses with violence and dec@@ e@@ it .
therefore their goods shall become a bo@@ o@@ ty , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall also build houses , but not in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but not drink the wine there@@ of .
the great day of the Lord is near , it is near , and has@@ te@@ th greatly , even the voice of the day of the Lord : the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall cry there bit@@ ter@@ ly .
that day is a day of wr@@ ath , a day of trouble and dist@@ ress , a day of was@@ ten@@ ess and de@@ so@@ lation , a day of d@@ ark@@ ness and glo@@ omin@@ ess , a day of cl@@ ou@@ ds and th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness ,
seek ye the Lord , all ye me@@ ek of the ear@@ th , which have w@@ rought his judgment ; seek righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , seek me@@ ek@@ ness : it may be ye shall be hi@@ d in the day of the Lord 's an@@ ger .
for Gaza shall be for@@ sak@@ en , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall drive out Ash@@ do@@ d at the noon day , and E@@ kr@@ on shall be rooted up .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have re@@ pro@@ ached and mag@@ ni@@ fied themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts .
the Lord will be ter@@ ri@@ ble un@@ to them : for he will fam@@ ish all the go@@ ds of the ear@@ th ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the is@@ les of the he@@ a@@ then .
and he will stretch out his hand against the north , and destroy As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and will make N@@ inev@@ e@@ h a de@@ so@@ lation , and d@@ ry like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
she obe@@ yed not the voice ; she received not correc@@ tion ; she tr@@ usted not in the Lord ; she drew not near to her God .
her pr@@ inces within her are ro@@ aring li@@ ons ; her judges are evening w@@ ol@@ ves ; they gn@@ a@@ w not the b@@ ones ti@@ ll the mor@@ row .
her pro@@ ph@@ ets are light and t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous persons : her pri@@ ests have pollu@@ ted the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , they have done violence to the law .
for then will I turn to the people a p@@ ure language , that they may all call upon the name of the Lord , to serve him with one consent .
from beyond the rivers of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia my supp@@ li@@ ants , even the daughter of my disper@@ sed , shall bring mine offering .
I will also leave in the mid@@ st of the@@ e an aff@@ lic@@ ted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel shall not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh : for they shall fe@@ ed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
in that day it shall be said to Jer@@ usalem , Fe@@ ar th@@ ou not : and to Z@@ ion , Let not th@@ ine hands be S@@ lack .
the Lord TH@@ Y God in the mid@@ st of the@@ e is m@@ igh@@ ty ; he will save , he will re@@ jo@@ ice over the@@ e with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over the@@ e with singing .
therefore the heav@@ en over you is stayed from dew , and the ear@@ th is stayed from her fruit .
in the seventh month , in the one and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t Hag@@ ga@@ i , saying ,
speak now to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , and to the resi@@ due of the people , saying ,
who is left among you that saw this house in her first gl@@ ory ? and how do ye see it now ? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing ?
according to the word that I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so my spirit remain@@ eth among you : fear ye not .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Y@@ et once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heav@@ ens , and the ear@@ th , and the sea , and the d@@ ry land ;
and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with gl@@ ory , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
I smo@@ te you with b@@ lasting and with mil@@ dew and with ha@@ il in all the la@@ bour@@ s of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
consider now from this day and up@@ ward , from the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temp@@ le was laid , consider it .
and again the word of the Lord came un@@ to Hag@@ ga@@ i in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , saying ,
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
therefore say th@@ ou un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Tur@@ n ye un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , and I will turn un@@ to you , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
your fa@@ thers , where are they ? and the pro@@ ph@@ ets , do they live for ever ?
and the man that stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees answ@@ ered and said , These are they whom the Lord hat@@ h sent to walk to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th .
and they answ@@ ered the an@@ gel of the Lord that stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , We have walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th , and , be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th sit@@ te@@ th still , and is at rest .
and the Lord answ@@ ered the an@@ gel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words .
and I am very sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with the he@@ a@@ then that are at ease : for I was but a little disp@@ le@@ ased , and they helped forward the aff@@ li@@ ction .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold four hor@@ ns .
I lifted up mine eyes again , and looked , and be@@ hold a man with a measuring line in his hand .
and , be@@ hold , the an@@ gel that talked with me went forth , and another an@@ gel went out to meet him ,
for I , sa@@ ith the Lord , will be un@@ to her a wall of fire round about , and will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
H@@ o , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , sa@@ ith the Lord : for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heav@@ en , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; After the gl@@ ory hat@@ h he sent me un@@ to the nations which sp@@ o@@ iled you : for he that tou@@ ch@@ eth you tou@@ ch@@ eth the app@@ le of his eye .
sing and re@@ jo@@ ice , O daughter of Z@@ ion : for , lo , I come , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sent me un@@ to the@@ e .
be silent , O all f@@ les@@ h , before the Lord : for he is raised up out of his hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
and he she@@ wed me Jos@@ hua the high pri@@ est standing before the an@@ gel of the Lord , and S@@ atan standing at his right hand to res@@ ist him .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord protested un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
hear now , O Jos@@ hua the high pri@@ est , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y fel@@ lows that sit before the@@ e : for they are men won@@ dered at : for , be@@ hold , I will bring forth my ser@@ vant the branch .
and the an@@ gel that talked with me came again , and w@@ aked me , as a man that is w@@ ak@@ ened out of his sle@@ ep ,
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bo@@ w@@ l , and the other upon the left side there@@ of .
the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
then answ@@ ered I , and said un@@ to him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the cand@@ le@@ stick and upon the left side there@@ of ?
and I answ@@ ered again , and said un@@ to him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pip@@ es empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
then I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold a flying rol@@ l .
and , be@@ hold , there was lifted up a tal@@ ent of lead : and this is a woman that sit@@ te@@ th in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h .
and he said , This is w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . and he cast it into the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the m@@ outh there@@ of .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came four char@@ i@@ ots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of br@@ ass .
in the first char@@ i@@ ot were red hor@@ ses ; and in the second char@@ i@@ ot black hor@@ ses ;
and in the third char@@ i@@ ot white hor@@ ses ; and in the fourth char@@ i@@ ot gr@@ is@@ led and bay hor@@ ses .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ered and said un@@ to me , These are the four spir@@ its of the heav@@ ens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the ear@@ th .
the black hor@@ ses which are there@@ in go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the gr@@ is@@ led go forth toward the south country .
then cri@@ ed he upon me , and sp@@ ake un@@ to me , saying , be@@ hold , these that go toward the north country have qu@@ i@@ eted my spirit in the north country .
and the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , which are come from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and come th@@ ou the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
then take silver and gold , and make crow@@ ns , and set them upon the head of Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est ;
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Dar@@ i@@ us , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u ;
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and drink for yo@@ ur@@ selves ?
and op@@ press not the wi@@ dow , nor the fa@@ ther@@ less , the st@@ ran@@ ger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imag@@ ine ev@@ il against his brother in your heart .
but they refused to he@@ arken , and pulled away the sho@@ ul@@ der , and stopped their e@@ ars , that they should not hear .
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cri@@ ed , and they would not hear ; so they cri@@ ed , and I would not hear , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts :
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fa@@ thers provoked me to wr@@ ath , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , and I re@@ pen@@ ted not :
so again have I thought in these days to do well un@@ to Jer@@ usalem and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Spe@@ ak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and let none of you imag@@ ine ev@@ il in your hear@@ ts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that I h@@ ate , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; It shall yet come to pass , that there shall come people , and the inhabitants of many cities :
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go spe@@ edil@@ y to pra@@ y before the Lord , and to seek the Lord of hosts : I will go also .
Ye@@ a , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jer@@ usalem , and to pra@@ y before the Lord .
and T@@ y@@ ru@@ s did build her@@ self a strong hold , and he@@ ap@@ ed up silver as the d@@ ust , and fine gold as the m@@ ire of the streets .
be@@ hold , the Lord will cast her out , and he will sm@@ ite her power in the sea ; and she shall be dev@@ oured with fire .
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and E@@ kr@@ on ; for her expec@@ tation shall be as@@ ha@@ med ; and the king shall per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and a Bas@@ tar@@ d shall d@@ well in Ash@@ do@@ d , and I will cut off the pride of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
as for the@@ e also , by the blood of TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant I have sent forth TH@@ Y prisoners out of the p@@ it where@@ in is no water .
turn you to the strong hold , ye prisoners of hope : even to day do I declare that I will ren@@ der double un@@ to the@@ e ;
and the Lord shall be seen over them , and his ar@@ row shall go forth as the ligh@@ t@@ ning : and the Lord God shall blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and shall go with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a cro@@ wn , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
for how great is his Go@@ od@@ ness , and how great is his beauty ! cor@@ n shall make the young men che@@ er@@ ful , and new wine the ma@@ ids .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright cl@@ ou@@ ds , and give them sho@@ wers of rain , to every one gr@@ ass in the field .
out of him came forth the cor@@ ner , out of him the na@@ il , out of him the battle bo@@ w , out of him every op@@ pres@@ sor together .
and they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , which tre@@ ad down their enem@@ ies in the m@@ ire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses shall be con@@ founded .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord .
I will his@@ s for them , and gather them ; for I have re@@ deemed them : and they shall increase as they have increased .
and I will so@@ w them among the people : and they shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children , and turn again .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and L@@ aban@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and I will strengthen them in the Lord ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , sa@@ ith the Lord .
there is a voice of the ho@@ w@@ ling of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ; for their gl@@ ory is sp@@ o@@ iled : a voice of the ro@@ aring of young li@@ ons ; for the pride of Jordan is sp@@ o@@ iled .
three she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds also I cut off in one month ; and my sou@@ l lo@@ th@@ ed them , and their sou@@ l also ab@@ hor@@ red me .
and I took my staff , even Be@@ auty , and cut it ass@@ under , that I might break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I had made with all the people .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that w@@ aited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord .
and I said un@@ to them , If ye think good , give me my price ; and if not , for@@ bear . so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver .
the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord , which stret@@ ch@@ eth forth the heav@@ ens , and lay@@ eth the foundation of the ear@@ th , and for@@ me@@ th the spirit of man within him .
be@@ hold , I will make Jer@@ usalem a c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling un@@ to all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Ju@@ da@@ h and against Jer@@ usalem .
and the govern@@ ors of Ju@@ da@@ h shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts their God .
the Lord also shall save the ten@@ ts of Ju@@ da@@ h first , that the gl@@ ory of the house of David and the gl@@ ory of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem do not mag@@ ni@@ fy themselves against Ju@@ da@@ h .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jer@@ usalem .
in that day there shall be a fo@@ un@@ tain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem for sin and for un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall be as@@ ha@@ med every one of his vision , when he hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied ; neither shall they wear a roug@@ h gar@@ ment to dec@@ e@@ ive :
but he shall say , I am no pro@@ phe@@ t , I am an hus@@ b@@ and@@ man ; for man ta@@ ught me to keep c@@ attle from my youth .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , sa@@ ith the Lord , two parts there@@ in shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left there@@ in .
then shall the Lord go forth , and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the light shall not be clear , nor dark :
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord , not day , nor night : but it shall come to pass , that at evening time it shall be light .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hin@@ der sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and the Lord shall be king over all the ear@@ th : in that day shall there be one Lord , and his name one .
and men shall d@@ well in it , and there shall be no more ut@@ ter destruction ; but Jer@@ usalem shall be saf@@ ely inhabited .
and Ju@@ da@@ h also shall fight at Jer@@ usalem ; and the wealth of all the he@@ a@@ then round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and appar@@ el , in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
and so shall be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the ass , and of all the be@@ asts that shall be in these ten@@ ts , as this pla@@ gue .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
in that day shall there be upon the bel@@ ls of the hor@@ ses , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS un@@ to the Lord ; and the po@@ ts in the Lord 's house shall be like the bo@@ w@@ l 's before the alt@@ ar .
the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Mal@@ ach@@ i .
and now , I pra@@ y you , bes@@ e@@ ech God that he will be gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to us : this hat@@ h been by your means : will he regard your persons ? sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
but ye have prof@@ an@@ ed it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is pollu@@ ted ; and the fruit there@@ of , even his meat , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble .
be@@ hold , I will corrupt your se@@ ed , and spread D@@ ung upon your faces , even the D@@ ung of your so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts ; and one shall take you away with it .
and ye shall know that I have sent this comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to you , that my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant might be with L@@ evi , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him for the fear where@@ with he fear@@ ed me , and was afraid before my name .
for the pri@@ est 's li@@ ps should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his m@@ outh : for he is the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the Lord of hosts .
but ye are depar@@ ted out of the way ; ye have caused many to st@@ um@@ ble at the law ; ye have cor@@ rupted the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of L@@ evi , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
have we not all one father ? hat@@ h not one God created us ? why do we deal t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously every man against his brother , by prof@@ an@@ ing the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of our fa@@ thers ?
Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and an ab@@ omin@@ ation is committed in Israel and in Jer@@ usalem ; for Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of the Lord which he lov@@ ed , and hat@@ h married the daughter of a st@@ range go@@ d .
the Lord will cut off the man that do@@ eth this , the master and the scho@@ lar , out of the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of Jac@@ o@@ b , and him that offer@@ eth an offering un@@ to the Lord of hosts .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appe@@ aret@@ h ? for he is like a refin@@ er 's fire , and like ful@@ lers ' so@@ ap :
then shall the offering of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem be pleas@@ ant un@@ to the Lord , as in the days of old , and as in former years .
Y@@ e are Cur@@ sed with a cur@@ se : for ye have ro@@ bbed me , even this whole nation .
and I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast her fruit before the time in the field , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and now we call the proud happy ; ye@@ a , they that work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess are set up ; ye@@ a , they that temp@@ t God are even delivered .
then they that fear@@ ed the Lord sp@@ ake often one to another : and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed , and heard it , and a book of re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance was written before him for them that fear@@ ed the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
but un@@ to you that fear my name shall the S@@ un of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness arise with he@@ aling in his w@@ ings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as cal@@ ves of the stall .
and ye shall tre@@ ad down the w@@ ic@@ ked ; for they shall be ashes under the so@@ les of your feet in the day that I shall do this , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fa@@ thers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fa@@ thers , lest I come and sm@@ ite the ear@@ th with a cur@@ se .
and J@@ es@@ se beg@@ at David the king ; and David the king beg@@ at Solomon of her that had been the wife of U@@ ri@@ as ;
and Jos@@ ias beg@@ at J@@ ech@@ on@@ ias and his bre@@ th@@ ren , about the time they were carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
and Jac@@ o@@ b beg@@ at Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born J@@ es@@ us , who is called Ch@@ r@@ ist .
so all the generations from Ab@@ ra@@ ham to David are fo@@ ur@@ teen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Bab@@ yl@@ on are fo@@ ur@@ teen generations ; and from the carrying away into Bab@@ yl@@ on un@@ to Ch@@ r@@ ist are fo@@ ur@@ teen generations .
now the birth of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was es@@ po@@ used to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy gh@@ ost .
then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a public@@ k example , was min@@ ded to put her away priv@@ ily .
and she shall bring forth a son , and th@@ ou s@@ halt call his name J@@ es@@ us : for he shall save his people from their sin@@ s .
now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
be@@ hold , a vir@@ gin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Em@@ man@@ uel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
then Joseph being raised from sle@@ ep did as the an@@ gel of the Lord had bid@@ den him , and took un@@ to him his wife :
and knew her not ti@@ ll she had brought forth her fir@@ st@@ born son : and he called his name J@@ es@@ us .
when Her@@ od the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jer@@ usalem with him .
and when he had gathered all the chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes of the people together , he demanded of them where Ch@@ r@@ ist should be born .
and th@@ ou B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , in the land of J@@ uda , art not the least among the pr@@ inces of J@@ uda : for out of the@@ e shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
then Her@@ od , when he had priv@@ ily called the wise men , inqu@@ ired of them dil@@ ig@@ ently what time the star appeared .
and he sent them to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said , G@@ o and search dil@@ ig@@ ently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they depar@@ ted ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , ti@@ ll it came and stood over where the young child was .
when they saw the star , they re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with exceeding great joy .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Her@@ od , they depar@@ ted into their own country another way .
when he ar@@ ose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and depar@@ ted into Egypt :
and was there until the death of Her@@ od : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , O@@ ut of Egypt have I called my son .
in Rama was there a voice heard , lament@@ ation , and we@@ eping , and great mourning , R@@ ach@@ el we@@ eping for her children , and would not be comfor@@ ted , because they are not .
and he ar@@ ose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus did reign in Ju@@ da@@ ea in the room of his father Her@@ od , he was afraid to go th@@ ither : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Gal@@ il@@ ee :
in those days came John the B@@ ap@@ tist , pre@@ aching in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ ea ,
and the same John had his ra@@ im@@ ent of C@@ ame@@ l 's ha@@ ir , and a le@@ a@@ thern gir@@ dle about his lo@@ ins ; and his meat was loc@@ ust@@ s and wild hon@@ ey .
and think not to say within yo@@ ur@@ selves , We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham to our father : for I say un@@ to you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze you with water un@@ to rep@@ ent@@ ance : but he that co@@ me@@ th after me is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than I , whose sho@@ es I am not wor@@ thy to bear : he shall b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze you with the Holy gh@@ ost , and with fire :
and when he had fas@@ ted for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , he was after@@ ward an hun@@ g@@ red .
and when the temp@@ ter came to him , he said , If th@@ ou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
again , the dev@@ il tak@@ eth him up into an exceeding high mountain , and she@@ w@@ eth him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , and the gl@@ ory of them ;
and sa@@ ith un@@ to him , All these things will I give the@@ e , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t fall down and worship me .
now when J@@ es@@ us had heard that John was cast into prison , he depar@@ ted into Gal@@ il@@ ee ;
and leaving N@@ azar@@ eth , he came and d@@ wel@@ t in Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Z@@ ab@@ ul@@ on and N@@ ep@@ h@@ thal@@ im :
the people which sat in d@@ ark@@ ness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sp@@ run@@ g up .
and J@@ es@@ us , walk@@ ing by the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , saw two bre@@ th@@ ren , Simon called Peter , and An@@ drew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fis@@ hers .
and seeing the multi@@ tu@@ des , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his dis@@ cip@@ les came un@@ to him :
b@@ les@@ sed are they which do hunger and thir@@ st after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for they shall be filled .
b@@ les@@ sed are they which are persec@@ uted for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ' sake : for the@@ ir@@ s is the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
b@@ les@@ sed are ye , when men shall rev@@ ile you , and persec@@ ute you , and shall say all manner of ev@@ il against you fal@@ sely , for my sake .
re@@ jo@@ ice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heav@@ en : for so persec@@ uted they the pro@@ ph@@ ets which were before you .
Y@@ e are the light of the world . a city that is set on an hill can@@ not be hi@@ d .
neither do men light a cand@@ le , and put it under a b@@ ush@@ el , but on a cand@@ le@@ stick ; and it gi@@ vet@@ h light un@@ to all that are in the house .
let your light so sh@@ ine before men , that they may see your good works , and g@@ lor@@ ify your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
for I say un@@ to you , That except your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall exceed the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , ye shall in no case enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
Y@@ e have heard that it was said by them of old time , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not kill ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
agree with th@@ ine ad@@ versary quickly , wh@@ il@@ es th@@ ou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the ad@@ versary deliver the@@ e to the judge , and the judge deliver the@@ e to the officer , and th@@ ou be cast into prison .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt by no means come out th@@ ence , ti@@ ll th@@ ou h@@ ast paid the ut@@ ter@@ most far@@ thing .
but I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever lo@@ ok@@ eth on a woman to l@@ ust after her hat@@ h committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with her already in his heart .
and if TH@@ Y right hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut if off , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
it hat@@ h been said , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of div@@ or@@ cement :
but I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of for@@ nic@@ ation , ca@@ us@@ eth her to commit ad@@ ul@@ tery : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall mar@@ ry her that is div@@ or@@ ced commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery .
again , ye have heard that it hat@@ h been said by them of old time , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not for@@ swe@@ ar th@@ y@@ self , but s@@ halt perform un@@ to the Lord th@@ ine o@@ aths :
Y@@ e have heard that it hat@@ h been said , A@@ n eye for an eye , and a to@@ o@@ th for a to@@ o@@ th :
but I say un@@ to you , That ye res@@ ist not ev@@ il : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall sm@@ ite the@@ e on TH@@ Y right che@@ ek , turn to him the other also .
and if any man will sue the@@ e at the law , and take away TH@@ Y co@@ at , let him have TH@@ Y clo@@ ke also .
give to him that ask@@ eth the@@ e , and from him that would bor@@ row of the@@ e turn not th@@ ou away .
Y@@ e have heard that it hat@@ h been said , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt love TH@@ Y neighbour , and h@@ ate th@@ ine enemy .
but I say un@@ to you , Lo@@ ve your enem@@ ies , b@@ less them that cur@@ se you , do good to them that h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for them which desp@@ ite@@ fully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
that ye may be the children of your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en : for he mak@@ eth his sun to rise on the ev@@ il and on the good , and sen@@ de@@ th rain on the just and on the un@@ just .
and if ye sal@@ ute your bre@@ th@@ ren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the public@@ ans so ?
take heed that ye do not your al@@ ms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
but th@@ ou , when th@@ ou pray@@ est , enter into TH@@ Y clos@@ et , and when th@@ ou h@@ ast shut TH@@ Y door , pra@@ y to TH@@ Y F@@ ather which is in secret ; and TH@@ Y F@@ ather which se@@ eth in secret shall reward the@@ e openly .
but when ye pra@@ y , use not v@@ ain re@@ peti@@ tions , as the he@@ a@@ then do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
be not ye therefore like un@@ to them : for your F@@ ather know@@ eth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
and lead us not into temp@@ tation , but deliver us from ev@@ il : for th@@ ine is the k@@ ing@@ dom , and the power , and the gl@@ ory , for ever . A@@ men .
that th@@ ou appear not un@@ to men to fast , but un@@ to TH@@ Y F@@ ather which is in secret : and TH@@ Y F@@ ather , which se@@ eth in secret , shall reward the@@ e openly .
the light of the body is the eye : if therefore th@@ ine eye be single , TH@@ Y whole body shall be full of light .
but if th@@ ine eye be ev@@ il , TH@@ Y whole body shall be full of d@@ ark@@ ness . if therefore the light that is in the@@ e be d@@ ark@@ ness , how great is that d@@ ark@@ ness !
which of you by taking thought can add one cu@@ bit un@@ to his stat@@ ure ?
and why take ye thought for ra@@ im@@ ent ? consider the l@@ ilies of the field , how they grow ; they to@@ il not , neither do they sp@@ in :
and yet I say un@@ to you , That even Solomon in all his gl@@ ory was not ar@@ ray@@ ed like one of these .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , if God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass of the field , which to day is , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en , shall he not much more clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
( for after all these things do the Gen@@ ti@@ les seek : ) for your heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather know@@ eth that ye have need of all these things .
but seek ye first the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; and all these things shall be added un@@ to you .
take therefore no thought for the mor@@ row : for the mor@@ row shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient un@@ to the day is the ev@@ il there@@ of .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be jud@@ ged : and with what measure ye M@@ ete , it shall be meas@@ ured to you again .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but consider@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
or how w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou say to TH@@ Y brother , Let me pull out the mote out of th@@ ine eye ; and , be@@ hold , a be@@ am is in th@@ ine own eye ?
T@@ ho@@ u hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite , first cast out the be@@ am out of th@@ ine own eye ; and then s@@ halt th@@ ou see clearly to cast out the mote out of TH@@ Y brother 's eye .
give not that which is hol@@ y un@@ to the do@@ gs , neither cast ye your pe@@ ar@@ ls before sw@@ ine , lest they tr@@ amp@@ le them under their feet , and turn again and ren@@ d you .
ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; kno@@ ck , and it shall be opened un@@ to you :
for every one that ask@@ eth recei@@ vet@@ h ; and he that seek@@ eth fin@@ de@@ th ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
or if he ask a fish , will he give him a ser@@ p@@ ent ?
if ye then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts un@@ to your children , how much more shall your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en give good things to them that ask him ?
enter ye in at the stra@@ it gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that le@@ ade@@ th to destruction , and many there be which go in there@@ at :
because stra@@ it is the gate , and narrow is the way , which le@@ ade@@ th un@@ to life , and few there be that find it .
Y@@ e shall know them by their fru@@ its . do men gather grap@@ es of thor@@ ns , or fig@@ s of th@@ ist@@ les ?
a good tree can@@ not bring forth ev@@ il fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
every tree that br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
not every one that sa@@ ith un@@ to me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en ; but he that do@@ eth the will of my F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
therefore wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them , I will lik@@ en him un@@ to a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and the rain des@@ cen@@ ded , and the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
and every one that he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened un@@ to a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , which built his house upon the s@@ and :
and the rain des@@ cen@@ ded , and the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
and it came to pass , when J@@ es@@ us had ended these say@@ ings , the people were ast@@ on@@ ished at his doc@@ tr@@ ine :
and when J@@ es@@ us was entered into Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , there came un@@ to him a centur@@ ion , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing him ,
the centur@@ ion answ@@ ered and said , Lord , I am not wor@@ thy that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest come under my ro@@ of : but speak the word only , and my ser@@ vant shall be he@@ aled .
and I say un@@ to you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b , in the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to the centur@@ ion , G@@ o TH@@ Y way ; and as th@@ ou h@@ ast believed , so be it done un@@ to the@@ e . and his ser@@ vant was he@@ aled in the sel@@ f@@ same hour .
and when J@@ es@@ us was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and si@@ ck of a f@@ ever .
and he touched her hand , and the f@@ ever left her : and she ar@@ ose , and minist@@ ered un@@ to them .
when the even was come , they brought un@@ to him many that were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils : and he cast out the spir@@ its with his word , and he@@ aled all that were si@@ ck :
now when J@@ es@@ us saw great multi@@ tu@@ des about him , he gave comman@@ d@@ ment to de@@ part un@@ to the other side .
and J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to him , The fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les , and the birds of the air have nes@@ ts ; but the Son of man hat@@ h not where to lay his head .
but J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to him , Fol@@ low me ; and let the dead bur@@ y their dead .
and , be@@ hold , there ar@@ ose a great temp@@ est in the sea , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was as@@ le@@ ep .
and he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Wh@@ y are ye fear@@ ful , O ye of little faith ? then he ar@@ ose , and re@@ bu@@ ked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
so the dev@@ ils bes@@ ought him , saying , If th@@ ou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the her@@ d of sw@@ ine .
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was be@@ fallen to the poss@@ essed of the dev@@ ils .
and , be@@ hold , the whole city came out to meet J@@ es@@ us : and when they saw him , they bes@@ ought him that he would de@@ part out of their co@@ asts .
and he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
but that ye may know that the Son of man hat@@ h power on ear@@ th to for@@ give sin@@ s , ( then sa@@ ith he to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , ) arise , take up TH@@ Y bed , and go un@@ to th@@ ine house .
but when the multi@@ tu@@ des saw it , they mar@@ v@@ elled , and gl@@ ori@@ fied God , which had given such power un@@ to men .
and it came to pass , as J@@ es@@ us sat at meat in the house , be@@ hold , many public@@ ans and sin@@ ners came and sat down with him and his dis@@ cip@@ les .
but when J@@ es@@ us heard that , he said un@@ to them , They that be whole need not a physi@@ cian , but they that are si@@ ck .
but go ye and learn what that mean@@ eth , I will have mer@@ cy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righ@@ te@@ ous , but sin@@ ners to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
no man p@@ ut@@ te@@ th a piece of new clo@@ th un@@ to an old gar@@ ment , for that which is put in to fill it up tak@@ eth from the gar@@ ment , and the rent is made worse .
and J@@ es@@ us ar@@ ose , and followed him , and so did his dis@@ cip@@ les .
and , be@@ hold , a woman , which was dis@@ eased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his gar@@ ment :
but J@@ es@@ us turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Da@@ ughter , be of good comfor@@ t ; TH@@ Y faith hat@@ h made the@@ e whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
but when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the ma@@ id ar@@ ose .
but they , when they were depar@@ ted , spread abroad his f@@ ame in all that country .
as they went out , be@@ hold , they brought to him a dum@@ b man poss@@ essed with a dev@@ il .
and when the dev@@ il was cast out , the dum@@ b sp@@ ake : and the multi@@ tu@@ des mar@@ v@@ elled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
and J@@ es@@ us went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their syn@@ ago@@ gues , and pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and he@@ aling every si@@ ck@@ ness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they fa@@ in@@ ted , and were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad , as she@@ ep having no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and when he had called un@@ to him his twelve dis@@ cip@@ les , he gave them power against un@@ clean spir@@ its , to cast them out , and to he@@ al all manner of si@@ ck@@ ness and all manner of disease .
and as ye go , pre@@ ach , saying , The k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is at hand .
and into wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever city or town ye shall enter , inqu@@ ire who in it is wor@@ thy ; and there abide ti@@ ll ye go th@@ ence .
and if the house be wor@@ thy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not wor@@ thy , let your peace return to you .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye de@@ part out of that house or city , shake off the d@@ ust of your feet .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for the land of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
be@@ hold , I send you forth as she@@ ep in the mid@@ st of w@@ ol@@ ves : be ye therefore wise as Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and harm@@ less as d@@ ov@@ es .
but be@@ w@@ are of men : for they will deliver you up to the coun@@ cils , and they will s@@ cour@@ ge you in their syn@@ ago@@ gues ;
and ye shall be brought before govern@@ ors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
for it is not ye that speak , but the Spiri@@ t of your F@@ ather which speak@@ eth in you .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all men for my name 's sake : but he that en@@ du@@ re@@ th to the end shall be sav@@ ed .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , ti@@ ll the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be as his master , and the ser@@ vant as his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
what I tell you in d@@ ark@@ ness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the e@@ ar , that pre@@ ach ye upon the hous@@ et@@ ops .
think not that I am come to send peace on ear@@ th : I came not to send peace , but a s@@ word .
for I am come to set a man at vari@@ ance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
he that lov@@ eth father or mother more than me is not wor@@ thy of me : and he that lov@@ eth son or daughter more than me is not wor@@ thy of me .
and he that tak@@ eth not his cross , and follow@@ eth after me , is not wor@@ thy of me .
he that fin@@ de@@ th his life shall lose it : and he that los@@ eth his life for my sake shall find it .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give to drink un@@ to one of these little ones a c@@ up of cold water only in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
and it came to pass , when J@@ es@@ us had made an end of comman@@ ding his twelve dis@@ cip@@ les , he depar@@ ted th@@ ence to te@@ ach and to pre@@ ach in their cities .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , G@@ o and she@@ w John again those things which ye do hear and see :
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , and the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , and the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached to them .
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clo@@ th@@ ed in soft ra@@ im@@ ent ? be@@ hold , they that wear soft clo@@ thing are in kings ' houses .
for this is he , of whom it is written , be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before TH@@ Y face , which shall prepare TH@@ Y way before the@@ e .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , A@@ mon@@ g them that are born of women there hat@@ h not risen a greater than John the B@@ ap@@ tist : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing he that is least in the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is greater than he .
and from the days of John the B@@ ap@@ tist until now the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en suffer@@ eth violence , and the violent take it by force .
he that hat@@ h e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
but I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on at the day of judgment , than for you .
but I say un@@ to you , That it shall be more toler@@ able for the land of So@@ dom in the day of judgment , than for the@@ e .
even so , F@@ ather : for so it seemed good in TH@@ Y sight .
all things are delivered un@@ to me of my F@@ ather : and no man know@@ eth the Son , but the F@@ ather ; neither know@@ eth any man the F@@ ather , save the Son , and he to wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever the Son will reveal him .
take my yok@@ e upon you , and learn of me ; for I am me@@ ek and low@@ ly in heart : and ye shall find rest un@@ to your so@@ ul@@ s .
at that time J@@ es@@ us went on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day through the cor@@ n ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les were an hun@@ g@@ red , and began to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n , and to eat .
but when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees saw it , they said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y dis@@ cip@@ les do that which is not law@@ ful to do upon the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
but he said un@@ to them , H@@ ave ye not read what David did , when he was an hun@@ g@@ red , and they that were with him ;
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days the pri@@ ests in the temp@@ le prof@@ ane the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and are bla@@ me@@ less ?
but if ye had known what this mean@@ eth , I will have mer@@ cy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guil@@ t@@ less .
and when he was depar@@ ted th@@ ence , he went into their syn@@ ago@@ gue :
and , be@@ hold , there was a man which had his hand with@@ ered . and they asked him , saying , Is it law@@ ful to he@@ al on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days ? that they might accuse him .
then sa@@ ith he to the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stret@@ ched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
then the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
but when J@@ es@@ us knew it , he withdrew himself from th@@ ence : and great multi@@ tu@@ des followed him , and he he@@ aled them all ;
he shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
a bru@@ ised Re@@ ed shall he not break , and smoking fla@@ x shall he not qu@@ en@@ ch , ti@@ ll he send forth judgment un@@ to victory .
then was brought un@@ to him one poss@@ essed with a dev@@ il , b@@ lin@@ d , and dum@@ b : and he he@@ aled him , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that the b@@ lin@@ d and dum@@ b both sp@@ ake and saw .
but when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees heard it , they said , This fellow do@@ th not cast out dev@@ ils , but by Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b the pr@@ ince of the dev@@ ils .
and J@@ es@@ us knew their th@@ ou@@ ghts , and said un@@ to them , Every k@@ ing@@ dom divided against itself is brought to de@@ so@@ lation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
but if I cast out dev@@ ils by the Spiri@@ t of God , then the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is come un@@ to you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he first bin@@ d the strong man ? and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gather@@ eth not with me sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth abroad .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I say un@@ to you , All manner of sin and b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y shall be for@@ given un@@ to men : but the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y against the Holy gh@@ ost shall not be for@@ given un@@ to men .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth against the Holy gh@@ ost , it shall not be for@@ given him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
O generation of vi@@ pers , how can ye , being ev@@ il , speak good things ? for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart the m@@ outh speak@@ eth .
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth good things : and an ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure br@@ ing@@ eth forth ev@@ il things .
but I say un@@ to you , That every id@@ le word that men shall speak , they shall give account there@@ of in the day of judgment .
for by TH@@ Y words th@@ ou s@@ halt be justified , and by TH@@ Y words th@@ ou s@@ halt be condemned .
the men of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they re@@ pen@@ ted at the pre@@ aching of Jon@@ as ; and , be@@ hold , a greater than Jon@@ as is here .
when the un@@ clean spirit is gone out of a man , he walk@@ eth through d@@ ry places , seeking rest , and fin@@ de@@ th none .
then he sa@@ ith , I will return into my house from wh@@ ence I came out ; and when he is come , he fin@@ de@@ th it empty , swe@@ pt , and gar@@ n@@ ished .
while he yet talked to the people , be@@ hold , his mother and his bre@@ th@@ ren stood without , desi@@ ring to speak with him .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall do the will of my F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
the same day went J@@ es@@ us out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
and great multi@@ tu@@ des were gathered together un@@ to him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multi@@ tude stood on the shore .
and when he so@@ wed , some se@@ eds fell by the way side , and the fo@@ w@@ ls came and dev@@ oured them up :
some fell upon st@@ ony places , where they had not much ear@@ th : and for@@ th@@ with they sp@@ run@@ g up , because they had no deep@@ ness of ear@@ th :
and when the sun was up , they were scor@@ ched ; and because they had no root , they with@@ ered away .
he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Bec@@ ause it is given un@@ to you to know the my@@ ster@@ ies of the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en , but to them it is not given .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h , to him shall be given , and he shall have more ab@@ und@@ ance : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h not , from him shall be taken away even that he hat@@ h .
and in them is fulfilled the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of E@@ sa@@ ias , which sa@@ ith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perce@@ ive :
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one he@@ aret@@ h the word of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and under@@ stan@@ de@@ th it not , then co@@ me@@ th the w@@ ic@@ ked one , and cat@@ ch@@ eth away that which was so@@ wn in his heart . this is he which received se@@ ed by the way side .
he also that received se@@ ed among the thor@@ ns is he that he@@ aret@@ h the word ; and the care of this world , and the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ ches , ch@@ oke the word , and he bec@@ o@@ me@@ th un@@ fruit@@ ful .
but when the bla@@ de was sp@@ run@@ g up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tar@@ es also .
but he said , N@@ ay ; lest while ye gather up the tar@@ es , ye root up also the wheat with them .
another par@@ able put he forth un@@ to them , saying , The k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like to a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and so@@ wed in his field :
another par@@ able sp@@ ake he un@@ to them ; The k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to le@@ av@@ en , which a woman took , and hi@@ d in three measures of me@@ al , ti@@ ll the whole was le@@ av@@ ened .
all these things sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us un@@ to the multi@@ tude in par@@ ables ; and without a par@@ able sp@@ ake he not un@@ to them :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , I will open my m@@ outh in par@@ ables ; I will ut@@ ter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
then J@@ es@@ us sent the multi@@ tude away , and went into the house : and his dis@@ cip@@ les came un@@ to him , saying , declare un@@ to us the par@@ able of the tar@@ es of the field .
the field is the world ; the good se@@ ed are the children of the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but the tar@@ es are the children of the w@@ ic@@ ked one ;
the enemy that so@@ wed them is the dev@@ il ; the har@@ v@@ est is the end of the world ; and the re@@ apers are the an@@ gel@@ s .
as therefore the tar@@ es are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
then shall the righ@@ te@@ ous sh@@ ine forth as the sun in the k@@ ing@@ dom of their F@@ ather . who hat@@ h e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
again , the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
and it came to pass , that when J@@ es@@ us had finished these par@@ ables , he depar@@ ted th@@ ence .
for Her@@ od had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Her@@ odi@@ as ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and when he would have put him to death , he fear@@ ed the multi@@ tude , because they counted him as a pro@@ phe@@ t .
and the king was sor@@ ry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he comman@@ ded it to be given her .
and his head was brought in a char@@ ger , and given to the dam@@ sel : and she brought it to her mother .
and his dis@@ cip@@ les came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told J@@ es@@ us .
when J@@ es@@ us heard of it , he depar@@ ted th@@ ence by ship into a de@@ sert place apart : and when the people had heard there@@ of , they followed him on fo@@ ot out of the cities .
and J@@ es@@ us went forth , and saw a great multi@@ tude , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion toward them , and he he@@ aled their si@@ ck .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the frag@@ ments that remained twelve bas@@ kets full .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay J@@ es@@ us con@@ strained his dis@@ cip@@ les to get into a ship , and to go before him un@@ to the other side , while he sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away .
and when he had sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , he went up into a mountain apart to pra@@ y : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
and in the fourth watch of the night J@@ es@@ us went un@@ to them , walk@@ ing on the sea .
and when the dis@@ cip@@ les saw him walk@@ ing on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cri@@ ed out for fear .
then they that were in the ship came and wor@@ shi@@ pped him , saying , O@@ f a truth th@@ ou art the Son of God .
and when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gen@@ nes@@ aret .
and bes@@ ought him that they might only touch the hem of his gar@@ ment : and as many as touched were made perf@@ ec@@ tly whole .
Y@@ e hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , well did E@@ sa@@ ias pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y of you , saying ,
not that which go@@ eth into the m@@ outh def@@ il@@ eth a man ; but that which co@@ me@@ th out of the m@@ outh , this def@@ il@@ eth a man .
but he answ@@ ered and said , Every plant , which my heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather hat@@ h not plan@@ ted , shall be rooted up .
let them alone : they be b@@ lin@@ d leaders of the b@@ lin@@ d . and if the b@@ lin@@ d lead the b@@ lin@@ d , both shall fall into the di@@ t@@ ch .
do not ye yet understand , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever enter@@ eth in at the m@@ outh go@@ eth into the bel@@ ly , and is cast out into the dra@@ ught ?
but those things which proceed out of the m@@ outh come forth from the heart ; and they def@@ ile the man .
these are the things which def@@ ile a man : but to eat with un@@ w@@ ash@@ en hands def@@ il@@ eth not a man .
then J@@ es@@ us went th@@ ence , and depar@@ ted into the co@@ asts of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on .
then came she and wor@@ shi@@ pped him , saying , Lord , help me .
but he answ@@ ered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to do@@ gs .
then J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to her , O woman , great is TH@@ Y faith : be it un@@ to the@@ e even as th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and J@@ es@@ us depar@@ ted from th@@ ence , and came n@@ igh un@@ to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
and great multi@@ tu@@ des came un@@ to him , having with them those that were la@@ me , b@@ lin@@ d , dum@@ b , ma@@ imed , and many others , and cast them down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet ; and he he@@ aled them :
and he took the seven lo@@ aves and the fis@@ hes , and gave thanks , and br@@ ake them , and gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tude .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven bas@@ kets full .
and he sent away the multi@@ tude , and took ship , and came into the co@@ asts of Mag@@ dal@@ a ,
the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees also with the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es came , and temp@@ ting desi@@ red him that he would she@@ w them a sign from heav@@ en .
he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
a w@@ ic@@ ked and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous generation seek@@ eth after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given un@@ to it , but the sign of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jon@@ as . and he left them , and depar@@ ted .
and when his dis@@ cip@@ les were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
which when J@@ es@@ us perceived , he said un@@ to them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yo@@ ur@@ selves , because ye have brought no bread ?
how is it that ye do not understand that I sp@@ ake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should be@@ w@@ are of the le@@ av@@ en of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and of the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es ?
then understood they how that he b@@ ade them not be@@ w@@ are of the le@@ av@@ en of bread , but of the doc@@ tr@@ ine of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and of the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es .
when J@@ es@@ us came into the co@@ asts of Ca@@ es@@ area Philip@@ pi , he asked his dis@@ cip@@ les , saying , whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
and I say also un@@ to the@@ e , That th@@ ou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prev@@ ail against it .
and I will give un@@ to the@@ e the ke@@ ys of the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d on ear@@ th shall be bound in heav@@ en : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt loose on ear@@ th shall be lo@@ os@@ ed in heav@@ en .
but he turned , and said un@@ to Peter , G@@ et the@@ e behind me , S@@ atan : th@@ ou art an off@@ ence un@@ to me : for th@@ ou sav@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
then said J@@ es@@ us un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will save his life shall lose it : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
for what is a man pro@@ fi@@ ted , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own sou@@ l ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his sou@@ l ?
for the Son of man shall come in the gl@@ ory of his F@@ ather with his an@@ gel@@ s ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , There be some standing here , which shall not tas@@ te of death , ti@@ ll they see the Son of man coming in his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and was trans@@ fig@@ ured before them : and his face did sh@@ ine as the sun , and his ra@@ im@@ ent was white as the light .
and when the dis@@ cip@@ les heard it , they fell on their face , and were sor@@ e afraid .
and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save J@@ es@@ us only .
and as they came down from the mountain , J@@ es@@ us charged them , saying , T@@ ell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
but I say un@@ to you , That Eli@@ as is come already , and they knew him not , but have done un@@ to him wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they listed . likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
and when they were come to the multi@@ tude , there came to him a certain man , k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying ,
and J@@ es@@ us re@@ bu@@ ked the dev@@ il ; and he depar@@ ted out of him : and the child was cu@@ red from that very hour .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever therefore shall hum@@ ble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye desp@@ ise not one of these little ones ; for I say un@@ to you , That in heav@@ en their an@@ gel@@ s do always be@@ hold the face of my F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
and if so be that he find it , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth more of that she@@ ep , than of the n@@ in@@ ety and nine which went not as@@ tra@@ y .
even so it is not the will of your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en , that one of these little ones should per@@ ish .
but if he will not hear the@@ e , then take with the@@ e one or two more , that in the m@@ outh of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
and if he shall neglec@@ t to hear them , tell it un@@ to the church : but if he neglec@@ t to hear the church , let him be un@@ to the@@ e as an he@@ a@@ then man and a pub@@ lican .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall bin@@ d on ear@@ th shall be bound in heav@@ en : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall loose on ear@@ th shall be lo@@ os@@ ed in heav@@ en .
therefore is the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en lik@@ ened un@@ to a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
and when he had begun to rec@@ k@@ on , one was brought un@@ to him , which owed him ten thousand tal@@ ents .
but for@@ as@@ much as he had not to pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the ser@@ vant therefore fell down , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay the@@ e all .
then the lor@@ d of that ser@@ vant was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , and lo@@ os@@ ed him , and for@@ gave him the debt .
and his fel@@ low@@ ser@@ vant fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him , saying , H@@ ave patience with me , and I will pay the@@ e all .
so when his fel@@ low@@ servants saw what was done , they were very sor@@ ry , and came and told un@@ to their lor@@ d all that was done .
then his lor@@ d , after that he had called him , said un@@ to him , O th@@ ou w@@ ic@@ ked ser@@ vant , I for@@ gave the@@ e all that debt , because th@@ ou desi@@ red@@ st me :
and his lor@@ d was wro@@ th , and delivered him to the tor@@ ment@@ ors , ti@@ ll he should pay all that was due un@@ to him .
so likewise shall my heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather do also un@@ to you , if ye from your hear@@ ts for@@ give not every one his brother their t@@ res@@ passes .
and it came to pass , that when J@@ es@@ us had finished these say@@ ings , he depar@@ ted from Gal@@ il@@ ee , and came into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea beyond Jordan ;
he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Mos@@ es because of the hard@@ ness of your hear@@ ts suffered you to put away your wi@@ ves : but from the beginning it was not so .
and again I say un@@ to you , It is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to a man that is an hous@@ ehol@@ der , which went out early in the morning to h@@ ire la@@ bour@@ ers into his v@@ ine@@ yard .
and when he had agreed with the la@@ bour@@ ers for a pen@@ ny a day , he sent them into his v@@ ine@@ yard .
they say un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause no man hat@@ h hired us . he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , G@@ o ye also into the v@@ ine@@ yard ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lor@@ d of the v@@ ine@@ yard sa@@ ith un@@ to his ste@@ ward , C@@ all the la@@ bour@@ ers , and give them their h@@ ire , beginning from the last un@@ to the first .
and when they came that were hired about the ele@@ venth hour , they received every man a pen@@ ny .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a pen@@ ny .
and when they had received it , they mur@@ mu@@ red against the Go@@ od@@ man of the house ,
saying , These last have w@@ rought but one hour , and th@@ ou h@@ ast made them equal un@@ to us , which have bor@@ ne the burden and heat of the day .
take that th@@ ine is , and go TH@@ Y way : I will give un@@ to this last , even as un@@ to the@@ e .
is it not law@@ ful for me to do what I will with mine own ? is th@@ ine eye ev@@ il , because I am good ?
so the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
then came to him the mother of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e 's children with her sons , wor@@ shipping him , and desi@@ ring a certain thing of him .
and when the ten heard it , they were moved with in@@ dign@@ ation against the two bre@@ th@@ ren .
but it shall not be so among you : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
even as the Son of man came not to be minist@@ ered un@@ to , but to minister , and to give his life a ran@@ so@@ m for many .
and , be@@ hold , two b@@ lin@@ d men sitting by the way side , when they heard that J@@ es@@ us passed by , cri@@ ed out , saying , H@@ ave mer@@ cy on us , O Lord , th@@ ou Son of David .
and the multi@@ tude re@@ bu@@ ked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cri@@ ed the more , saying , H@@ ave mer@@ cy on us , O Lord , th@@ ou Son of David .
and if any man say ought un@@ to you , ye shall say , The Lord hat@@ h need of them ; and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay he will send them .
and brought the ass , and the col@@ t , and put on them their clo@@ th@@ es , and they set him there@@ on .
and a very great multi@@ tude spread their gar@@ ments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and stra@@ wed them in the way .
and the multi@@ tu@@ des that went before , and that followed , cri@@ ed , saying , Hos@@ anna to the Son of David : b@@ les@@ sed is he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord ; Hos@@ anna in the highest .
and the b@@ lin@@ d and the la@@ me came to him in the temp@@ le ; and he he@@ aled them .
and when the chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes saw the won@@ der@@ ful things that he did , and the children cr@@ ying in the temp@@ le , and saying , Hos@@ anna to the Son of David ; they were sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased ,
and he left them , and went out of the city into B@@ eth@@ any ; and he lo@@ d@@ ged there .
now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hun@@ gered .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , that they might receive the fru@@ its of it .
but last of all he sent un@@ to them his son , saying , They will rever@@ ence my son .
but when the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the he@@ ir ; come , let us kill him , and let us se@@ ize on his inher@@ it@@ ance .
and they caught him , and cast him out of the v@@ ine@@ yard , and sle@@ w him .
therefore say I un@@ to you , The k@@ ing@@ dom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fru@@ its there@@ of .
and when the chief pri@@ ests and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had heard his par@@ ables , they perceived that he sp@@ ake of them .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and sp@@ ake un@@ to them again by par@@ ables , and said ,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bid@@ den to the w@@ edding : and they would not come .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise :
and the re@@ mn@@ ant took his servants , and ent@@ re@@ ated them sp@@ ite@@ fully , and sle@@ w them .
but when the king heard there@@ of , he was wro@@ th : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those mur@@ der@@ ers , and burned up their city .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a w@@ edding gar@@ ment :
when they had heard these words , they mar@@ v@@ elled , and left him , and went their way .
now there were with us seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first , when he had married a wife , dec@@ eased , and , having no issue , left his wife un@@ to his brother :
for in the resur@@ rec@@ tion they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the an@@ gel@@ s of God in heav@@ en .
but as tou@@ ching the resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken un@@ to you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
but when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had heard that he had put the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es to sil@@ ence , they were gathered together .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , temp@@ ting him , and saying ,
J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all TH@@ Y heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y mind .
he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Ho@@ w then do@@ th David in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
then sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us to the multi@@ tude , and to his dis@@ cip@@ les ,
all therefore wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
for they bin@@ d heavy bur@@ den@@ s and gri@@ ev@@ ous to be bor@@ ne , and lay them on men 's sho@@ ul@@ ders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fin@@ gers .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phy@@ la@@ c@@ ter@@ ies , and en@@ large the borders of their gar@@ ments ,
and love the up@@ per@@ most rooms at fe@@ asts , and the chief seats in the syn@@ ago@@ gues ,
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall ex@@ alt himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that shall hum@@ ble himself shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
but wo@@ e un@@ to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! for ye shut up the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en against men : for ye neither go in yo@@ ur@@ selves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you , ye b@@ lin@@ d gu@@ ides , which say , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall swe@@ ar by the temp@@ le , it is nothing ; but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall swe@@ ar by the gold of the temp@@ le , he is a deb@@ tor !
and he that shall swe@@ ar by heav@@ en , swe@@ aret@@ h by the th@@ r@@ one of God , and by him that sit@@ te@@ th there@@ on .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! for ye make clean the outside of the c@@ up and of the plat@@ ter , but within they are full of ex@@ tor@@ tion and exc@@ ess .
T@@ ho@@ u b@@ lin@@ d P@@ har@@ is@@ ee , cleans@@ e first that which is within the c@@ up and plat@@ ter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
even so ye also ou@@ tw@@ ard@@ ly appear righ@@ te@@ ous un@@ to men , but within ye are full of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! because ye build the tom@@ bs of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and gar@@ nish the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the righ@@ te@@ ous ,
and say , If we had been in the days of our fa@@ thers , we would not have been par@@ tak@@ ers with them in the blood of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ye be witnesses un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that ye are the children of them which killed the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and J@@ es@@ us went out , and depar@@ ted from the temp@@ le : and his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him for to she@@ w him the buildings of the temp@@ le .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Se@@ e ye not all these things ? veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
for nation shall rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom : and there shall be fam@@ ines , and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ces , and earthquakes , in di@@ vers places .
then shall they deliver you up to be aff@@ lic@@ ted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all nations for my name 's sake .
and because in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall ab@@ ound , the love of many shall wa@@ x cold .
but he that shall en@@ dur@@ e un@@ to the end , the same shall be sav@@ ed .
and this g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the k@@ ing@@ dom shall be pre@@ ached in all the world for a witness un@@ to all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , stand in the hol@@ y place , ( wh@@ os@@ o re@@ ade@@ th , let him understand : )
let him which is on the hous@@ et@@ op not come down to take any thing out of his house :
and wo@@ e un@@ to them that are with child , and to them that give su@@ ck in those days !
but pra@@ y ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day :
for then shall be great tri@@ bu@@ lation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
and except those days should be shor@@ tened , there should no f@@ les@@ h be sav@@ ed : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shor@@ tened .
for there shall arise false Christ@@ s , and false pro@@ ph@@ ets , and shall she@@ w great signs and won@@ ders ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that , if it were possible , they shall dec@@ e@@ ive the very elect .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning co@@ me@@ th out of the east , and sh@@ in@@ eth even un@@ to the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tri@@ bu@@ lation of those days shall the sun be dar@@ ken@@ ed , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heav@@ en , and the powers of the heav@@ ens shall be shaken :
and he shall send his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heav@@ en to the other .
now learn a par@@ able of the fi@@ g tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth leaves , ye know that summer is n@@ igh :
so likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , This generation shall not pass , ti@@ ll all these things be fulfilled .
but as the days of No@@ e were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k ,
and knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
two women shall be gr@@ in@@ ding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
but know this , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known in what watch the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man co@@ me@@ th .
who then is a fa@@ ith@@ ful and wise ser@@ vant , whom his lor@@ d hat@@ h made ru@@ ler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
then shall the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en be lik@@ ened un@@ to ten vir@@ g@@ ins , which took their lam@@ ps , and went forth to meet the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om .
but the wise answ@@ ered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered un@@ to them his goods .
and un@@ to one he gave five tal@@ ents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay took his journey .
then he that had received the five tal@@ ents went and tra@@ ded with the same , and made them other five tal@@ ents .
but he that had received one went and dig@@ ged in the ear@@ th , and hi@@ d his lor@@ d 's money .
and so he that had received five tal@@ ents came and brought other five tal@@ ents , saying , Lord , th@@ ou deliver@@ ed@@ st un@@ to me five tal@@ ents : be@@ hold , I have gained bes@@ ide them five tal@@ ents more .
then he which had received the one tal@@ ent came and said , Lord , I knew the@@ e that th@@ ou art an hard man , re@@ ap@@ ing where th@@ ou h@@ ast not so@@ wn , and gathering where th@@ ou h@@ ast not stra@@ wed :
and I was afraid , and went and hi@@ d TH@@ Y tal@@ ent in the ear@@ th : lo , there th@@ ou h@@ ast that is th@@ ine .
take therefore the tal@@ ent from him , and give it un@@ to him which hat@@ h ten tal@@ ents .
for un@@ to every one that hat@@ h shall be given , and he shall have ab@@ und@@ ance : but from him that hat@@ h not shall be taken away even that which he hat@@ h .
when the Son of man shall come in his gl@@ ory , and all the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s with him , then shall he sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of his gl@@ ory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d divi@@ de@@ th his she@@ ep from the go@@ ats :
and he shall set the she@@ ep on his right hand , but the go@@ ats on the left .
nak@@ ed , and ye clo@@ th@@ ed me : I was si@@ ck , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came un@@ to me .
then shall he say also un@@ to them on the left hand , de@@ part from me , ye Cur@@ sed , into ever@@ lasting fire , prepared for the dev@@ il and his an@@ gel@@ s :
then assemb@@ led together the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people , un@@ to the palace of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has ,
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ her@@ es@@ o@@ ever this g@@ os@@ p@@ el shall be pre@@ ached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hat@@ h done , be told for a memorial of her .
now the first day of the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread the dis@@ cip@@ les came to J@@ es@@ us , saying un@@ to him , W@@ here w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou that we prepare for the@@ e to eat the pass@@ over ?
the Son of man go@@ eth as it is written of him : but wo@@ e un@@ to that man by whom the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
then Ju@@ das , which bet@@ ray@@ ed him , answ@@ ered and said , Mas@@ ter , is it I ? he said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast said .
and as they were e@@ ating , J@@ es@@ us took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed it , and br@@ ake it , and gave it to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and said , T@@ ake , eat ; this is my body .
but I say un@@ to you , I will not drink hen@@ ce@@ forth of this fruit of the v@@ ine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my F@@ ather 's k@@ ing@@ dom .
and when they had sun@@ g an hy@@ m@@ n , they went out into the mount of ol@@ ives .
and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and began to be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful and very heavy .
and he left them , and went away again , and pray@@ ed the third time , saying the same words .
then co@@ me@@ th he to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest : be@@ hold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
rise , let us be going : be@@ hold , he is at hand that do@@ th bet@@ ray me .
and they that had laid hold on J@@ es@@ us led him away to C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has the high pri@@ est , where the s@@ cri@@ bes and the el@@ ders were assemb@@ led .
but Peter followed him af@@ ar off un@@ to the high pri@@ est 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
now the chief pri@@ ests , and el@@ ders , and all the council , sought false witness against J@@ es@@ us , to put him to death ;
but J@@ es@@ us held his peace . and the high pri@@ est answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , I adj@@ ure the@@ e by the living God , that th@@ ou tell us whether th@@ ou be the Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of God .
then did they sp@@ it in his face , and bu@@ ffe@@ ted him ; and others smo@@ te him with the pal@@ ms of their hands ,
and when he was gone out into the por@@ ch , another ma@@ id saw him , and said un@@ to them that were there , This fellow was also with J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth .
and after a while came un@@ to him they that stood by , and said to Peter , su@@ rely th@@ ou also art one of them ; for TH@@ Y speech be@@ wr@@ ay@@ eth the@@ e .
when the morning was come , all the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders of the people took coun@@ sel against J@@ es@@ us to put him to death :
and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate the governor .
then Ju@@ das , which had bet@@ ray@@ ed him , when he saw that he was condemned , re@@ pen@@ ted himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders ,
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temp@@ le , and depar@@ ted , and went and han@@ ged himself .
and the chief pri@@ ests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not law@@ ful for to put them into the treas@@ ury , because it is the price of blood .
and when he was accused of the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders , he answ@@ ered nothing .
now at that feast the governor was won@@ t to release un@@ to the people a prison@@ er , whom they would .
then the soldiers of the governor took J@@ es@@ us into the common hall , and gathered un@@ to him the whole band of soldiers .
and they sp@@ it upon him , and took the Re@@ ed , and smo@@ te him on the head .
and after that they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off from him , and put his own ra@@ im@@ ent on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and as they came out , they found a man of Cy@@ ren@@ e , Simon by name : him they comp@@ elled to bear his cross .
and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , They par@@ ted my gar@@ ments among them , and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
then were there two th@@ i@@ ev@@ es cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
he tr@@ usted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
now from the sixth hour there was d@@ ark@@ ness over all the land un@@ to the ninth hour .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay one of them ran , and took a sp@@ un@@ ge , and filled it with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave him to drink .
and , be@@ hold , the ve@@ il of the temp@@ le was rent in tw@@ ain from the top to the bottom ; and the ear@@ th did quake , and the ro@@ cks rent ;
and came out of the graves after his resur@@ rec@@ tion , and went into the hol@@ y city , and appeared un@@ to many .
now when the centur@@ ion , and they that were with him , watching J@@ es@@ us , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they fear@@ ed greatly , saying , T@@ rul@@ y this was the Son of God .
among which was Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , and Mary the mother of James and Jos@@ es , and the mother of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e 's children .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , named Joseph , who also himself was J@@ es@@ us ' dis@@ cip@@ le :
and when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean lin@@ en clo@@ th ,
so they went , and made the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re sure , se@@ aling the stone , and setting a watch .
in the end of the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , as it began to da@@ wn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene and the other Mary to see the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and , be@@ hold , there was a great earthquake : for the an@@ gel of the Lord des@@ cen@@ ded from heav@@ en , and came and rol@@ led back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ered and said un@@ to the women , Fe@@ ar not ye : for I know that ye seek J@@ es@@ us , which was cru@@ ci@@ fied .
he is not here : for he is risen , as he said . come , see the place where the Lord lay .
and as they went to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les , be@@ hold , J@@ es@@ us met them , saying , All ha@@ il . and they came and held him by the feet , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
now when they were going , be@@ hold , some of the watch came into the city , and she@@ wed un@@ to the chief pri@@ ests all the things that were done .
so they took the money , and did as they were ta@@ ught : and this saying is com@@ mon@@ ly reported among the Jews until this day .
then the eleven dis@@ cip@@ les went away into Gal@@ il@@ ee , into a mountain where J@@ es@@ us had appointed them .
go ye therefore , and te@@ ach all nations , b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ing them in the name of the F@@ ather , and of the Son , and of the Holy gh@@ ost :
teaching them to observe all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have comman@@ ded you : and , lo , I am with you al@@ way , even un@@ to the end of the world . A@@ men .
and there went out un@@ to him all the land of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and they of Jer@@ usalem , and were all b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed of him in the river of Jordan , conf@@ essing their sin@@ s .
and John was clo@@ th@@ ed with C@@ ame@@ l 's ha@@ ir , and with a gir@@ dle of a s@@ kin about his lo@@ ins ; and he did eat loc@@ ust@@ s and wild hon@@ ey ;
and it came to pass in those days , that J@@ es@@ us came from N@@ azar@@ eth of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed of John in Jordan .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay coming up out of the water , he saw the heav@@ ens opened , and the Spiri@@ t like a do@@ ve des@@ cen@@ ding upon him :
and he was there in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty days , temp@@ ted of S@@ atan ; and was with the wild be@@ asts ; and the an@@ gel@@ s minist@@ ered un@@ to him .
now after that John was put in prison , J@@ es@@ us came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God ,
now as he walked by the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , he saw Simon and An@@ drew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fis@@ hers .
and when he had gone a little further th@@ ence , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , who also were in the ship men@@ ding their n@@ ets .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay he called them : and they left their father Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
and they went into Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um ; and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day he entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and ta@@ ught .
and they were ast@@ on@@ ished at his doc@@ tr@@ ine : for he ta@@ ught them as one that had authority , and not as the s@@ cri@@ bes .
and when the un@@ clean spirit had torn him , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice , he came out of him .
and for@@ th@@ with , when they were come out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , they entered into the house of Simon and An@@ drew , with James and John .
but Simon 's wife 's mother lay si@@ ck of a f@@ ever , and an@@ on they tell him of her .
and he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the f@@ ever left her , and she minist@@ ered un@@ to them .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought un@@ to him all that were dis@@ eased , and them that were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils .
and there came a le@@ per to him , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing him , and k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying un@@ to him , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t , th@@ ou can@@ st make me clean .
and J@@ es@@ us , moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and sa@@ ith un@@ to him , I will ; be th@@ ou clean .
and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy depar@@ ted from him , and he was cleans@@ ed .
and sa@@ ith un@@ to him , Se@@ e th@@ ou say nothing to any man : but go TH@@ Y way , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self to the pri@@ est , and offer for TH@@ Y cleansing those things which Mos@@ es comman@@ ded , for a testimony un@@ to them .
and again he entered into Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , after some days ; and it was no@@ ised that he was in the house .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay many were gathered together , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he pre@@ ached the word un@@ to them .
and they come un@@ to him , bringing one si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , which was bor@@ ne of four .
and when they could not come n@@ igh un@@ to him for the press , they uncovered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy lay .
when J@@ es@@ us saw their faith , he said un@@ to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , Son , TH@@ Y sin@@ s be for@@ given the@@ e .
and immediately when J@@ es@@ us perceived in his spirit that they so reas@@ oned within themselves , he said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y reason ye these things in your hear@@ ts ?
whether is it easier to say to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , Th@@ y sin@@ s be for@@ given the@@ e ; or to say , arise , and take up TH@@ Y bed , and walk ?
and immediately he ar@@ ose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that they were all amaz@@ ed , and gl@@ ori@@ fied God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
and as he passed by , he saw L@@ evi the son of Alp@@ ha@@ e@@ us sitting at the rece@@ ip@@ t of cust@@ om , and said un@@ to him , Fol@@ low me . and he ar@@ ose and followed him .
and it came to pass , that , as J@@ es@@ us sat at meat in his house , many public@@ ans and sin@@ ners sat also together with J@@ es@@ us and his dis@@ cip@@ les : for there were many , and they followed him .
when J@@ es@@ us heard it , he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , They that are whole have no need of the physi@@ cian , but they that are si@@ ck : I came not to call the righ@@ te@@ ous , but sin@@ ners to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
and the dis@@ cip@@ les of John and of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees used to fast : and they come and say un@@ to him , Wh@@ y do the dis@@ cip@@ les of John and of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees fast , but TH@@ Y dis@@ cip@@ les fast not ?
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Can the children of the bri@@ de@@ chamber fast , while the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om is with them ? as long as they have the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om with them , they can@@ not fast .
but the days will come , when the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
no man also se@@ w@@ eth a piece of new clo@@ th on an old gar@@ ment : else the new piece that filled it up tak@@ eth away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man p@@ ut@@ te@@ th new wine into old bott@@ les : else the new wine do@@ th bur@@ st the bott@@ les , and the wine is sp@@ il@@ led , and the bott@@ les will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bott@@ les .
and it came to pass , that he went through the cor@@ n fields on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n .
and he said un@@ to them , H@@ ave ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hun@@ g@@ red , he , and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high pri@@ est , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he entered again into the syn@@ ago@@ gue ; and there was a man there which had a with@@ ered hand .
and they watched him , whether he would he@@ al him on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; that they might accuse him .
and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees went forth , and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay took coun@@ sel with the Her@@ odi@@ ans against him , how they might destroy him .
and he sp@@ ake to his dis@@ cip@@ les , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multi@@ tude , lest they should th@@ r@@ ong him .
for he had he@@ aled many ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagu@@ es .
and un@@ clean spir@@ its , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cri@@ ed , saying , T@@ ho@@ u art the Son of God .
and he go@@ eth up into a mountain , and cal@@ le@@ th un@@ to him whom he would : and they came un@@ to him .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is bes@@ ide himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he will first bin@@ d the strong man ; and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
because they said , He hat@@ h an un@@ clean spirit .
there came then his bre@@ th@@ ren and his mother , and , standing without , sent un@@ to him , calling him .
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , be@@ hold my mother and my bre@@ th@@ ren !
and he ta@@ ught them many things by par@@ ables , and said un@@ to them in his doc@@ tr@@ ine ,
and it came to pass , as he so@@ wed , some fell by the way side , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
and some fell on st@@ ony ground , where it had not much ear@@ th ; and immediately it sp@@ ran@@ g up , because it had no dep@@ th of ear@@ th :
but when the sun was up , it was scor@@ ched ; and because it had no root , it with@@ ered away .
and some fell among thor@@ ns , and the thor@@ ns grew up , and ch@@ oked it , and it yi@@ elded no fruit .
and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sp@@ ran@@ g up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some six@@ ty , and some an hundred .
and when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the par@@ able .
and he said un@@ to them , un@@ to you it is given to know the my@@ ster@@ y of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God : but un@@ to them that are without , all these things are done in par@@ ables :
and these are they which are so@@ wn on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thir@@ ty@@ fold , some six@@ ty , and some an hundred .
for he that hat@@ h , to him shall be given : and he that hat@@ h not , from him shall be taken even that which he hat@@ h .
and he said , S@@ o is the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , as if a man should cast se@@ ed into the ground ;
for the ear@@ th br@@ ing@@ eth forth fruit of her@@ self ; first the bla@@ de , then the e@@ ar , after that the full cor@@ n in the e@@ ar .
but when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he p@@ ut@@ te@@ th in the si@@ ck@@ le , because the har@@ v@@ est is come .
and with many such par@@ ables sp@@ ake he the word un@@ to them , as they were able to hear it .
but without a par@@ able sp@@ ake he not un@@ to them : and when they were alone , he ex@@ po@@ unded all things to his dis@@ cip@@ les .
and the same day , when the even was come , he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Let us pass over un@@ to the other side .
and when they had sent away the multi@@ tude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and he was in the hin@@ der part of the ship , as@@ le@@ ep on a pil@@ low : and they aw@@ ake him , and say un@@ to him , Mas@@ ter , car@@ est th@@ ou not that we per@@ ish ?
and he ar@@ ose , and re@@ bu@@ ked the wind , and said un@@ to the sea , Peace , be still . and the wind ce@@ ased , and there was a great calm .
and they came over un@@ to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gad@@ aren@@ es .
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tom@@ bs a man with an un@@ clean spirit ,
who had his d@@ wel@@ ling among the tom@@ bs ; and no man could bin@@ d him , no , not with cha@@ ins :
because that he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been p@@ lu@@ cked as@@ under by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces : neither could any man t@@ ame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tom@@ bs , cr@@ ying , and cutting himself with stones .
and he bes@@ ought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
and they that f@@ ed the sw@@ ine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to J@@ es@@ us , and see him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and had the Legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they that saw it told them how it be@@ fell to him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and also concerning the sw@@ ine .
and when he was come into the ship , he that had been poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il pray@@ ed him that he might be with him .
and he depar@@ ted , and began to publish in Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is how great things J@@ es@@ us had done for him : and all men did mar@@ v@@ el .
and when J@@ es@@ us was passed over again by ship un@@ to the other side , much people gathered un@@ to him : and he was n@@ igh un@@ to the sea .
and had suffered many things of many physi@@ cians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bet@@ tered , but rather grew worse ,
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood was dri@@ ed up ; and she felt in her body that she was he@@ aled of that pla@@ gue .
but the woman fearing and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , kno@@ wing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
as soon as J@@ es@@ us heard the word that was spoken , he sa@@ ith un@@ to the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , Be not afraid , only believe .
and he co@@ me@@ th to the house of the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and se@@ eth the t@@ um@@ ult , and them that we@@ pt and w@@ ailed greatly .
and they la@@ ug@@ hed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay the dam@@ sel ar@@ ose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were ast@@ on@@ ished with a great ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment .
and he went out from th@@ ence , and came into his own country ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les follow him .
but J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , A pro@@ phe@@ t is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
and he could there do no m@@ igh@@ ty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few si@@ ck folk , and he@@ aled them .
and he mar@@ v@@ elled because of their un@@ belief . and he went round about the villages , teaching .
and comman@@ ded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no s@@ cri@@ p , no bread , no money in their pur@@ se :
and they cast out many dev@@ ils , and ano@@ in@@ ted with oil many that were si@@ ck , and he@@ aled them .
but when Her@@ od heard there@@ of , he said , It is John , whom I be@@ headed : he is risen from the dead .
and when a conven@@ i@@ ent day was come , that Her@@ od on his birthday made a Sup@@ per to his lor@@ ds , high cap@@ tains , and chief es@@ ta@@ tes of Gal@@ il@@ ee ;
and he sw@@ are un@@ to her , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt ask of me , I will give it the@@ e , un@@ to the half of my k@@ ing@@ dom .
and she came in stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay with has@@ te un@@ to the king , and asked , saying , I will that th@@ ou give me by and by in a char@@ ger the head of John the B@@ ap@@ tist .
and the king was exceeding sor@@ ry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sak@@ es which sat with him , he would not reject her .
and immediately the king sent an execu@@ tion@@ er , and comman@@ ded his head to be brought : and he went and be@@ headed him in the prison ,
and brought his head in a char@@ ger , and gave it to the dam@@ sel : and the dam@@ sel gave it to her mother .
and when his dis@@ cip@@ les heard of it , they came and took up his cor@@ p@@ se , and laid it in a tomb .
and the A@@ post@@ les gathered themselves together un@@ to J@@ es@@ us , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had ta@@ ught .
and he said un@@ to them , C@@ ome ye yo@@ ur@@ selves apart into a de@@ sert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no le@@ is@@ ure so much as to eat .
and the people saw them depar@@ ting , and many knew him , and ran af@@ oo@@ t th@@ ither out of all cities , and ou@@ tw@@ ent them , and came together un@@ to him .
and he comman@@ ded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green gr@@ ass .
and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fif@@ ties .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay he con@@ strained his dis@@ cip@@ les to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before un@@ to B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida , while he sent away the people .
but when they saw him walk@@ ing upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cri@@ ed out :
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Be of good che@@ er : it is I ; be not afraid .
and he went up un@@ to them into the ship ; and the wind ce@@ ased : and they were sor@@ e amaz@@ ed in themselves beyond measure , and won@@ dered .
for they considered not the mir@@ acle of the lo@@ aves : for their heart was har@@ dened .
and when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gen@@ nes@@ aret , and drew to the shore .
and when they were come out of the ship , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay they knew him ,
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were si@@ ck , where they heard he was .
then came together un@@ to him the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and certain of the s@@ cri@@ bes , which came from Jer@@ usalem .
and when they saw some of his dis@@ cip@@ les eat bread with def@@ iled , that is to say , with un@@ w@@ ash@@ en , hands , they found fault .
for the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and all the Jews , except they was@@ h their hands of@@ t , eat not , holding the tradition of the el@@ ders .
for lay@@ ing aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the w@@ ashing of po@@ ts and c@@ ups : and many other such like things ye do .
making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
and when he had called all the people un@@ to him , he said un@@ to them , Hear@@ ken un@@ to me every one of you , and understand :
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can def@@ ile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that def@@ ile the man .
and when he was entered into the house from the people , his dis@@ cip@@ les asked him concerning the par@@ able .
for from within , out of the heart of men , proceed ev@@ il th@@ ou@@ ghts , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies , for@@ nic@@ ations , murders ,
and from th@@ ence he ar@@ ose , and went into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hi@@ d .
for a certain woman , whose young daughter had an un@@ clean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
the woman was a Greek , a Sy@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ ic@@ ian by nation ; and she bes@@ ought him that he would cast forth the dev@@ il out of her daughter .
but J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it un@@ to the do@@ gs .
and when she was come to her house , she found the dev@@ il gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and again , depar@@ ting from the co@@ asts of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , he came un@@ to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , through the mid@@ st of the co@@ asts of Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
and they bring un@@ to him one that was de@@ af , and had an im@@ pedi@@ ment in his speech ; and they bes@@ e@@ ech him to put his hand upon him .
and he took him aside from the multi@@ tude , and put his fin@@ gers into his e@@ ars , and he sp@@ it , and touched his ton@@ gue ;
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay his e@@ ars were opened , and the str@@ ing of his ton@@ gue was lo@@ os@@ ed , and he sp@@ ake pla@@ in .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
and if I send them away fas@@ ting to their own houses , they will fa@@ int by the way : for di@@ vers of them came from far .
and they had a few small fis@@ hes : and he b@@ les@@ sed , and comman@@ ded to set them also before them .
so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven bas@@ kets .
and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heav@@ en , temp@@ ting him .
now the dis@@ cip@@ les had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one lo@@ af .
and he took the b@@ lin@@ d man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walk@@ ing .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , Ne@@ ither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and J@@ es@@ us went out , and his dis@@ cip@@ les , into the towns of Ca@@ es@@ area Philip@@ pi : and by the way he asked his dis@@ cip@@ les , saying un@@ to them , whom do men say that I am ?
and he began to te@@ ach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders , and of the chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and when he had called the people un@@ to him with his dis@@ cip@@ les also , he said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will save his life shall lose it ; but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall lose his life for my sake and the g@@ os@@ p@@ el 's , the same shall save it .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own sou@@ l ?
and he said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not tas@@ te of death , ti@@ ll they have seen the k@@ ing@@ dom of God come with power .
and after six days J@@ es@@ us tak@@ eth with him Peter , and James , and John , and le@@ ade@@ th them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was trans@@ fig@@ ured before them .
and his ra@@ im@@ ent became sh@@ ining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no ful@@ ler on ear@@ th can white them .
and there appeared un@@ to them Eli@@ as with Mos@@ es : and they were talking with J@@ es@@ us .
and Peter answ@@ ered and said to J@@ es@@ us , Mas@@ ter , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les ; one for the@@ e , and one for Mos@@ es , and one for Eli@@ as .
for he w@@ ist not what to say ; for they were sor@@ e afraid .
and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save J@@ es@@ us only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , ti@@ ll the Son of man were risen from the dead .
but I say un@@ to you , That Eli@@ as is indeed come , and they have done un@@ to him wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they listed , as it is written of him .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay all the people , when they be@@ held him , were greatly amaz@@ ed , and running to him sal@@ uted him .
and they brought him un@@ to him : and when he saw him , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay the spirit tar@@ e him ; and he fell on the ground , and w@@ allowed fo@@ am@@ ing .
and of@@ tti@@ mes it hat@@ h cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if th@@ ou can@@ st do any thing , have comp@@ as@@ sion on us , and help us .
when J@@ es@@ us saw that the people came running together , he re@@ bu@@ ked the f@@ oul spirit , saying un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u dum@@ b and de@@ af spirit , I charge the@@ e , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
but J@@ es@@ us took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he ar@@ ose .
and they depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and passed through Gal@@ il@@ ee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
for he ta@@ ught his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said un@@ to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and he came to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yo@@ ur@@ selves by the way ?
but they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
and he sat down , and called the twelve , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and ser@@ vant of all .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Ch@@ r@@ ist , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall not lose his reward .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall off@@ end one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and he were cast into the sea .
and if TH@@ Y hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life ma@@ imed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out : it is better for the@@ e to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
for every one shall be sal@@ ted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be sal@@ ted with salt .
and he ar@@ ose from th@@ ence , and co@@ me@@ th into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea by the far@@ ther side of Jordan : and the people resort un@@ to him again ; and , as he was won@@ t , he ta@@ ught them again .
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery .
but when J@@ es@@ us saw it , he was much disp@@ le@@ ased , and said un@@ to them , suffer the little children to come un@@ to me , and for@@ bid them not : for of such is the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall not receive the k@@ ing@@ dom of God as a little child , he shall not enter there@@ in .
and he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and b@@ les@@ sed them .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and k@@ ne@@ eled to him , and asked him , Go@@ od Mas@@ ter , what shall I do that I may inher@@ it eter@@ nal life ?
and the dis@@ cip@@ les were ast@@ on@@ ished at his words . but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ er@@ eth again , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in ri@@ ches to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God !
it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and they shall mo@@ ck him , and shall s@@ cour@@ ge him , and shall sp@@ it upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
and James and John , the sons of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , come un@@ to him , saying , Mas@@ ter , we would that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest do for us wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever we shall desire .
they said un@@ to him , G@@ rant un@@ to us that we may sit , one on TH@@ Y right hand , and the other on TH@@ Y left hand , in TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much disp@@ le@@ ased with James and John .
but J@@ es@@ us called them to him , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Y@@ e know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gen@@ ti@@ les exercise l@@ ord@@ ship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
but so shall it not be among you : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever of you will be the chi@@ ef@@ est , shall be ser@@ vant of all .
for even the Son of man came not to be minist@@ ered un@@ to , but to minister , and to give his life a ran@@ so@@ m for many .
and when he heard that it was J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth , he began to cry out , and say , J@@ es@@ us , th@@ ou Son of David , have mer@@ cy on me .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , What w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou that I should do un@@ to the@@ e ? the b@@ lin@@ d man said un@@ to him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
and they went their way , and found the col@@ t tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and they said un@@ to them even as J@@ es@@ us had comman@@ ded : and they let them go .
and they brought the col@@ t to J@@ es@@ us , and cast their gar@@ ments on him ; and he sat upon him .
and many spread their gar@@ ments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and stra@@ wed them in the way .
and they that went before , and they that followed , cri@@ ed , saying , Hos@@ anna ; b@@ les@@ sed is he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord :
b@@ les@@ sed be the k@@ ing@@ dom of our father David , that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord : Hos@@ anna in the highest .
and J@@ es@@ us entered into Jer@@ usalem , and into the temp@@ le : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out un@@ to B@@ eth@@ any with the twelve .
and on the mor@@ row , when they were come from B@@ eth@@ any , he was hun@@ gry :
and he ta@@ ught , saying un@@ to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of pray@@ er ? but ye have made it a den of th@@ i@@ ev@@ es .
and the s@@ cri@@ bes and chief pri@@ ests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they fear@@ ed him , because all the people was ast@@ on@@ ished at his doc@@ tr@@ ine .
and in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fi@@ g tree dri@@ ed up from the roots .
therefore I say un@@ to you , What things so@@ ever ye desire , when ye pra@@ y , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
and when ye stand pray@@ ing , for@@ give , if ye have ought against any : that your F@@ ather also which is in heav@@ en may for@@ give you your t@@ res@@ passes .
and they reas@@ oned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heav@@ en ; he will say , Wh@@ y then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , O@@ f men ; they fear@@ ed the people : for all men counted John , that he was a pro@@ phe@@ t indeed .
and at the season he sent to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men a ser@@ vant , that he might receive from the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
and they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent un@@ to them another ser@@ vant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away sha@@ me@@ fully handled .
but those hus@@ b@@ and@@ men said among themselves , This is the he@@ ir ; come , let us kill him , and the inher@@ it@@ ance shall be ours .
and they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
what shall therefore the lor@@ d of the v@@ ine@@ yard do ? he will come and destroy the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , and will give the v@@ ine@@ yard un@@ to others .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but fear@@ ed the people : for they knew that he had spoken the par@@ able against them : and they left him , and went their way .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , kno@@ wing their hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y temp@@ t ye me ? bring me a pen@@ ny , that I may see it .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said un@@ to them , ren@@ der to Ca@@ es@@ ar the things that are Ca@@ es@@ ar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . and they mar@@ v@@ elled at him .
now there were seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no se@@ ed .
and the seven had her , and left no se@@ ed : last of all the woman died also .
in the resur@@ rec@@ tion therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the an@@ gel@@ s which are in heav@@ en .
he is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly er@@ r .
and the second is like , name@@ ly this , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt love TH@@ Y neighbour as th@@ y@@ self . there is none other comman@@ d@@ ment greater than these .
and when J@@ es@@ us saw that he answ@@ ered discre@@ et@@ ly , he said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u art not far from the k@@ ing@@ dom of God . and no man after that dur@@ st ask him any question .
for David himself said by the Holy gh@@ ost , The Lord said to my Lord , sit th@@ ou on my right hand , ti@@ ll I make th@@ ine enem@@ ies TH@@ Y foot@@ st@@ ool .
and J@@ es@@ us sat over against the treas@@ ury , and be@@ held how the people cast money into the treas@@ ury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said un@@ to him , Se@@ est th@@ ou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom : and there shall be earthquakes in di@@ vers places , and there shall be fam@@ ines and troub@@ les : these are the begin@@ nings of sor@@ ro@@ ws .
but take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves : for they shall deliver you up to coun@@ cils ; and in the syn@@ ago@@ gues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rul@@ ers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall en@@ dur@@ e un@@ to the end , the same shall be sav@@ ed .
and let him that is on the hous@@ et@@ op not go down into the house , neither enter there@@ in , to take any thing out of his house :
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his gar@@ ment .
but wo@@ e to them that are with child , and to them that give su@@ ck in those days !
and except that the Lord had shor@@ tened those days , no f@@ les@@ h should be sav@@ ed : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hat@@ h chosen , he hat@@ h shor@@ tened the days .
and then shall he send his an@@ gel@@ s , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the ear@@ th to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of heav@@ en .
now learn a par@@ able of the fi@@ g tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
so ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is n@@ igh , even at the doors .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , that this generation shall not pass , ti@@ ll all these things be done .
but of that day and that hour know@@ eth no man , no , not the an@@ gel@@ s which are in heav@@ en , neither the Son , but the F@@ ather .
after two days was the feast of the pass@@ over , and of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
for ye have the poor with you always , and wh@@ en@@ so@@ ever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ her@@ es@@ o@@ ever this g@@ os@@ p@@ el shall be pre@@ ached throughout the whole world , this also that she hat@@ h done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
and when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conven@@ i@@ ently bet@@ ray him .
and the first day of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , when they killed the pass@@ over , his dis@@ cip@@ les said un@@ to him , W@@ here w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou that we go and prepare that th@@ ou may@@ est eat the pass@@ over ?
and he sen@@ de@@ th forth two of his dis@@ cip@@ les , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , G@@ o ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pit@@ cher of water : follow him .
and wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever he shall go in , say ye to the Go@@ od@@ man of the house , The Mas@@ ter sa@@ ith , W@@ here is the gu@@ est@@ chamber , where I shall eat the pass@@ over with my dis@@ cip@@ les ?
and his dis@@ cip@@ les went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said un@@ to them : and they made ready the pass@@ over .
and they began to be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and to say un@@ to him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
the Son of man indeed go@@ eth , as it is written of him : but wo@@ e to that man by whom the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat , J@@ es@@ us took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake it , and gave to them , and said , T@@ ake , eat : this is my body .
and he took the c@@ up , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all d@@ rank of it .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the v@@ ine , until that day that I drink it new in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and when they had sun@@ g an hy@@ m@@ n , they went out into the mount of ol@@ ives .
and they came to a place which was named Ge@@ th@@ sem@@ ane : and he sa@@ ith to his dis@@ cip@@ les , sit ye here , while I shall pra@@ y .
and he tak@@ eth with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sor@@ e amaz@@ ed , and to be very heavy ;
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and pray@@ ed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , AB@@ BA , F@@ ather , all things are possible un@@ to the@@ e ; take away this c@@ up from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t .
watch ye and pra@@ y , lest ye enter into temp@@ tation . the spirit truly is ready , but the f@@ les@@ h is weak .
and again he went away , and pray@@ ed , and sp@@ ake the same words .
and when he returned , he found them as@@ le@@ ep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither w@@ ist they what to answer him .
and he co@@ me@@ th the third time , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; be@@ hold , the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
and he that bet@@ ray@@ ed him had given them a to@@ ken , saying , Wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever I shall k@@ is@@ s , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away saf@@ ely .
and as soon as he was come , he go@@ eth stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay to him , and sa@@ ith , Mas@@ ter , master ; and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and they laid their hands on him , and took him .
and one of them that stood by drew a s@@ word , and smo@@ te a ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his e@@ ar .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Ar@@ e ye come out , as against a th@@ i@@ ef , with s@@ words and with st@@ aves to take me ?
and there followed him a certain young man , having a lin@@ en clo@@ th cast about his nak@@ ed body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and they led J@@ es@@ us away to the high pri@@ est : and with him were assemb@@ led all the chief pri@@ ests and the el@@ ders and the s@@ cri@@ bes .
and Peter followed him af@@ ar off , even into the palace of the high pri@@ est : and he sat with the servants , and war@@ med himself at the fire .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , su@@ rely th@@ ou art one of them : for th@@ ou art a Gal@@ il@@ a@@ ean , and TH@@ Y speech agre@@ eth there@@ to .
and the chief pri@@ ests accused him of many things : but he answ@@ ered nothing .
and there was one named Bar@@ ab@@ bas , which lay bound with them that had made insur@@ rec@@ tion with him , who had committed murder in the insur@@ rec@@ tion .
and the multi@@ tude cr@@ ying al@@ oud began to desire him to do as he had ever done un@@ to them .
and P@@ il@@ ate answ@@ ered and said again un@@ to them , What will ye then that I shall do un@@ to him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
then P@@ il@@ ate said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y , what ev@@ il hat@@ h he done ? and they cri@@ ed out the more exce@@ ed@@ ingly , C@@ ru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and so P@@ il@@ ate , willing to content the people , released Bar@@ ab@@ bas un@@ to them , and delivered J@@ es@@ us , when he had s@@ cour@@ ged him , to be cru@@ ci@@ fied .
and the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um ; and they call together the whole band .
and they clo@@ th@@ ed him with pur@@ ple , and plat@@ ted a cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns , and put it about his head ,
and they smo@@ te him on the head with a Re@@ ed , and did sp@@ it upon him , and bo@@ wing their k@@ ne@@ es wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
and when they had mo@@ cked him , they took off the pur@@ ple from him , and put his own clo@@ th@@ es on him , and led him out to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and they comp@@ el one Simon a Cy@@ ren@@ ian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Ru@@ f@@ us , to bear his cross .
and they bring him un@@ to the place gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , which is , being interpreted , The place of a s@@ kul@@ l .
and they gave him to drink wine min@@ g@@ led with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h : but he received it not .
and when they had cru@@ ci@@ fied him , they par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
and it was the third hour , and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him .
and the super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption of his accus@@ ation was written over , the King of the Jews .
and with him they cru@@ ci@@ fy two th@@ i@@ ev@@ es ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
and when the sixth hour was come , there was d@@ ark@@ ness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
and one ran and filled a sp@@ un@@ ge full of vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Eli@@ as will come to take him down .
and the ve@@ il of the temp@@ le was rent in tw@@ ain from the top to the bottom .
and when the centur@@ ion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cri@@ ed out , and gave up the gh@@ ost , he said , T@@ rul@@ y this man was the Son of God .
there were also women looking on af@@ ar off : among whom was Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Jos@@ es , and Sal@@ ome ;
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re at the rising of the sun .
and when they looked , they saw that the stone was rol@@ led away : for it was very great .
and entering into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clo@@ th@@ ed in a long white gar@@ ment ; and they were aff@@ righ@@ ted .
and he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Be not aff@@ righ@@ ted : Y@@ e seek J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth , which was cru@@ ci@@ fied : he is risen ; he is not here : be@@ hold the place where they laid him .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; for they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and were amaz@@ ed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
now when J@@ es@@ us was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , out of whom he had cast seven dev@@ ils .
and they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
after that he appeared in another form un@@ to two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
after@@ ward he appeared un@@ to the eleven as they sat at meat , and up@@ bra@@ i@@ ded them with their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
he that believ@@ eth and is b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed shall be sav@@ ed ; but he that believ@@ eth not shall be dam@@ ned .
so then after the Lord had spoken un@@ to them , he was received up into heav@@ en , and sat on the right hand of God .
and they went forth , and pre@@ ached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . A@@ men .
that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test know the certain@@ ty of those things , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast been instruc@@ ted .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ da@@ ea , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the course of A@@ bia : and his wife was of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth .
and they had no child , because that E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth was bar@@ ren , and they both were now well stric@@ ken in years .
and it came to pass , that while he executed the pri@@ est 's office before God in the order of his course ,
according to the cust@@ om of the pri@@ est 's office , his lot was to bur@@ n incen@@ se when he went into the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and the whole multi@@ tude of the people were pray@@ ing without at the time of incen@@ se .
and there appeared un@@ to him an an@@ gel of the Lord standing on the right side of the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
and when Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
but the an@@ gel said un@@ to him , Fe@@ ar not , Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias : for TH@@ Y pray@@ er is heard ; and TH@@ Y wife E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth shall bear the@@ e a son , and th@@ ou s@@ halt call his name John .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have joy and gla@@ d@@ ness ; and many shall re@@ jo@@ ice at his birth .
and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ering said un@@ to him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak un@@ to the@@ e , and to she@@ w the@@ e these glad ti@@ dings .
and when he came out , he could not speak un@@ to them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le : for he bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to them , and remained spe@@ ech@@ less .
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his minist@@ ration were accomplished , he depar@@ ted to his own house .
and in the sixth month the an@@ gel Gabriel was sent from God un@@ to a city of Gal@@ il@@ ee , named N@@ azar@@ eth ,
and the an@@ gel came in un@@ to her , and said , ha@@ il , th@@ ou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with the@@ e : b@@ les@@ sed art th@@ ou among women .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of sal@@ ut@@ ation this should be .
and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt conce@@ ive in TH@@ Y w@@ om@@ b , and bring forth a son , and s@@ halt call his name J@@ es@@ us .
he shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the High@@ est : and the Lord God shall give un@@ to him the th@@ r@@ one of his father David :
and he shall reign over the house of Jac@@ o@@ b for ever ; and of his k@@ ing@@ dom there shall be no end .
and , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y co@@ us@@ in E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth , she hat@@ h also conce@@ ived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called bar@@ ren .
and Mary ar@@ ose in those days , and went into the hill country with has@@ te , into a city of J@@ uda ;
and wh@@ ence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
for , lo , as soon as the voice of TH@@ Y sal@@ ut@@ ation so@@ unded in mine e@@ ars , the bab@@ e le@@ ap@@ ed in my w@@ om@@ b for joy .
and b@@ les@@ sed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
and Mary said , My sou@@ l do@@ th mag@@ ni@@ fy the Lord ,
and his mer@@ cy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
he hat@@ h she@@ wed strength with his arm ; he hat@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered the proud in the imag@@ ination of their hear@@ ts .
he hat@@ h put down the m@@ igh@@ ty from their seats , and ex@@ al@@ ted them of low degree .
he hat@@ h filled the hun@@ gry with good things ; and the rich he hat@@ h sent empty away .
he hat@@ h hol@@ p@@ en his ser@@ vant Israel , in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of his mer@@ cy ;
now E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and her neighbours and her co@@ usin@@ s heard how the Lord had she@@ wed great mer@@ cy upon her ; and they re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with her .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of his father .
and his m@@ outh was opened immediately , and his ton@@ gue lo@@ os@@ ed , and he sp@@ ake , and praised God .
and fear came on all that d@@ wel@@ t round about them : and all these say@@ ings were no@@ ised abroad throughout all the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ ea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hear@@ ts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
to perform the mer@@ cy promised to our fa@@ thers , and to remember his hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
and the child grew , and wa@@ xed strong in spirit , and was in the de@@ ser@@ ts ti@@ ll the day of his she@@ wing un@@ to Israel .
and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Ca@@ es@@ ar Aug@@ ust@@ us , that all the world should be tax@@ ed .
and all went to be tax@@ ed , every one into his own city .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ da@@ ea , un@@ to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ; ( because he was of the house and lin@@ e@@ age of David : )
and there were in the same country she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds abi@@ ding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
and , lo , the an@@ gel of the Lord came upon them , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord sh@@ one round about them : and they were sor@@ e afraid .
and this shall be a sign un@@ to you ; Y@@ e shall find the bab@@ e wrapped in sw@@ add@@ ling clo@@ th@@ es , lying in a man@@ ger .
and they came with has@@ te , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the bab@@ e lying in a man@@ ger .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and all they that heard it won@@ dered at those things which were told them by the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds .
and the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds returned , g@@ lor@@ ifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told un@@ to them .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circum@@ c@@ ising of the child , his name was called J@@ es@@ us , which was so named of the an@@ gel before he was conce@@ ived in the w@@ om@@ b .
and when the days of her pur@@ ification according to the law of Mos@@ es were accomplished , they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that open@@ eth the w@@ om@@ b shall be called hol@@ y to the Lord ; )
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons .
and , be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel : and the Holy gh@@ ost was upon him .
and it was revealed un@@ to him by the Holy gh@@ ost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for mine eyes have seen TH@@ Y sal@@ vation ,
and she coming in that in@@ stan@@ t gave thanks likewise un@@ to the Lord , and sp@@ ake of him to all them that looked for re@@ dem@@ ption in Jer@@ usalem .
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Gal@@ il@@ ee , to their own city N@@ azar@@ eth .
and the child grew , and wa@@ xed strong in spirit , filled with wis@@ dom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jer@@ usalem after the cust@@ om of the feast .
and when they found him not , they turned back again to Jer@@ usalem , seeking him .
and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temp@@ le , sitting in the mid@@ st of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
and he went down with them , and came to N@@ azar@@ eth , and was subject un@@ to them : but his mother kept all these say@@ ings in her heart .
Ann@@ as and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has being the high pri@@ ests , the word of God came un@@ to John the son of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
as it is written in the book of the words of E@@ sa@@ ias the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , The voice of one cr@@ ying in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Pre@@ par@@ e ye the way of the Lord , make his p@@ aths stra@@ ight .
every val@@ ley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the cro@@ oked shall be made stra@@ ight , and the roug@@ h ways shall be made smooth ;
then said he to the multi@@ tude that came forth to be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed of him , O generation of vi@@ pers , who hat@@ h warned you to flee from the wr@@ ath to come ?
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and begin not to say within yo@@ ur@@ selves , We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham to our father : for I say un@@ to you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : every tree therefore which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
he answ@@ er@@ eth and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , He that hat@@ h two co@@ ats , let him im@@ part to him that hat@@ h none ; and he that hat@@ h meat , let him do likewise .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throug@@ h@@ ly pur@@ ge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his gar@@ ner ; but the c@@ haf@@ f he will bur@@ n with fire un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble .
and J@@ es@@ us himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of H@@ eli ,
which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Ad@@ di , which was the son of Cos@@ am , which was the son of El@@ mo@@ dam , which was the son of E@@ R ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eli@@ ez@@ er , which was the son of Jor@@ im , which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of J@@ uda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jon@@ an , which was the son of Eli@@ ak@@ im ,
which was the son of M@@ ele@@ a , which was the son of Men@@ an , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ a , which was the son of Na@@ than , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of J@@ es@@ se , which was the son of Ob@@ ed , which was the son of Bo@@ oz , which was the son of sal@@ mon , which was the son of Na@@ as@@ son ,
which was the son of A@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , which was the son of Ara@@ m , which was the son of Es@@ rom , which was the son of P@@ har@@ es , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an , which was the son of Ar@@ p@@ ha@@ x@@ ad , which was the son of Se@@ m , which was the son of No@@ e , which was the son of La@@ me@@ ch ,
which was the son of M@@ ath@@ us@@ ala , which was the son of E@@ no@@ ch , which was the son of Jar@@ ed , which was the son of Mal@@ ele@@ el , which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an ,
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
and the dev@@ il , taking him up into an high mountain , she@@ wed un@@ to him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world in a moment of time .
and the dev@@ il said un@@ to him , All this power will I give the@@ e , and the gl@@ ory of them : for that is delivered un@@ to me ; and to wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever I will I give it .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , G@@ et the@@ e behind me , S@@ atan : for it is written , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt worship the Lord TH@@ Y God , and him only s@@ halt th@@ ou serve .
and he brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on a pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said un@@ to him , If th@@ ou be the Son of God , cast th@@ y@@ self down from hence :
and in their hands they shall bear the@@ e up , lest at any time th@@ ou d@@ ash TH@@ Y fo@@ ot against a stone .
and J@@ es@@ us returned in the power of the Spiri@@ t into Gal@@ il@@ ee : and there went out a f@@ ame of him through all the region round about .
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
but un@@ to none of them was Eli@@ as sent , save un@@ to Sar@@ ep@@ ta , a city of S@@ id@@ on , un@@ to a woman that was a wi@@ dow .
and many le@@ pers were in Israel in the time of E@@ lis@@ e@@ us the pro@@ phe@@ t ; and none of them was cleans@@ ed , saving Na@@ aman the Syrian .
and all they in the syn@@ ago@@ gue , when they heard these things , were filled with wr@@ ath ,
and rose up , and th@@ rust him out of the city , and led him un@@ to the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was built , that they might cast him down head@@ long .
and came down to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , a city of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and ta@@ ught them on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days .
and they were ast@@ on@@ ished at his doc@@ tr@@ ine : for his word was with power .
and they were all amaz@@ ed , and sp@@ ake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he comman@@ de@@ th the un@@ clean spir@@ its , and they come out .
and he ar@@ ose out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great f@@ ever ; and they bes@@ ought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any si@@ ck with di@@ vers diseases brought them un@@ to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gen@@ nes@@ aret ,
and saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fisher@@ men were gone out of them , and were w@@ ashing their n@@ ets .
now when he had left speaking , he said un@@ to Simon , La@@ un@@ ch out into the deep , and let down your n@@ ets for a dra@@ ught .
and when they had this done , they inc@@ los@@ ed a great multi@@ tude of fis@@ hes : and their net br@@ ake .
for he was ast@@ on@@ ished , and all that were with him , at the dra@@ ught of the fis@@ hes which they had taken :
but so much the more went there a f@@ ame abroad of him : and great multi@@ tu@@ des came together to hear , and to be he@@ aled by him of their in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities .
and , be@@ hold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a pal@@ sy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that where@@ on he lay , and depar@@ ted to his own house , g@@ lor@@ ifying God .
and they said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y do the dis@@ cip@@ les of John fast often , and make pray@@ ers , and likewise the dis@@ cip@@ les of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees ; but th@@ ine eat and drink ?
and he said un@@ to them , Can ye make the children of the bri@@ de@@ chamber fast , while the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om is with them ?
but new wine must be put into new bott@@ les ; and both are preserved .
and certain of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y do ye that which is not law@@ ful to do on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days ?
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering them said , H@@ ave ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hun@@ g@@ red , and they which were with him ;
and it came to pass also on another sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , that he entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue and ta@@ ught : and there was a man whose right hand was with@@ ered .
and the s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees watched him , whether he would he@@ al on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; that they might find an accus@@ ation against him .
and looking round about upon them all , he said un@@ to the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth TH@@ Y hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and they were filled with mad@@ ness ; and commun@@ ed one with another what they might do to J@@ es@@ us .
and it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pra@@ y , and continued all night in pray@@ er to God .
re@@ jo@@ ice ye in that day , and le@@ ap for joy : for , be@@ hold , your reward is great in heav@@ en : for in the like manner did their fa@@ thers un@@ to the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and un@@ to him that sm@@ ite@@ th the@@ e on the one che@@ ek offer also the other ; and him that tak@@ eth away TH@@ Y clo@@ ke for@@ bid not to take TH@@ Y co@@ at also .
give to every man that ask@@ eth of the@@ e ; and of him that tak@@ eth away TH@@ Y goods ask them not again .
and if ye do good to them which do good to you , what than@@ k have ye ? for sin@@ ners also do even the same .
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what than@@ k have ye ? for sin@@ ners also lend to sin@@ ners , to receive as much again .
the dis@@ cip@@ le is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but perce@@ iv@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
for a good tree br@@ ing@@ eth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither do@@ th a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thor@@ ns men do not gather fig@@ s , nor of a br@@ am@@ ble b@@ ush gather they grap@@ es .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever co@@ me@@ th to me , and he@@ aret@@ h my say@@ ings , and do@@ eth them , I will she@@ w you to whom he is like :
now when he had ended all his say@@ ings in the audience of the people , he entered into Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um .
and a certain centur@@ ion 's ser@@ vant , who was de@@ ar un@@ to him , was si@@ ck , and ready to die .
and when he heard of J@@ es@@ us , he sent un@@ to him the el@@ ders of the Jews , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing him that he would come and he@@ al his ser@@ vant .
and when they came to J@@ es@@ us , they bes@@ ought him in@@ stan@@ tly , saying , That he was wor@@ thy for whom he should do this :
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the ser@@ vant whole that had been si@@ ck .
and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called N@@ ain ; and many of his dis@@ cip@@ les went with him , and much people .
and when the Lord saw her , he had comp@@ as@@ sion on her , and said un@@ to her , We@@ ep not .
and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he delivered him to his mother .
and this rum@@ our of him went forth throughout all Ju@@ da@@ ea , and throughout all the region round about .
and in that same hour he cu@@ red many of their in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities and plagu@@ es , and of ev@@ il spir@@ its ; and un@@ to many that were b@@ lin@@ d he gave sight .
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clo@@ th@@ ed in soft ra@@ im@@ ent ? be@@ hold , they which are gor@@ ge@@ ously appar@@ elled , and live de@@ lic@@ ately , are in kings ' courts .
this is he , of whom it is written , be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before TH@@ Y face , which shall prepare TH@@ Y way before the@@ e .
for I say un@@ to you , A@@ mon@@ g those that are born of women there is not a greater pro@@ phe@@ t than John the B@@ ap@@ tist : but he that is least in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is greater than he .
and all the people that heard him , and the public@@ ans , justified God , being b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism of John .
for John the B@@ ap@@ tist came neither e@@ ating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hat@@ h a dev@@ il .
and one of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees desi@@ red him that he would eat with him . and he went into the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee 's house , and sat down to meat .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said un@@ to him , Simon , I have somewhat to say un@@ to the@@ e . and he sa@@ ith , Mas@@ ter , say on .
T@@ ho@@ u g@@ av@@ est me no k@@ is@@ s : but this woman since the time I came in hat@@ h not ce@@ ased to k@@ is@@ s my feet .
and it came to pass after@@ ward , that he went throughout every city and village , pre@@ aching and she@@ wing the glad ti@@ dings of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sp@@ run@@ g up , it with@@ ered away , because it la@@ cked mo@@ ist@@ ure .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then co@@ me@@ th the dev@@ il , and tak@@ eth away the word out of their hear@@ ts , lest they should believe and be sav@@ ed .
they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temp@@ tation fall away .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are ch@@ oked with car@@ es and ri@@ ches and pleas@@ ures of this life , and bring no fruit to perf@@ ection .
but that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
for nothing is secret , that shall not be made manif@@ est ; neither any thing hi@@ d , that shall not be known and come abroad .
take heed therefore how ye hear : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h , to him shall be given ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h not , from him shall be taken even that which he se@@ eme@@ th to have .
then came to him his mother and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and could not come at him for the press .
and he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , My mother and my bre@@ th@@ ren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his dis@@ cip@@ les : and he said un@@ to them , Let us go over un@@ to the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
but as they sa@@ iled he fell as@@ le@@ ep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeop@@ ard@@ y .
and they arrived at the country of the Gad@@ aren@@ es , which is over against Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had dev@@ ils long time , and w@@ are no clo@@ th@@ es , neither abo@@ de in any house , but in the tom@@ bs .
and J@@ es@@ us asked him , saying , What is TH@@ Y name ? and he said , Legi@@ on : because many dev@@ ils were entered into him .
and they bes@@ ought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
when they that f@@ ed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was poss@@ essed of the dev@@ ils was he@@ aled .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ es@@ us was returned , the people gla@@ dly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue : and he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and bes@@ ought him that he would come into his house :
for he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . but as he went the people th@@ ron@@ ged him .
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physi@@ cians , neither could be he@@ aled of any ,
came behind him , and touched the border of his gar@@ ment : and immediately her issue of blood stan@@ ched .
and when the woman saw that she was not hi@@ d , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him , she declared un@@ to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the ma@@ iden .
and he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , ma@@ id , arise .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very d@@ ust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and the A@@ post@@ les , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside priv@@ ately into a de@@ sert place belonging to the city called B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , and he@@ aled them that had need of he@@ aling .
then he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fis@@ hes , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed them , and br@@ ake , and gave to the dis@@ cip@@ les to set before the multi@@ tude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of frag@@ ments that remained to them twelve bas@@ kets .
he said un@@ to them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answ@@ ering said , The Ch@@ r@@ ist of God .
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders and chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be sla@@ in , and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will save his life shall lose it : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
for what is a man advant@@ aged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not tas@@ te of death , ti@@ ll they see the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these say@@ ings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pra@@ y .
and as he pray@@ ed , the fashion of his coun@@ tenance was alter@@ ed , and his ra@@ im@@ ent was white and g@@ list@@ ering .
and , be@@ hold , there talked with him two men , which were Mos@@ es and Eli@@ as :
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sle@@ ep : and when they were aw@@ ake , they saw his gl@@ ory , and the two men that stood with him .
while he thus sp@@ ake , there came a cl@@ oud , and over@@ shad@@ owed them : and they fear@@ ed as they entered into the cl@@ oud .
and when the voice was past , J@@ es@@ us was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
and , be@@ hold , a man of the company cri@@ ed out , saying , Mas@@ ter , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
and as he was yet a coming , the dev@@ il threw him down , and tar@@ e him . and J@@ es@@ us re@@ bu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and he@@ aled the child , and delivered him again to his father .
but they understood not this saying , and it was hi@@ d from them , that they perceived it not : and they fear@@ ed to ask him of that saying .
and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly set his face to go to Jer@@ usalem ,
and sent mes@@ sen@@ gers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samar@@ it@@ ans , to make ready for him .
and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jer@@ usalem .
and when his dis@@ cip@@ les James and John saw this , they said , Lord , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou that we command fire to come down from heav@@ en , and consum@@ e them , even as Eli@@ as did ?
but he turned , and re@@ bu@@ ked them , and said , Y@@ e know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said un@@ to him , Lord , I will follow the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou go@@ est .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to him , fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les , and birds of the air have nes@@ ts ; but the Son of man hat@@ h not where to lay his head .
after these things the Lord appointed other sev@@ enty also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , w@@ hi@@ ther he himself would come .
therefore said he un@@ to them , The har@@ v@@ est truly is great , but the la@@ bour@@ ers are few : pra@@ y ye therefore the Lord of the har@@ v@@ est , that he would send forth la@@ bour@@ ers into his har@@ v@@ est .
and if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
and in the same house remain , e@@ ating and drinking such things as they give : for the la@@ b@@ ou@@ rer is wor@@ thy of his h@@ ire . go not from house to house .
and into wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
and he@@ al the si@@ ck that are there@@ in , and say un@@ to them , The k@@ ing@@ dom of God is come n@@ igh un@@ to you .
but I say un@@ to you , that it shall be more toler@@ able in that day for So@@ dom , than for that city .
but it shall be more toler@@ able for T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on at the judgment , than for you .
be@@ hold , I give un@@ to you power to tre@@ ad on Ser@@ pen@@ ts and S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing in this re@@ jo@@ ice not , that the spir@@ its are subject un@@ to you ; but rather re@@ jo@@ ice , because your names are written in heav@@ en .
all things are delivered to me of my F@@ ather : and no man know@@ eth who the Son is , but the F@@ ather ; and who the F@@ ather is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
and he turned him un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said priv@@ ately , b@@ les@@ sed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
for I tell you , that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and kings have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
he said un@@ to him , What is written in the law ? how re@@ ade@@ st th@@ ou ?
and by chance there came down a certain pri@@ est that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
and likewise a Lev@@ ite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
but a certain Samar@@ itan , as he jour@@ ne@@ yed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had comp@@ as@@ sion on him ,
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Mar@@ th@@ a received him into her house .
and she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and heard his word .
and he said un@@ to them , When ye pra@@ y , say , Our F@@ ather which art in heav@@ en , H@@ allowed be TH@@ Y name . TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom come . TH@@ Y will be done , as in heav@@ en , so in ear@@ th .
and for@@ give us our sin@@ s ; for we also for@@ give every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temp@@ tation ; but deliver us from ev@@ il .
I say un@@ to you , Th@@ ough he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his impor@@ tun@@ ity he will rise and give him as many as he ne@@ ede@@ th .
and I say un@@ to you , As@@ k , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; kno@@ ck , and it shall be opened un@@ to you .
for every one that ask@@ eth recei@@ vet@@ h ; and he that seek@@ eth fin@@ de@@ th ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h it shall be opened .
if ye then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts un@@ to your children : how much more shall your heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather give the Holy Spiri@@ t to them that ask him ?
and he was casting out a dev@@ il , and it was dum@@ b . and it came to pass , when the dev@@ il was gone out , the dum@@ b sp@@ ake ; and the people won@@ dered .
but he , kno@@ wing their th@@ ou@@ ghts , said un@@ to them , Every k@@ ing@@ dom divided against itself is brought to de@@ so@@ lation ; and a house divided against a house fal@@ le@@ th .
but if I with the fin@@ ger of God cast out dev@@ ils , no doubt the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is come upon you .
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he tak@@ eth from him all his arm@@ our where@@ in he tr@@ usted , and divi@@ de@@ th his sp@@ o@@ ils .
he that is not with me is against me : and he that gather@@ eth not with me sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth .
when the un@@ clean spirit is gone out of a man , he walk@@ eth through d@@ ry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he sa@@ ith , I will return un@@ to my house wh@@ ence I came out .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spir@@ its more w@@ ic@@ ked than himself ; and they enter in , and d@@ well there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and it came to pass , as he sp@@ ake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ are the@@ e , and the pap@@ s which th@@ ou h@@ ast suc@@ ked .
for as Jon@@ as was a sign un@@ to the Nin@@ evi@@ tes , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
the men of Nin@@ eve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they re@@ pen@@ ted at the pre@@ aching of Jon@@ as ; and , be@@ hold , a greater than Jon@@ as is here .
no man , when he hat@@ h ligh@@ ted a cand@@ le , p@@ ut@@ te@@ th it in a secret place , neither under a b@@ ush@@ el , but on a cand@@ le@@ stick , that they which come in may see the light .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when th@@ ine eye is single , TH@@ Y whole body also is full of light ; but when th@@ ine eye is ev@@ il , TH@@ Y body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
if TH@@ Y whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright sh@@ ining of a cand@@ le do@@ th give the@@ e light .
and as he sp@@ ake , a certain P@@ har@@ is@@ ee bes@@ ought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and when the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee saw it , he mar@@ v@@ elled that he had not first was@@ hed before din@@ ner .
Y@@ e fo@@ ols , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
but rather give al@@ ms of such things as ye have ; and , be@@ hold , all things are clean un@@ to you .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you ! for ye build the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and your fa@@ thers killed them .
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the de@@ eds of your fa@@ thers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res .
and as he said these things un@@ to them , the s@@ cri@@ bes and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees began to urge him ve@@ hem@@ ently , and to prov@@ oke him to speak of many things :
lay@@ ing wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his m@@ outh , that they might accuse him .
for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hi@@ d , that shall not be known .
therefore wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye have spoken in d@@ ark@@ ness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the e@@ ar in clos@@ ets shall be proclaimed upon the hous@@ et@@ ops .
and I say un@@ to you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but I will fore@@ warn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hat@@ h killed hat@@ h power to cast into hell ; ye@@ a , I say un@@ to you , Fe@@ ar him .
but even the very ha@@ ir@@ s of your head are all num@@ ber@@ ed . fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many spar@@ ro@@ ws .
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bes@@ to@@ w my fru@@ its ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build greater ; and there will I bes@@ to@@ w all my fru@@ its and my goods .
and I will say to my sou@@ l , Sou@@ l , th@@ ou h@@ ast much goods laid up for many years ; take th@@ ine ease , eat , drink , and be mer@@ ry .
the life is more than meat , and the body is more than ra@@ im@@ ent .
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stat@@ ure one cu@@ bit ?
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
if then God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doub@@ t@@ ful mind .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your F@@ ather know@@ eth that ye have need of these things .
but rather seek ye the k@@ ing@@ dom of God ; and all these things shall be added un@@ to you .
and ye yo@@ ur@@ selves like un@@ to men that wait for their lor@@ d , when he will return from the w@@ edding ; that when he co@@ me@@ th and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open un@@ to him immediately .
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d when he co@@ me@@ th shall find watching : veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , that he shall gir@@ d himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , b@@ les@@ sed are those servants .
and this know , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known what hour the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man co@@ me@@ th at an hour when ye think not .
then Peter said un@@ to him , Lord , speak@@ est th@@ ou this par@@ able un@@ to us , or even to all ?
of a truth I say un@@ to you , that he will make him ru@@ ler over all that he hat@@ h .
and that ser@@ vant , which knew his lor@@ d 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stri@@ pes .
Sup@@ pose ye that I am come to give peace on ear@@ th ? I tell you , N@@ ay ; but rather division :
and he said also to the people , When ye see a cl@@ oud rise out of the west , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay ye say , There co@@ me@@ th a sho@@ wer ; and so it is .
and when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it co@@ me@@ th to pass .
Y@@ e hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sky and of the ear@@ th ; but how is it that ye do not dis@@ cer@@ n this time ?
or those E@@ igh@@ teen , upon whom the to@@ wer in Sil@@ o@@ am fell , and sle@@ w them , think ye that they were sin@@ ners above all men that d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem ?
then said he un@@ to the d@@ res@@ ser of his v@@ ine@@ yard , be@@ hold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fi@@ g tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cum@@ ber@@ eth it the ground ?
and , be@@ hold , there was a woman which had a spirit of in@@ fir@@ mity E@@ igh@@ teen years , and was bo@@ wed together , and could in no wise lift up her@@ self .
and when J@@ es@@ us saw her , he called her to him , and said un@@ to her , W@@ oman , th@@ ou art lo@@ os@@ ed from th@@ ine in@@ fir@@ mity .
and he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made stra@@ ight , and gl@@ ori@@ fied God .
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , whom S@@ atan hat@@ h bound , lo , these E@@ igh@@ teen years , be lo@@ os@@ ed from this bond on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his ad@@ vers@@ aries were as@@ ha@@ med : and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the g@@ lor@@ ious things that were done by him .
and he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and jour@@ ne@@ ying toward Jer@@ usalem .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
nevertheless I must walk to day , and to mor@@ row , and the day following : for it can@@ not be that a pro@@ phe@@ t per@@ ish out of Jer@@ usalem .
be@@ hold , your house is left un@@ to you de@@ so@@ late : and veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , b@@ les@@ sed is he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord .
and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief P@@ har@@ is@@ ees to eat bread on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , that they watched him .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering sp@@ ake un@@ to the lawyers and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , saying , Is it law@@ ful to he@@ al on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
and they held their peace . and he took him , and he@@ aled him , and let him go ;
and answ@@ ered them , saying , Wh@@ ich of you shall have an ass or an o@@ x fallen into a p@@ it , and will not stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay pull him out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever ex@@ al@@ te@@ th himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ ble@@ th himself shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
but when th@@ ou mak@@ est a feast , call the poor , the ma@@ imed , the la@@ me , the b@@ lin@@ d :
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is he that shall eat bread in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and they all with one consent began to make exc@@ use . the first said un@@ to him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pra@@ y the@@ e have me ex@@ cus@@ ed .
and the lor@@ d said un@@ to the ser@@ vant , G@@ o out into the highways and h@@ ed@@ ges , and comp@@ el them to come in , that my house may be filled .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ th not bear his cross , and come after me , can@@ not be my dis@@ cip@@ le .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sen@@ de@@ th an am@@ bas@@ sa@@ ge , and desi@@ re@@ th conditions of peace .
so likewise , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he be of you that for@@ sak@@ eth not all that he hat@@ h , he can@@ not be my dis@@ cip@@ le .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill ; but men cast it out . he that hat@@ h e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , do@@ th not light a cand@@ le , and swe@@ ep the house , and seek dil@@ ig@@ ently ti@@ ll she find it ?
and when she hat@@ h found it , she cal@@ le@@ th her friends and her neighbours together , saying , re@@ jo@@ ice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
and he would fa@@ in have filled his bel@@ ly with the hus@@ ks that the sw@@ ine did eat : and no man gave un@@ to him .
and when he came to himself , he said , Ho@@ w many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spar@@ e , and I per@@ ish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say un@@ to him , F@@ ather , I have sin@@ ned against heav@@ en , and before the@@ e ,
and he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
but the father said to his servants , Br@@ ing forth the best ro@@ be , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and sho@@ es on his feet :
and bring hi@@ ther the fat@@ ted cal@@ f , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be mer@@ ry :
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be mer@@ ry .
now his el@@ der son was in the field : and as he came and drew n@@ igh to the house , he heard musi@@ ck and dan@@ cing .
and he said un@@ to him , Th@@ y brother is come ; and TH@@ Y father hat@@ h killed the fat@@ ted cal@@ f , because he hat@@ h received him safe and sound .
but as soon as this TH@@ Y son was come , which hat@@ h dev@@ oured TH@@ Y living with har@@ lots , th@@ ou h@@ ast killed for him the fat@@ ted cal@@ f .
it was meet that we should make mer@@ ry , and be glad : for this TH@@ Y brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
and he said also un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les , There was a certain rich man , which had a ste@@ ward ; and the same was accused un@@ to him that he had was@@ ted his goods .
and he called him , and said un@@ to him , Ho@@ w is it that I hear this of the@@ e ? give an account of TH@@ Y ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship ; for th@@ ou may@@ est be no longer ste@@ ward .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , they may receive me into their houses .
then said he to another , An@@ d how much ow@@ est th@@ ou ? and he said , A@@ n hundred measures of wheat . and he said un@@ to him , T@@ ake TH@@ Y bill , and write fo@@ ur@@ score .
if therefore ye have not been fa@@ ith@@ ful in the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous mam@@ mon , who will commit to your trust the true ri@@ ches ?
and if ye have not been fa@@ ith@@ ful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
no ser@@ vant can serve two mas@@ ters : for either he will h@@ ate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and desp@@ ise the other . Y@@ e can@@ not serve God and mam@@ mon .
and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees also , who were c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous , heard all these things : and they der@@ i@@ ded him .
and it came to pass , that the beg@@ gar died , and was carried by the an@@ gel@@ s into Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's bos@@ om : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
and in hell he lift up his eyes , being in tor@@ ments , and se@@ eth Ab@@ ra@@ ham af@@ ar off , and Lazar@@ us in his bos@@ om .
and he cri@@ ed and said , F@@ ather Ab@@ ra@@ ham , have mer@@ cy on me , and send Lazar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his fin@@ ger in water , and co@@ ol my ton@@ gue ; for I am tor@@ mented in this fla@@ me .
it were better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and he cast into the sea , than that he should off@@ end one of these little ones .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves : if TH@@ Y brother t@@ res@@ pass against the@@ e , re@@ bu@@ ke him ; and if he rep@@ ent , for@@ give him .
and if he t@@ res@@ pass against the@@ e seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to the@@ e , saying , I rep@@ ent ; th@@ ou s@@ halt for@@ give him .
but which of you , having a ser@@ vant p@@ low@@ ing or fe@@ eding c@@ attle , will say un@@ to him by and by , when he is come from the field , G@@ o and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say un@@ to him , Mak@@ e ready where@@ with I may su@@ p , and gir@@ d th@@ y@@ self , and serve me , ti@@ ll I have e@@ aten and dr@@ un@@ ken ; and after@@ ward th@@ ou s@@ halt eat and drink ?
Do@@ th he than@@ k that ser@@ vant because he did the things that were comman@@ ded him ? I tro@@ w not .
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are comman@@ ded you , say , We are un@@ profitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and it came to pass , as he went to Jer@@ usalem , that he passed through the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia and Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and when he saw them , he said un@@ to them , G@@ o she@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the pri@@ ests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleans@@ ed .
and he said un@@ to the dis@@ cip@@ les , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , that ligh@@ ten@@ eth out of the one part under heav@@ en , sh@@ in@@ eth un@@ to the other part under heav@@ en ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
and as it was in the days of No@@ e , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
they did eat , they d@@ rank , they married wi@@ ves , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they d@@ rank , they bought , they sold , they plan@@ ted , they buil@@ ded ;
but the same day that lot went out of So@@ dom it ra@@ ined fire and bri@@ m@@ stone from heav@@ en , and destroyed them all .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
and shall not God av@@ en@@ ge his own elect , which cry day and night un@@ to him , though he bear long with them ?
the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee stood and pray@@ ed thus with himself , God , I than@@ k the@@ e , that I am not as other men are , ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , un@@ just , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , or even as this pub@@ lican .
and the pub@@ lican , standing af@@ ar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes un@@ to heav@@ en , but smo@@ te upon his bre@@ ast , saying , God be mer@@ ci@@ ful to me a sin@@ ner .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that ex@@ al@@ te@@ th himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ ble@@ th himself shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
and they brought un@@ to him also inf@@ ants , that he would touch them : but when his dis@@ cip@@ les saw it , they re@@ bu@@ ked them .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall not receive the k@@ ing@@ dom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter there@@ in .
and when J@@ es@@ us saw that he was very sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , he said , Ho@@ w hardly shall they that have ri@@ ches enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God !
for it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and they understood none of these things : and this saying was hi@@ d from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
and it came to pass , that as he was come n@@ igh un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o , a certain b@@ lin@@ d man sat by the way side beg@@ ging :
and they which went before re@@ bu@@ ked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cri@@ ed so much the more , T@@ ho@@ u Son of David , have mer@@ cy on me .
and , be@@ hold , there was a man named Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us , which was the chief among the public@@ ans , and he was rich .
and he sought to see J@@ es@@ us who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stat@@ ure .
and he ran before , and clim@@ bed up into a sy@@ com@@ ore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
and when J@@ es@@ us came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said un@@ to him , Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us , make has@@ te , and come down ; for to day I must abide at TH@@ Y house .
and when they saw it , they all mur@@ mu@@ red , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sin@@ ner .
and Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us stood , and said un@@ to the Lord ; be@@ hold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accus@@ ation , I restore him fo@@ ur@@ fold .
for the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
for I fear@@ ed the@@ e , because th@@ ou art an a@@ ust@@ ere man : th@@ ou tak@@ est up that th@@ ou lay@@ ed@@ st not down , and re@@ ap@@ est that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not so@@ w .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then g@@ av@@ est not th@@ ou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with us@@ ury ?
and he said un@@ to them that stood by , T@@ ake from him the po@@ und , and give it to him that hat@@ h ten po@@ unds .
and if any man ask you , Wh@@ y do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause the Lord hat@@ h need of him .
and they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said un@@ to them .
and they brought him to J@@ es@@ us : and they cast their gar@@ ments upon the col@@ t , and they set J@@ es@@ us there@@ on .
and he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and when he was come near , he be@@ held the city , and we@@ pt over it ,
saying , If th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st known , even th@@ ou , at least in this TH@@ Y day , the things which belong un@@ to TH@@ Y peace ! but now they are hi@@ d from th@@ ine eyes .
for the days shall come upon the@@ e , that th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall cast a tren@@ ch about the@@ e , and comp@@ ass the@@ e round , and keep the@@ e in on every side ,
and shall lay the@@ e even with the ground , and TH@@ Y children within the@@ e ; and they shall not leave in the@@ e one stone upon another ; because th@@ ou k@@ newest not the time of TH@@ Y vis@@ itation .
and he went into the temp@@ le , and began to cast out them that sold there@@ in , and them that bought ;
and he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
and they reas@@ oned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heav@@ en ; he will say , Wh@@ y then believed ye him not ?
then began he to speak to the people this par@@ able ; A certain man plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and let it forth to hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a ser@@ vant to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , that they should give him of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard : but the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men beat him , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent another ser@@ vant : and they beat him also , and ent@@ re@@ ated him sha@@ me@@ fully , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
but when the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men saw him , they reas@@ oned among themselves , saying , This is the he@@ ir : come , let us kill him , that the inher@@ it@@ ance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the v@@ ine@@ yard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lor@@ d of the v@@ ine@@ yard do un@@ to them ?
and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they fear@@ ed the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this par@@ able against them .
but he perceived their craf@@ tin@@ ess , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y temp@@ t ye me ?
and he said un@@ to them , ren@@ der therefore un@@ to Ca@@ es@@ ar the things which be Ca@@ es@@ ar 's , and un@@ to God the things which be God 's .
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they mar@@ v@@ elled at his answer , and held their peace .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said un@@ to them , The children of this world mar@@ ry , and are given in marriage :
but they which shall be accounted wor@@ thy to obtain that world , and the resur@@ rec@@ tion from the dead , neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage :
neither can they die any more : for they are equal un@@ to the an@@ gel@@ s ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resur@@ rec@@ tion .
now that the dead are raised , even Mos@@ es she@@ wed at the b@@ ush , when he cal@@ le@@ th the Lord the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b .
then certain of the s@@ cri@@ bes answ@@ ering said , Mas@@ ter , th@@ ou h@@ ast well said .
and he said , T@@ ake heed that ye be not dec@@ e@@ ived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and the time dra@@ w@@ eth near : go ye not therefore after them .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commo@@ tions , be not ter@@ ri@@ fied : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
and great earthquakes shall be in di@@ vers places , and fam@@ ines , and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ces ; and fear@@ ful sights and great signs shall there be from heav@@ en .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persec@@ ute you , deliver@@ ing you up to the syn@@ ago@@ gues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rul@@ ers for my name 's sake .
settle it therefore in your hear@@ ts , not to medi@@ t@@ ate before what ye shall answer :
and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all men for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the mid@@ st of it de@@ part out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
for these be the days of ven@@ ge@@ ance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
but wo@@ e un@@ to them that are with child , and to them that give su@@ ck , in those days ! for there shall be great dist@@ ress in the land , and wr@@ ath upon this people .
and there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the ear@@ th dist@@ ress of nations , with per@@ p@@ lex@@ ity ; the sea and the waves ro@@ aring ;
men 's hear@@ ts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the ear@@ th : for the powers of heav@@ en shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cl@@ oud with power and great gl@@ ory .
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your re@@ dem@@ ption dra@@ w@@ eth n@@ igh .
when they now sho@@ ot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now n@@ igh at hand .
so likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is n@@ igh at hand .
watch ye therefore , and pra@@ y always , that ye may be accounted wor@@ thy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temp@@ le ; and at night he went out , and abo@@ de in the mount that is called the mount of ol@@ ives .
now the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread drew n@@ igh , which is called the P@@ ass@@ over .
and he went his way , and commun@@ ed with the chief pri@@ ests and cap@@ tains , how he might bet@@ ray him un@@ to them .
then came the day of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , when the pass@@ over must be killed .
for I say un@@ to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the v@@ ine , until the k@@ ing@@ dom of God shall come .
but , be@@ hold , the hand of him that bet@@ ray@@ eth me is with me on the table .
and truly the Son of man go@@ eth , as it was determined : but wo@@ e un@@ to that man by whom he is bet@@ ray@@ ed !
and they began to inqu@@ ire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and there was also a stri@@ fe among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
but ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that do@@ th serve .
for whether is greater , he that sit@@ te@@ th at meat , or he that ser@@ vet@@ h ? is not he that sit@@ te@@ th at meat ? but I am among you as he that ser@@ vet@@ h .
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my k@@ ing@@ dom , and sit on th@@ ron@@ es jud@@ ging the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel .
and the Lord said , Simon , Simon , be@@ hold , S@@ atan hat@@ h desi@@ red to have you , that he may si@@ ft you as wheat :
and he said un@@ to them , When I sent you without pur@@ se , and s@@ cri@@ p , and sho@@ es , la@@ cked ye any thing ? and they said , No@@ thing .
then said he un@@ to them , But now , he that hat@@ h a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise his s@@ cri@@ p : and he that hat@@ h no s@@ word , let him sell his gar@@ ment , and buy one .
and he came out , and went , as he was won@@ t , to the mount of ol@@ ives ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les also followed him .
and when he was at the place , he said un@@ to them , pra@@ y that ye enter not into temp@@ tation .
and being in an ag@@ ony he pray@@ ed more ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly : and his swe@@ at was as it were great dro@@ ps of blood falling down to the ground .
and when he rose up from pray@@ er , and was come to his dis@@ cip@@ les , he found them sle@@ eping for sor@@ row ,
when they which were about him saw what would follow , they said un@@ to him , Lord , shall we sm@@ ite with the s@@ word ?
and one of them smo@@ te the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his right e@@ ar .
when I was daily with you in the temp@@ le , ye stret@@ ched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of d@@ ark@@ ness .
then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high pri@@ est 's house . and Peter followed af@@ ar off .
and when they had kin@@ d@@ led a fire in the mid@@ st of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
but a certain ma@@ id be@@ held him as he sat by the fire , and ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
and when they had b@@ lin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , who is it that smo@@ te the@@ e ?
and as soon as it was day , the el@@ ders of the people and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
and if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
then said they all , Art th@@ ou then the Son of God ? and he said un@@ to them , Y@@ e say that I am .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged un@@ to Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who himself also was at Jer@@ usalem at that time .
and Her@@ od with his men of war set him at n@@ ought , and mo@@ cked him , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in a gor@@ ge@@ ous ro@@ be , and sent him again to P@@ il@@ ate .
and the same day P@@ il@@ ate and Her@@ od were made friends together : for before they were at en@@ mity between themselves .
no , nor yet Her@@ od : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing wor@@ thy of death is done un@@ to him .
( who for a certain se@@ di@@ tion made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
but they cri@@ ed , saying , C@@ ru@@ ci@@ fy him , cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and he released un@@ to them him that for se@@ di@@ tion and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desi@@ red ; but he delivered J@@ es@@ us to their will .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cy@@ ren@@ ian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after J@@ es@@ us .
for , be@@ hold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , b@@ les@@ sed are the bar@@ ren , and the w@@ om@@ bs that never b@@ are , and the pap@@ s which never gave su@@ ck .
for if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the d@@ ry ?
and there were also two other , mal@@ ef@@ actors , led with him to be put to death .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Cal@@ v@@ ary , there they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and the mal@@ ef@@ actors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and the soldiers also mo@@ cked him , coming to him , and offering him vin@@ eg@@ ar ,
and a super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , this IS the King of the Jews .
but the other answ@@ ering re@@ bu@@ ked him , saying , D@@ ost not th@@ ou fear God , seeing th@@ ou art in the same condem@@ nation ?
and all the people that came together to that sight , be@@ holding the things which were done , smo@@ te their bre@@ asts , and returned .
and all his acqu@@ ain@@ tance , and the women that followed him from Gal@@ il@@ ee , stood af@@ ar off , be@@ holding these things .
and , be@@ hold , there was a man named Joseph , a coun@@ seller ; and he was a good man , and a just :
( the same had not consen@@ ted to the coun@@ sel and de@@ ed of them ; ) he was of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews : who also himself w@@ aited for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
this man went un@@ to P@@ il@@ ate , and beg@@ ged the body of J@@ es@@ us .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in lin@@ en , and laid it in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that was he@@ wn in stone , where@@ in never man before was laid .
and the women also , which came with him from Gal@@ il@@ ee , followed after , and be@@ held the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and how his body was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord J@@ es@@ us .
and it came to pass , as they were much per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed there@@ about , be@@ hold , two men stood by them in sh@@ ining gar@@ ments :
he is not here , but is risen : remember how he sp@@ ake un@@ to you when he was yet in Gal@@ il@@ ee ,
saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of s@@ inf@@ ul men , and be cru@@ ci@@ fied , and the third day rise again .
and returned from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and told all these things un@@ to the eleven , and to all the rest .
it was Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , and Jo@@ anna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things un@@ to the A@@ post@@ les .
then ar@@ ose Peter , and ran un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; and sto@@ op@@ ing down , he be@@ held the lin@@ en clo@@ th@@ es laid by themselves , and depar@@ ted , won@@ dering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and , be@@ hold , two of them went that same day to a village called Em@@ ma@@ us , which was from Jer@@ usalem about thre@@ es@@ core fur@@ lon@@ gs .
and it came to pass , that , while they commun@@ ed together and reas@@ oned , J@@ es@@ us himself drew near , and went with them .
and certain of them which were with us went to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed it , and br@@ ake , and gave to them .
and they said one to another , did not our heart bur@@ n within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the s@@ crip@@ tures ?
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jer@@ usalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
but they were ter@@ ri@@ fied and aff@@ righ@@ ted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
be@@ hold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hat@@ h not f@@ les@@ h and b@@ ones , as ye see me have .
and when he had thus spoken , he she@@ wed them his hands and his feet .
and they gave him a piece of a bro@@ iled fish , and of an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
and , be@@ hold , I send the promise of my F@@ ather upon you : but tar@@ ry ye in the city of Jer@@ usalem , until ye be en@@ du@@ ed with power from on high .
and he led them out as far as to B@@ eth@@ any , and he lifted up his hands , and b@@ les@@ sed them .
and it came to pass , while he b@@ les@@ sed them , he was par@@ ted from them , and carried up into heav@@ en .
in the beginning was the Wor@@ d , and the Wor@@ d was with God , and the Wor@@ d was God .
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the L@@ ight , that all men through him might believe .
that was the true L@@ ight , which ligh@@ te@@ th every man that co@@ me@@ th into the world .
but as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the f@@ les@@ h , nor of the will of man , but of God .
and the Wor@@ d was made f@@ les@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t among us , ( and we be@@ held his gl@@ ory , the gl@@ ory as of the only be@@ gotten of the F@@ ather , ) full of grace and truth .
no man hat@@ h seen God at any time ; the only be@@ gotten Son , which is in the bos@@ om of the F@@ ather , he hat@@ h declared him .
he it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose sho@@ e 's lat@@ ch@@ et I am not wor@@ thy to un@@ loose .
the next day John se@@ eth J@@ es@@ us coming un@@ to him , and sa@@ ith , be@@ hold the lam@@ b of God , which tak@@ eth away the sin of the world .
and I knew him not : but that he should be made manif@@ est to Israel , therefore am I come b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ing with water .
and John b@@ are record , saying , I saw the Spiri@@ t des@@ cen@@ ding from heav@@ en like a do@@ ve , and it abo@@ de upon him .
one of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was An@@ drew , Simon Peter 's brother .
and he brought him to J@@ es@@ us . and when J@@ es@@ us be@@ held him , he said , T@@ ho@@ u art Simon the son of J@@ ona : th@@ ou s@@ halt be called C@@ ep@@ has , which is by interpre@@ tation , A stone .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause I said un@@ to the@@ e , I saw the@@ e under the fi@@ g tree , believ@@ est th@@ ou ? th@@ ou s@@ halt see greater things than these .
and he sa@@ ith un@@ to him , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , Her@@ e@@ after ye shall see heav@@ en open , and the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding upon the Son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Gal@@ il@@ ee ; and the mother of J@@ es@@ us was there :
and both J@@ es@@ us was called , and his dis@@ cip@@ les , to the marriage .
and when they wanted wine , the mother of J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to him , They have no wine .
and there were set there six water@@ po@@ ts of stone , after the manner of the pur@@ ifying of the Jews , containing two or three fir@@ kins ap@@ i@@ ece .
after this he went down to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , he , and his mother , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his dis@@ cip@@ les : and they continued there not many days .
and the Jews ' pass@@ over was at hand , and J@@ es@@ us went up to Jer@@ usalem ,
and when he had made a s@@ cour@@ ge of small cor@@ ds , he dro@@ ve them all out of the temp@@ le , and the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his dis@@ cip@@ les remember@@ ed that he had said this un@@ to them ; and they believed the s@@ crip@@ ture , and the word which J@@ es@@ us had said .
now when he was in Jer@@ usalem at the pass@@ over , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the mir@@ ac@@ les which he did .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , except a man be born again , he can@@ not see the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
Nic@@ o@@ de@@ mu@@ s sa@@ ith un@@ to him , Ho@@ w can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and be born ?
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , except a man be born of water and of the Spiri@@ t , he can@@ not enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
that which is born of the f@@ les@@ h is f@@ les@@ h ; and that which is born of the Spiri@@ t is spirit .
the wind b@@ low@@ eth where it liste@@ th , and th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound there@@ of , but can@@ st not tell wh@@ ence it co@@ me@@ th , and w@@ hi@@ ther it go@@ eth : so is every one that is born of the Spiri@@ t .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
if I have told you earth@@ ly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heav@@ en@@ ly things ?
and no man hat@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en , but he that came down from heav@@ en , even the Son of man which is in heav@@ en .
and as Mos@@ es lifted up the ser@@ p@@ ent in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
for God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be sav@@ ed .
he that believ@@ eth on him is not condemned : but he that believ@@ eth not is condemned already , because he hat@@ h not believed in the name of the only be@@ gotten Son of God .
and this is the condem@@ nation , that light is come into the world , and men lov@@ ed d@@ ark@@ ness rather than light , because their de@@ eds were ev@@ il .
for every one that do@@ eth ev@@ il ha@@ te@@ th the light , neither co@@ me@@ th to the light , lest his de@@ eds should be re@@ proved .
but he that do@@ eth truth co@@ me@@ th to the light , that his de@@ eds may be made manif@@ est , that they are w@@ rought in God .
after these things came J@@ es@@ us and his dis@@ cip@@ les into the land of Ju@@ da@@ ea ; and there he tar@@ ried with them , and b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
and John also was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ing in A@@ enon near to Sal@@ im , because there was much water there : and they came , and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
Y@@ e yo@@ ur@@ selves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Ch@@ r@@ ist , but that I am sent before him .
he that hat@@ h the bri@@ de is the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om : but the friend of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , which stan@@ de@@ th and he@@ aret@@ h him , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth greatly because of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that co@@ me@@ th from above is above all : he that is of the ear@@ th is earth@@ ly , and speak@@ eth of the ear@@ th : he that co@@ me@@ th from heav@@ en is above all .
for he whom God hat@@ h sent speak@@ eth the words of God : for God gi@@ vet@@ h not the Spiri@@ t by measure un@@ to him .
then co@@ me@@ th he to a city of Samar@@ ia , which is called Sy@@ cha@@ r , near to the par@@ cel of ground that Jac@@ o@@ b gave to his son Joseph .
now Jac@@ o@@ b 's well was there . J@@ es@@ us therefore , being we@@ ar@@ ied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
( for his dis@@ cip@@ les were gone away un@@ to the city to buy meat . )
but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever drin@@ ket@@ h of the water that I shall give him shall never thir@@ st ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water spr@@ inging up into ever@@ lasting life .
the woman sa@@ ith un@@ to him , S@@ ir , give me this water , that I thir@@ st not , neither come hi@@ ther to draw .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast had five hus@@ bands ; and he whom th@@ ou now h@@ ast is not TH@@ Y husband : in that sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou truly .
Y@@ e worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for sal@@ vation is of the Jews .
but the hour co@@ me@@ th , and now is , when the true wor@@ ship@@ pers shall worship the F@@ ather in spirit and in truth : for the F@@ ather seek@@ eth such to worship him .
God is a Spiri@@ t : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
and he that re@@ ap@@ eth recei@@ vet@@ h wages , and gather@@ eth fruit un@@ to life eter@@ nal : that both he that so@@ w@@ eth and he that re@@ ap@@ eth may re@@ jo@@ ice together .
and many of the Samar@@ it@@ ans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
so when the Samar@@ it@@ ans were come un@@ to him , they bes@@ ought him that he would tar@@ ry with them : and he abo@@ de there two days .
and said un@@ to the woman , Now we believe , not because of TH@@ Y saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Sav@@ i@@ our of the world .
then when he was come into Gal@@ il@@ ee , the Gal@@ il@@ a@@ e@@ ans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jer@@ usalem at the feast : for they also went un@@ to the feast .
so J@@ es@@ us came again into Cana of Gal@@ il@@ ee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain no@@ ble@@ man , whose son was si@@ ck at Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um .
J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to him , G@@ o TH@@ Y way ; TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h . and the man believed the word that J@@ es@@ us had spoken un@@ to him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Th@@ y son li@@ vet@@ h .
then inqu@@ ired he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said un@@ to him , Y@@ es@@ ter@@ day at the seventh hour the f@@ ever left him .
after this there was a feast of the Jews ; and J@@ es@@ us went up to Jer@@ usalem .
now there is at Jer@@ usalem by the she@@ ep market a pool , which is called in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue B@@ eth@@ es@@ da , having five por@@ ches .
in these lay a great multi@@ tude of im@@ po@@ tent folk , of b@@ lin@@ d , halt , with@@ ered , waiting for the moving of the water .
and a certain man was there , which had an in@@ fir@@ mity thirty and eight years .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and he that was he@@ aled w@@ ist not who it was : for J@@ es@@ us had convey@@ ed himself away , a multi@@ tude being in that place .
the man depar@@ ted , and told the Jews that it was J@@ es@@ us , which had made him whole .
and therefore did the Jews persec@@ ute J@@ es@@ us , and sought to s@@ lay him , because he had done these things on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
for the F@@ ather lov@@ eth the Son , and she@@ w@@ eth him all things that himself do@@ eth : and he will she@@ w him greater works than these , that ye may mar@@ v@@ el .
for as the F@@ ather ra@@ is@@ eth up the dead , and quic@@ ken@@ eth them ; even so the Son quic@@ ken@@ eth whom he will .
for the F@@ ather jud@@ get@@ h no man , but hat@@ h committed all judgment un@@ to the Son :
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the F@@ ather . he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the Son hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the F@@ ather which hat@@ h sent him .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that he@@ aret@@ h my word , and believ@@ eth on him that sent me , hat@@ h ever@@ lasting life , and shall not come into condem@@ nation ; but is passed from death un@@ to life .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
for as the F@@ ather hat@@ h life in himself ; so hat@@ h he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
and hat@@ h given him authority to exec@@ ute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
mar@@ v@@ el not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , un@@ to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of life ; and they that have done ev@@ il , un@@ to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of dam@@ nation .
but I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be sav@@ ed .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the F@@ ather hat@@ h given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the F@@ ather hat@@ h sent me .
and the F@@ ather himself , which hat@@ h sent me , hat@@ h bor@@ ne witness of me . Y@@ e have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
and ye have not his word abi@@ ding in you : for whom he hat@@ h sent , him ye believe not .
I am come in my F@@ ather 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
do not think that I will accuse you to the F@@ ather : there is one that accus@@ eth you , even Mos@@ es , in whom ye trust .
after these things J@@ es@@ us went over the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , which is the sea of Ti@@ ber@@ ias .
and a great multi@@ tude followed him , because they saw his mir@@ ac@@ les which he did on them that were dis@@ eased .
and J@@ es@@ us went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his dis@@ cip@@ les .
and the pass@@ over , a feast of the Jews , was n@@ igh .
when J@@ es@@ us then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come un@@ to him , he sa@@ ith un@@ to Philip , Wh@@ ence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
and J@@ es@@ us said , Mak@@ e the men sit down . now there was much gr@@ ass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with the frag@@ ments of the five bar@@ ley lo@@ aves , which remained over and above un@@ to them that had e@@ aten .
then those men , when they had seen the mir@@ acle that J@@ es@@ us did , said , This is of a truth that pro@@ phe@@ t that should come into the world .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he depar@@ ted again into a mountain himself alone .
and when even was now come , his dis@@ cip@@ les went down un@@ to the sea ,
and entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um . and it was now dark , and J@@ es@@ us was not come to them .
so when they had ro@@ wed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ lon@@ gs , they see J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing n@@ igh un@@ to the ship : and they were afraid .
then they will@@ ingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land w@@ hi@@ ther they went .
( H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there came other boats from Ti@@ ber@@ ias n@@ igh un@@ to the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
when the people therefore saw that J@@ es@@ us was not there , neither his dis@@ cip@@ les , they also took shipping , and came to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , seeking for J@@ es@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hat@@ h sent .
for the bread of God is he which co@@ me@@ th down from heav@@ en , and gi@@ vet@@ h life un@@ to the world .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , I am the bread of life : he that co@@ me@@ th to me shall never hunger ; and he that believ@@ eth on me shall never thir@@ st .
all that the F@@ ather gi@@ vet@@ h me shall come to me ; and him that co@@ me@@ th to me I will in no wise cast out .
for I came down from heav@@ en , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
and this is the F@@ ather 's will which hat@@ h sent me , that of all which he hat@@ h given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
no man can come to me , except the F@@ ather which hat@@ h sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
it is written in the pro@@ ph@@ ets , An@@ d they shall be all ta@@ ught of God . every man therefore that hat@@ h heard , and hat@@ h learned of the F@@ ather , co@@ me@@ th un@@ to me .
not that any man hat@@ h seen the F@@ ather , save he which is of God , he hat@@ h seen the F@@ ather .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that believ@@ eth on me hat@@ h ever@@ lasting life .
this is the bread which co@@ me@@ th down from heav@@ en , that a man may eat there@@ of , and not die .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , except ye eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
W@@ hos@@ o e@@ ate@@ th my f@@ les@@ h , and drin@@ ket@@ h my blood , hat@@ h eter@@ nal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
he that e@@ ate@@ th my f@@ les@@ h , and drin@@ ket@@ h my blood , d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me , and I in him .
as the living F@@ ather hat@@ h sent me , and I live by the F@@ ather : so he that e@@ ate@@ th me , even he shall live by me .
this is that bread which came down from heav@@ en : not as your fa@@ thers did eat man@@ na , and are dead : he that e@@ ate@@ th of this bread shall live for ever .
what and if ye shall see the Son of man as@@ cen@@ d up where he was before ?
it is the spirit that quic@@ ken@@ eth ; the f@@ les@@ h pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th nothing : the words that I speak un@@ to you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for J@@ es@@ us knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should bet@@ ray him .
and he said , T@@ her@@ e@@ fore said I un@@ to you , that no man can come un@@ to me , except it were given un@@ to him of my F@@ ather .
and we believe and are sure that th@@ ou art that Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of the living God .
after these things J@@ es@@ us walked in Gal@@ il@@ ee : for he would not walk in Je@@ w@@ ry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
now the Jews ' feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les was at hand .
for there is no man that do@@ eth any thing in secret , and he himself seek@@ eth to be known openly . if th@@ ou do these things , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self to the world .
the world can@@ not h@@ ate you ; but me it ha@@ te@@ th , because I testify of it , that the works there@@ of are ev@@ il .
go ye up un@@ to this feast : I go not up yet un@@ to this feast ; for my time is not yet full come .
when he had said these words un@@ to them , he abo@@ de still in Gal@@ il@@ ee .
but when his bre@@ th@@ ren were gone up , then went he also up un@@ to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
now about the mid@@ st of the feast J@@ es@@ us went up into the temp@@ le , and ta@@ ught .
he that speak@@ eth of himself seek@@ eth his own gl@@ ory : but he that seek@@ eth his gl@@ ory that sent him , the same is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
Mos@@ es therefore gave un@@ to you circum@@ c@@ ision ; ( not because it is of Mos@@ es , but of the fa@@ thers ; ) and ye on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day circum@@ c@@ ise a man .
if a man on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day receive circum@@ c@@ ision , that the law of Mos@@ es should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every w@@ hit whole on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees heard that the people mur@@ mu@@ red such things concerning him ; and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and the chief pri@@ ests sent officers to take him .
Y@@ e shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , th@@ ither ye can@@ not come .
what manner of saying is this that he said , Y@@ e shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , th@@ ither ye can@@ not come ?
in the last day , that great day of the feast , J@@ es@@ us stood and cri@@ ed , saying , If any man thir@@ st , let him come un@@ to me , and drink .
many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , O@@ f a truth this is the Pro@@ phe@@ t .
others said , This is the Ch@@ r@@ ist . but some said , shall Ch@@ r@@ ist come out of Gal@@ il@@ ee ?
then came the officers to the chief pri@@ ests and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees ; and they said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y have ye not brought him ?
and early in the morning he came again into the temp@@ le , and all the people came un@@ to him ; and he sat down , and ta@@ ught them .
this they said , temp@@ ting him , that they might have to accuse him . but J@@ es@@ us sto@@ op@@ ed down , and with his fin@@ ger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said un@@ to them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning at the el@@ dest , even un@@ to the last : and J@@ es@@ us was left alone , and the woman standing in the mid@@ st .
she said , No man , Lord . and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to her , Ne@@ ither do I condemn the@@ e : go , and sin no more .
and yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the F@@ ather that sent me .
these words sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us in the treas@@ ury , as he ta@@ ught in the temp@@ le : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he sa@@ ith , W@@ hi@@ ther I go , ye can@@ not come .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
and he that sent me is with me : the F@@ ather hat@@ h not left me alone ; for I do always those things that ple@@ ase him .
I know that ye are Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's se@@ ed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hat@@ h no place in you .
I speak that which I have seen with my F@@ ather : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
they answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , Ab@@ ra@@ ham is our father . J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to them , If ye were Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's children , ye would do the works of Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , If God were your F@@ ather , ye would love me : for I proce@@ eded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
which of you convinc@@ eth me of sin ? and if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
he that is of God he@@ aret@@ h God 's words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my F@@ ather that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
then took they up stones to cast at him : but J@@ es@@ us hi@@ d himself , and went out of the temp@@ le , going through the mid@@ st of them , and so passed by .
and as J@@ es@@ us passed by , he saw a man which was b@@ lin@@ d from his birth .
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night co@@ me@@ th , when no man can work .
as long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
when he had thus spoken , he sp@@ at on the ground , and made cla@@ y of the sp@@ it@@ tle , and he ano@@ in@@ ted the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d man with the cla@@ y ,
and said un@@ to him , G@@ o , was@@ h in the pool of Sil@@ o@@ am , ( which is by interpre@@ tation , sent . ) He went his way therefore , and was@@ hed , and came seeing .
and it was the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day when J@@ es@@ us made the cla@@ y , and opened his eyes .
then again the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said un@@ to them , He put cla@@ y upon mine eyes , and I was@@ hed , and do see .
but the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been b@@ lin@@ d , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
but by what means he now se@@ eth , we know not ; or who hat@@ h opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
these words sp@@ ake his parents , because they fear@@ ed the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did conf@@ ess that he was Ch@@ r@@ ist , he should be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
we know that God sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es : as for this fellow , we know not from wh@@ ence he is .
the man answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y her@@ e@@ in is a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous thing , that ye know not from wh@@ ence he is , and yet he hat@@ h opened mine eyes .
now we know that God he@@ aret@@ h not sin@@ ners : but if any man be a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and do@@ eth his will , him he he@@ aret@@ h .
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born b@@ lin@@ d .
J@@ es@@ us heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said un@@ to him , D@@ ost th@@ ou believe on the Son of God ?
and J@@ es@@ us said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made b@@ lin@@ d .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that enter@@ eth not by the door into the she@@ ep@@ fold , but clim@@ bet@@ h up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
but he that enter@@ eth in by the door is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of the she@@ ep .
and when he p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth his own she@@ ep , he go@@ eth before them , and the she@@ ep follow him : for they know his voice .
and a st@@ ran@@ ger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of st@@ ran@@ gers .
this par@@ able sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us un@@ to them : but they understood not what things they were which he sp@@ ake un@@ to them .
all that ever came before me are th@@ i@@ ev@@ es and rob@@ bers : but the she@@ ep did not hear them .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be sav@@ ed , and shall go in and out , and find pas@@ ture .
the th@@ i@@ ef co@@ me@@ th not , but for to ste@@ al , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly .
the hi@@ re@@ ling fle@@ eth , because he is an hi@@ re@@ ling , and c@@ aret@@ h not for the she@@ ep .
and other she@@ ep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
therefore do@@ th my F@@ ather love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
no man tak@@ eth it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this comman@@ d@@ ment have I received of my F@@ ather .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my F@@ ather 's name , they bear witness of me .
but ye believe not , because ye are not of my she@@ ep , as I said un@@ to you .
and I give un@@ to them eter@@ nal life ; and they shall never per@@ ish , neither shall any man p@@ lu@@ ck them out of my hand .
my F@@ ather , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to p@@ lu@@ ck them out of my F@@ ather 's hand .
say ye of him , whom the F@@ ather hat@@ h sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and sent into the world , T@@ ho@@ u b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ st ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the F@@ ather is in me , and I in him .
now a certain man was si@@ ck , named Lazar@@ us , of B@@ eth@@ any , the town of Mary and her sister Mar@@ th@@ a .
( it was that Mary which ano@@ in@@ ted the Lord with o@@ in@@ tment , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir , whose brother Lazar@@ us was si@@ ck . )
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , Ar@@ e there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumb@@ le@@ th not , because he se@@ eth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night , he stumb@@ le@@ th , because there is no light in him .
these things said he : and after that he sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Our friend Lazar@@ us sle@@ ep@@ eth ; but I go , that I may aw@@ ake him out of sle@@ ep .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it J@@ es@@ us sp@@ ake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sle@@ ep .
and I am glad for your sak@@ es that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go un@@ to him .
then when J@@ es@@ us came , he found that he had la@@ in in the grave four days already .
and many of the Jews came to Mar@@ th@@ a and Mary , to comfor@@ t them concerning their brother .
then Mar@@ th@@ a , as soon as she heard that J@@ es@@ us was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to her , I am the resur@@ rec@@ tion , and the life : he that believ@@ eth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
and when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secre@@ tly , saying , The Mas@@ ter is come , and cal@@ le@@ th for the@@ e .
as soon as she heard that , she ar@@ ose quickly , and came un@@ to him .
now J@@ es@@ us was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Mar@@ th@@ a met him .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comfor@@ ted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up has@@ ti@@ ly and went out , followed her , saying , S@@ he go@@ eth un@@ to the grave to we@@ ep there .
then when Mary was come where J@@ es@@ us was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying un@@ to him , Lord , if th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st been here , my brother had not died .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews also we@@ eping which came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and some of them said , Co@@ uld not this man , which opened the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
J@@ es@@ us therefore again gro@@ an@@ ing in himself co@@ me@@ th to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
J@@ es@@ us said , T@@ ake ye away the stone . Mar@@ th@@ a , the sister of him that was dead , sa@@ ith un@@ to him , Lord , by this time he st@@ in@@ ket@@ h : for he hat@@ h been dead four days .
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and J@@ es@@ us lifted up his eyes , and said , F@@ ather , I than@@ k the@@ e that th@@ ou h@@ ast heard me .
and I knew that th@@ ou hear@@ est me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that th@@ ou h@@ ast sent me .
and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and fo@@ ot with gra@@ v@@ ec@@ lo@@ th@@ es : and his face was bound about with a n@@ ap@@ kin . J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Lo@@ ose him , and let him go .
then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which J@@ es@@ us did , believed on him .
but some of them went their ways to the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and told them what things J@@ es@@ us had done .
and one of them , named C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , being the high pri@@ est that same year , said un@@ to them , Y@@ e know nothing at all ,
J@@ es@@ us therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went th@@ ence un@@ to a country near to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , into a city called E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and there continued with his dis@@ cip@@ les .
and the Jews ' pass@@ over was n@@ igh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jer@@ usalem before the pass@@ over , to pur@@ ify themselves .
then sought they for J@@ es@@ us , and sp@@ ake among themselves , as they stood in the temp@@ le , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
now both the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had given a comman@@ d@@ ment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should she@@ w it , that they might take him .
then J@@ es@@ us six days before the pass@@ over came to B@@ eth@@ any , where Lazar@@ us was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
there they made him a Sup@@ per ; and Mar@@ th@@ a served : but Lazar@@ us was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took Mary a po@@ und of o@@ in@@ tment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard , very costly , and ano@@ in@@ ted the feet of J@@ es@@ us , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir : and the house was filled with the od@@ our of the o@@ in@@ tment .
this he said , not that he car@@ ed for the poor ; but because he was a th@@ i@@ ef , and had the bag , and b@@ are what was put there@@ in .
but the chief pri@@ ests consul@@ ted that they might put Lazar@@ us also to death ;
because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on J@@ es@@ us .
on the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that J@@ es@@ us was coming to Jer@@ usalem ,
took branches of pal@@ m trees , and went forth to meet him , and cri@@ ed , Hos@@ anna : b@@ les@@ sed is the King of Israel that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord .
these things understood not his dis@@ cip@@ les at the first : but when J@@ es@@ us was gl@@ ori@@ fied , then remember@@ ed they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things un@@ to him .
the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazar@@ us out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , b@@ are record .
for this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this mir@@ acle .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be gl@@ ori@@ fied .
he that lov@@ eth his life shall lose it ; and he that ha@@ te@@ th his life in this world shall keep it un@@ to life eter@@ nal .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my ser@@ vant be : if any man serve me , him will my F@@ ather honour .
and I , if I be lifted up from the ear@@ th , will draw all men un@@ to me .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us , and depar@@ ted , and did hide himself from them .
but though he had done so many mir@@ ac@@ les before them , yet they believed not on him :
that the saying of E@@ sa@@ ias the pro@@ phe@@ t might be fulfilled , which he sp@@ ake , Lord , who hat@@ h believed our report ? and to whom hat@@ h the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
nevertheless among the chief rul@@ ers also many believed on him ; but because of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees they did not conf@@ ess him , lest they should be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue :
I am come a light into the world , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever believ@@ eth on me should not abide in d@@ ark@@ ness .
he that rej@@ ec@@ te@@ th me , and recei@@ vet@@ h not my words , hat@@ h one that jud@@ get@@ h him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the F@@ ather which sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
and Sup@@ per being ended , the dev@@ il having now put into the heart of Ju@@ das Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , Simon 's son , to bet@@ ray him ;
J@@ es@@ us kno@@ wing that the F@@ ather had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
he ris@@ eth from Sup@@ per , and laid aside his gar@@ ments ; and took a tow@@ el , and gir@@ ded himself .
after that he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th water into a bas@@ on , and began to was@@ h the dis@@ cip@@ les ' feet , and to wi@@ pe them with the tow@@ el where@@ with he was gir@@ ded .
if I then , your Lord and Mas@@ ter , have was@@ hed your feet ; ye also ought to was@@ h one another 's feet .
for I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the s@@ crip@@ ture may be fulfilled , He that e@@ ate@@ th bread with me hat@@ h lifted up his he@@ el against me .
now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
when J@@ es@@ us had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , that one of you shall bet@@ ray me .
now there was le@@ an@@ ing on J@@ es@@ us ' bos@@ om one of his dis@@ cip@@ les , whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed .
Simon Peter therefore bec@@ kon@@ ed to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he sp@@ ake .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , He it is , to whom I shall give a So@@ p , when I have di@@ pped it . and when he had di@@ pped the So@@ p , he gave it to Ju@@ das Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , the son of Simon .
little children , yet a little while I am with you . Y@@ e shall seek me : and as I said un@@ to the Jews , W@@ hi@@ ther I go , ye can@@ not come ; so now I say to you .
a new comman@@ d@@ ment I give un@@ to you , That ye love one another ; as I have lov@@ ed you , that ye also love one another .
by this shall all men know that ye are my dis@@ cip@@ les , if ye have love one to another .
in my F@@ ather 's house are many man@@ sions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you un@@ to myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
if ye had known me , ye should have known my F@@ ather also : and from hen@@ ce@@ forth ye know him , and have seen him .
believe me that I am in the F@@ ather , and the F@@ ather in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that believ@@ eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go un@@ to my F@@ ather .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the F@@ ather may be gl@@ ori@@ fied in the Son .
if ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it .
yet a little while , and the world se@@ eth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
at that day ye shall know that I am in my F@@ ather , and ye in me , and I in you .
he that hat@@ h my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keep@@ eth them , he it is that lov@@ eth me : and he that lov@@ eth me shall be lov@@ ed of my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will manif@@ est myself to him .
he that lov@@ eth me not keep@@ eth not my say@@ ings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the F@@ ather 's which sent me .
but the Com@@ for@@ ter , which is the Holy gh@@ ost , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he shall te@@ ach you all things , and bring all things to your re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have said un@@ to you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give un@@ to you : not as the world gi@@ vet@@ h , give I un@@ to you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
and now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
every branch in me that be@@ aret@@ h not fruit he tak@@ eth away : and every branch that be@@ aret@@ h fruit , he pur@@ get@@ h it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken un@@ to you .
abide in me , and I in you . as the branch can@@ not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the v@@ ine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the v@@ ine , ye are the branches : he that abi@@ de@@ th in me , and I in him , the same br@@ ing@@ eth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done un@@ to you .
her@@ e@@ in is my F@@ ather gl@@ ori@@ fied , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my dis@@ cip@@ les .
if ye keep my comman@@ d@@ ments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my F@@ ather 's comman@@ d@@ ments , and abide in his love .
these things have I spoken un@@ to you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
this is my comman@@ d@@ ment , That ye love one another , as I have lov@@ ed you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world ha@@ te@@ th you .
remember the word that I said un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . if they have persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but all these things will they do un@@ to you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
if I had not come and spoken un@@ to them , they had not had sin : but now they have no clo@@ ke for their sin .
if I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and ha@@ ted both me and my F@@ ather .
but this co@@ me@@ th to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They ha@@ ted me without a cause .
but when the Com@@ for@@ ter is come , whom I will send un@@ to you from the F@@ ather , even the Spiri@@ t of truth , which proce@@ ede@@ th from the F@@ ather , he shall testify of me :
and ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
they shall put you out of the syn@@ ago@@ gues : ye@@ a , the time co@@ me@@ th , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever kil@@ le@@ th you will think that he do@@ eth God service .
and these things will they do un@@ to you , because they have not known the F@@ ather , nor me .
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not un@@ to you at the beginning , because I was with you .
but because I have said these things un@@ to you , sor@@ row hat@@ h filled your heart .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedi@@ ent for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come un@@ to you ; but if I de@@ part , I will send him un@@ to you .
and when he is come , he will re@@ prove the world of sin , and of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and of judgment :
he shall g@@ lor@@ ify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall she@@ w it un@@ to you .
all things that the F@@ ather hat@@ h are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall she@@ w it un@@ to you .
a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the F@@ ather .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , That ye shall we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world shall re@@ jo@@ ice : and ye shall be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row shall be turned into joy .
and ye now therefore have sor@@ row : but I will see you again , and your heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and your joy no man tak@@ eth from you .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall ask the F@@ ather in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken un@@ to you in Pro@@ ver@@ bs : but the time co@@ me@@ th , when I shall no more speak un@@ to you in Pro@@ ver@@ bs , but I shall she@@ w you pla@@ in@@ ly of the F@@ ather .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not un@@ to you , that I will pra@@ y the F@@ ather for you :
for the F@@ ather himself lov@@ eth you , because ye have lov@@ ed me , and have believed that I came out from God .
I came forth from the F@@ ather , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the F@@ ather .
now are we sure that th@@ ou know@@ est all things , and ne@@ ede@@ st not that any man should ask the@@ e : by this we believe that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth from God .
be@@ hold , the hour co@@ me@@ th , ye@@ a , is now come , that ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
these words sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us , and lifted up his eyes to heav@@ en , and said , F@@ ather , the hour is come ; g@@ lor@@ ify TH@@ Y Son , that TH@@ Y Son also may g@@ lor@@ ify the@@ e :
as th@@ ou h@@ ast given him power over all f@@ les@@ h , that he should give eter@@ nal life to as many as th@@ ou h@@ ast given him .
and this is life eter@@ nal , that they might know the@@ e the only true God , and J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast sent .
I have gl@@ ori@@ fied the@@ e on the ear@@ th : I have finished the work which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me to do .
and now , O F@@ ather , g@@ lor@@ ify th@@ ou me with th@@ ine own self with the gl@@ ory which I had with the@@ e before the world was .
I have manif@@ ested TH@@ Y name un@@ to the men which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me out of the world : th@@ ine they were , and th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them me ; and they have kept TH@@ Y word .
now they have known that all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou h@@ ast given me are of the@@ e .
for I have given un@@ to them the words which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me ; and they have received them , and have known su@@ rely that I came out from the@@ e , and they have believed that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st send me .
and now come I to the@@ e ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
I have given them TH@@ Y word ; and the world hat@@ h ha@@ ted them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pra@@ y not that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take them out of the world , but that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest keep them from the ev@@ il .
as th@@ ou h@@ ast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
and for their sak@@ es I sanc@@ ti@@ fy myself , that they also might be sanc@@ ti@@ fied through the truth .
and the gl@@ ory which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
I in them , and th@@ ou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that th@@ ou h@@ ast sent me , and h@@ ast lov@@ ed them , as th@@ ou h@@ ast lov@@ ed me .
O righ@@ te@@ ous F@@ ather , the world hat@@ h not known the@@ e : but I have known the@@ e , and these have known that th@@ ou h@@ ast sent me .
and I have declared un@@ to them TH@@ Y name , and will declare it : that the love where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast lov@@ ed me may be in them , and I in them .
when J@@ es@@ us had spoken these words , he went forth with his dis@@ cip@@ les over the Bro@@ ok C@@ edr@@ on , where was a gar@@ den , into the which he entered , and his dis@@ cip@@ les .
as soon then as he had said un@@ to them , I am he , they went back@@ ward , and fell to the ground .
then asked he them again , whom seek ye ? and they said , J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth .
then Simon Peter having a s@@ word drew it , and smo@@ te the high pri@@ est 's ser@@ vant , and cut off his right e@@ ar . the ser@@ vant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
and led him away to Ann@@ as first ; for he was father in law to C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , which was the high pri@@ est that same year .
now C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has was he , which gave coun@@ sel to the Jews , that it was expedi@@ ent that one man should die for the people .
and Simon Peter followed J@@ es@@ us , and so did another dis@@ cip@@ le : that dis@@ cip@@ le was known un@@ to the high pri@@ est , and went in with J@@ es@@ us into the palace of the high pri@@ est .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other dis@@ cip@@ le , which was known un@@ to the high pri@@ est , and sp@@ ake un@@ to her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of co@@ als ; for it was cold : and they war@@ med themselves : and Peter stood with them , and war@@ med himself .
why ask@@ est th@@ ou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said un@@ to them : be@@ hold , they know what I said .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered him , If I have spoken ev@@ il , bear witness of the ev@@ il : but if well , why sm@@ i@@ test th@@ ou me ?
then led they J@@ es@@ us from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has un@@ to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be def@@ iled ; but that they might eat the pass@@ over .
that the saying of J@@ es@@ us might be fulfilled , which he sp@@ ake , sig@@ ni@@ fying what death he should die .
and the soldiers plat@@ ted a cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a pur@@ ple ro@@ be ,
P@@ il@@ ate therefore went forth again , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , be@@ hold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard that saying , he brought J@@ es@@ us forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pav@@ ement , but in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a .
then delivered he him therefore un@@ to them to be cru@@ ci@@ fied . and they took J@@ es@@ us , and led him away .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a s@@ kul@@ l , which is called in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w gol@@ go@@ th@@ a :
and P@@ il@@ ate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , J@@ es@@ us of NA@@ Z@@ AR@@ E@@ T@@ H the King of the Jews .
this title then read many of the Jews : for the place where J@@ es@@ us was cru@@ ci@@ fied was n@@ igh to the city : and it was written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , and Greek , and Latin .
now there stood by the cross of J@@ es@@ us his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of C@@ le@@ op@@ has , and Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore saw his mother , and the dis@@ cip@@ le standing by , whom he lov@@ ed , he sa@@ ith un@@ to his mother , W@@ oman , be@@ hold TH@@ Y son !
now there was set a ves@@ sel full of vin@@ eg@@ ar : and they filled a sp@@ un@@ ge with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it upon hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and put it to his m@@ outh .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore had received the vin@@ eg@@ ar , he said , It is finished : and he bo@@ wed his head , and gave up the gh@@ ost .
but when they came to J@@ es@@ us , and saw that he was dead already , they br@@ ake not his leg@@ s :
but one of the soldiers with a spe@@ ar pi@@ er@@ ced his side , and for@@ th@@ with came there out blood and water .
and he that saw it b@@ are record , and his record is true : and he know@@ eth that he sa@@ ith true , that ye might believe .
and there came also Nic@@ o@@ de@@ mu@@ s , which at the first came to J@@ es@@ us by night , and brought a mi@@ x@@ ture of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h and alo@@ es , about an hundred po@@ und weight .
then took they the body of J@@ es@@ us , and wo@@ und it in lin@@ en clo@@ th@@ es with the sp@@ ices , as the manner of the Jews is to bur@@ y .
now in the place where he was cru@@ ci@@ fied there was a gar@@ den ; and in the gar@@ den a new se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , where@@ in was never man yet laid .
the first day of the week co@@ me@@ th Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene early , when it was yet dark , un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and se@@ eth the stone taken away from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
so they ran both together : and the other dis@@ cip@@ le did out@@ run Peter , and came first to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and he sto@@ op@@ ing down , and looking in , saw the lin@@ en clo@@ th@@ es lying ; yet went he not in .
for as yet they knew not the s@@ crip@@ ture , that he must rise again from the dead .
but Mary stood without at the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re we@@ eping : and as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed down , and looked into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ,
and se@@ eth two an@@ gel@@ s in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of J@@ es@@ us had la@@ in .
and when she had thus said , she turned her@@ self back , and saw J@@ es@@ us standing , and knew not that it was J@@ es@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to her , Mary . she turned her@@ self , and sa@@ ith un@@ to him , R@@ ab@@ bon@@ i ; which is to say , Mas@@ ter .
and when he had so said , he she@@ wed un@@ to them his hands and his side . then were the dis@@ cip@@ les glad , when they saw the Lord .
and when he had said this , he bre@@ ath@@ ed on them , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Rece@@ ive ye the Holy gh@@ ost :
and after eight days again his dis@@ cip@@ les were within , and Thomas with them : then came J@@ es@@ us , the doors being shut , and stood in the mid@@ st , and said , Peace be un@@ to you .
then sa@@ ith he to Thomas , reach hi@@ ther TH@@ Y fin@@ ger , and be@@ hold my hands ; and reach hi@@ ther TH@@ Y hand , and th@@ rust it into my side : and be not F@@ ai@@ th@@ less , but believ@@ ing .
and many other signs truly did J@@ es@@ us in the presence of his dis@@ cip@@ les , which are not written in this book :
but when the morning was now come , J@@ es@@ us stood on the shore : but the dis@@ cip@@ les knew not that it was J@@ es@@ us .
as soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of co@@ als there , and fish laid there@@ on , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fis@@ hes , and hundred and fif@@ ty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to them , C@@ ome and dine . and none of the dis@@ cip@@ les dur@@ st ask him , Wh@@ o art th@@ ou ? kno@@ wing that it was the Lord .
this is now the third time that J@@ es@@ us she@@ wed himself to his dis@@ cip@@ les , after that he was risen from the dead .
this is the dis@@ cip@@ le which testi@@ fi@@ eth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
and there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , the which , if they should be written every one , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
to whom also he she@@ wed himself alive after his pas@@ sion by many inf@@ al@@ li@@ ble pro@@ of@@ s , being seen of them for@@ ty days , and speaking of the things per@@ taining to the k@@ ing@@ dom of God :
and , being assemb@@ led together with them , comman@@ ded them that they should not de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
when they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou at this time restore again the k@@ ing@@ dom to Israel ?
and he said un@@ to them , It is not for you to know the times or the se@@ as@@ ons , which the F@@ ather hat@@ h put in his own power .
and when he had spoken these things , while they be@@ held , he was taken up ; and a cl@@ oud received him out of their sight .
then returned they un@@ to Jer@@ usalem from the mount called Oli@@ vet , which is from Jer@@ usalem a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day 's journey .
these all continued with one accord in pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation , with the women , and Mary the mother of J@@ es@@ us , and with his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and it was known un@@ to all the d@@ wel@@ lers at Jer@@ usalem ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch as that field is called in their proper ton@@ gue , A@@ cel@@ d@@ ama , that is to say , The field of blood .
and when the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there came a sound from heav@@ en as of a rus@@ hing m@@ igh@@ ty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared un@@ to them cl@@ ov@@ en ton@@ gues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and began to speak with other ton@@ gues , as the Spiri@@ t gave them ut@@ ter@@ ance .
and there were d@@ wel@@ ling at Jer@@ usalem Jews , dev@@ out men , out of every nation under heav@@ en .
now when this was no@@ ised abroad , the multi@@ tude came together , and were con@@ founded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and on my servants and on my hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s I will p@@ our out in those days of my Spiri@@ t ; and they shall pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y :
and I will she@@ w won@@ ders in heav@@ en above , and signs in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath ; blood , and fire , and v@@ ap@@ our of smoke :
the sun shall be turned into d@@ ark@@ ness , and the moon into blood , before that great and no@@ table day of the Lord come :
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be sav@@ ed .
him , being delivered by the determin@@ ate coun@@ sel and fore@@ knowledge of God , ye have taken , and by w@@ ic@@ ked hands have cru@@ ci@@ fied and sla@@ in :
whom God hat@@ h raised up , having lo@@ os@@ ed the pain@@ s of death : because it was not possible that he should be hol@@ den of it .
for David speak@@ eth concerning him , I fore@@ saw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
because th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not leave my sou@@ l in hell , neither w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou suffer th@@ ine Holy One to see corruption .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made known to me the ways of life ; th@@ ou s@@ halt make me full of joy with TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance .
men and bre@@ th@@ ren , let me freely speak un@@ to you of the patri@@ arch David , that he is both dead and buried , and his se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re is with us un@@ to this day .
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
he seeing this before sp@@ ake of the resur@@ rec@@ tion of Ch@@ r@@ ist , that his sou@@ l was not left in hell , neither his f@@ les@@ h did see corruption .
therefore being by the right hand of God ex@@ al@@ ted , and having received of the F@@ ather the promise of the Holy gh@@ ost , he hat@@ h shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
now when they heard this , they were pri@@ cked in their heart , and said un@@ to Peter and to the rest of the A@@ post@@ les , Men and bre@@ th@@ ren , what shall we do ?
for the promise is un@@ to you , and to your children , and to all that are af@@ ar off , even as many as the Lord our God shall call .
then they that gla@@ dly received his word were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed : and the same day there were added un@@ to them about three thousand so@@ ul@@ s .
and they continued ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in the A@@ post@@ les ' doc@@ tr@@ ine and fel@@ low@@ ship , and in breaking of bread , and in pray@@ ers .
and sold their pos@@ sessions and goods , and par@@ ted them to all men , as every man had need .
now Peter and John went up together into the temp@@ le at the hour of pray@@ er , being the ninth hour .
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and an@@ cle b@@ ones received strength .
and he le@@ ap@@ ing up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temp@@ le , walk@@ ing , and le@@ ap@@ ing , and praising God .
and they knew that it was he which sat for al@@ ms at the Be@@ autiful gate of the temp@@ le : and they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at that which had happened un@@ to him .
and as the la@@ me man which was he@@ aled held Peter and John , all the people ran together un@@ to them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly won@@ dering .
but ye denied the Holy One and the J@@ ust , and desi@@ red a mur@@ der@@ er to be granted un@@ to you ;
but those things , which God before had she@@ wed by the m@@ outh of all his pro@@ ph@@ ets , that Ch@@ r@@ ist should suffer , he hat@@ h so fulfilled .
whom the heav@@ en must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hat@@ h spoken by the m@@ outh of all his hol@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ets since the world began .
for Mos@@ es truly said un@@ to the fa@@ thers , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear in all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he shall say un@@ to you .
and it shall come to pass , that every sou@@ l , which will not hear that pro@@ phe@@ t , shall be destroyed from among the people .
Ye@@ a , and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise fore@@ told of these days .
un@@ to you first God , having raised up his Son J@@ es@@ us , sent him to b@@ less you , in turning away every one of you from his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
and as they sp@@ ake un@@ to the people , the pri@@ ests , and the captain of the temp@@ le , and the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es , came upon them ,
and they laid hands on them , and put them in hold un@@ to the next day : for it was now ev@@ enti@@ de .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that their rul@@ ers , and el@@ ders , and s@@ cri@@ bes ,
and Ann@@ as the high pri@@ est , and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kin@@ d@@ red of the high pri@@ est , were gathered together at Jer@@ usalem .
then Peter , filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , said un@@ to them , Y@@ e rul@@ ers of the people , and el@@ ders of Israel ,
now when they saw the bol@@ d@@ ness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were un@@ learned and ignor@@ ant men , they mar@@ v@@ elled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with J@@ es@@ us .
but when they had comman@@ ded them to go aside out of the council , they con@@ ferred among themselves ,
saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a no@@ table mir@@ acle hat@@ h been done by them is manif@@ est to all them that d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem ; and we can@@ not deny it .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men gl@@ ori@@ fied God for that which was done .
for the man was above for@@ ty years old , on whom this mir@@ acle of he@@ aling was she@@ wed .
and being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders had said un@@ to them .
the kings of the ear@@ th stood up , and the rul@@ ers were gathered together against the Lord , and against his Ch@@ r@@ ist .
by stret@@ ching forth th@@ ine hand to he@@ al ; and that signs and won@@ ders may be done by the name of TH@@ Y hol@@ y child J@@ es@@ us .
and when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were assemb@@ led together ; and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and they sp@@ ake the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
but a certain man named An@@ an@@ ias , with Sap@@ ph@@ ira his wife , sold a possession ,
and An@@ an@@ ias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the gh@@ ost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
and the young men ar@@ ose , wo@@ und him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not kno@@ wing what was done , came in .
then fell she down stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay at his feet , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
and great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
and by the hands of the A@@ post@@ les were many signs and won@@ ders w@@ rought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon 's por@@ ch .
there came also a multi@@ tude out of the cities round about un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , bringing si@@ ck fol@@ ks , and them which were v@@ ex@@ ed with un@@ clean spir@@ its : and they were he@@ aled every one .
then the high pri@@ est rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sec@@ t of the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es , ) and were filled with in@@ dign@@ ation ,
now when the high pri@@ est and the captain of the temp@@ le and the chief pri@@ ests heard these things , they doub@@ ted of them where@@ un@@ to this would grow .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they fear@@ ed the people , lest they should have been st@@ oned .
the God of our fa@@ thers raised up J@@ es@@ us , whom ye sle@@ w and han@@ ged on a tree .
him hat@@ h God ex@@ al@@ ted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sav@@ i@@ our , for to give rep@@ ent@@ ance to Israel , and for@@ gi@@ veness of sin@@ s .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy gh@@ ost , whom God hat@@ h given to them that obe@@ y him .
when they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took coun@@ sel to s@@ lay them .
and now I say un@@ to you , refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this coun@@ sel or this work be of men , it will come to n@@ ought :
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the A@@ post@@ les , and beaten them , they comman@@ ded that they should not speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
and they depar@@ ted from the presence of the council , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing that they were counted wor@@ thy to suffer sh@@ ame for his name .
then the twelve called the multi@@ tude of the dis@@ cip@@ les un@@ to them , and said , It is not reason that we should leave the word of God , and serve tables .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , bre@@ th@@ ren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy gh@@ ost and wis@@ dom , whom we may appoint over this business .
and the word of God increased ; and the number of the dis@@ cip@@ les multi@@ p@@ lied in Jer@@ usalem greatly ; and a great company of the pri@@ ests were obe@@ di@@ ent to the faith .
then there ar@@ ose certain of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , which is called the syn@@ ago@@ gue of the Liber@@ tin@@ es , and Cy@@ ren@@ ians , and Alexand@@ ri@@ ans , and of them of Cil@@ ic@@ ia and of Asia , disp@@ ut@@ ing with Stephen .
and they were not able to res@@ ist the wis@@ dom and the spirit by which he sp@@ ake .
and they s@@ tir@@ red up the people , and the el@@ ders , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
and set up false witnesses , which said , This man ce@@ as@@ eth not to speak b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ous words against this hol@@ y place , and the law :
and all that sat in the council , looking ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an an@@ gel .
then came he out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and d@@ wel@@ t in Char@@ ran : and from th@@ ence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , where@@ in ye now d@@ well .
and God sp@@ ake on this wise , That his se@@ ed should so@@ jour@@ n in a st@@ range land ; and that they should bring them into bon@@ da@@ ge , and ent@@ re@@ at them ev@@ il four hundred years .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bon@@ da@@ ge will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
now there came a de@@ ar@@ th over all the land of Egypt and Chan@@ a@@ an , and great aff@@ li@@ ction : and our fa@@ thers found no sust@@ en@@ ance .
but when Jac@@ o@@ b heard that there was cor@@ n in Egypt , he sent out our fa@@ thers first .
and at the second time Joseph was made known to his bre@@ th@@ ren ; and Joseph 's kin@@ d@@ red was made known un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and were carried over into Sy@@ ch@@ em , and laid in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Em@@ m@@ or the father of Sy@@ ch@@ em .
but when the time of the promise drew n@@ igh , which God had sworn to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the people grew and multi@@ p@@ lied in Egypt ,
the same dealt sub@@ til@@ ly with our kin@@ d@@ red , and ev@@ il ent@@ re@@ ated our fa@@ thers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and when he was full for@@ ty years old , it came into his heart to visit his bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and av@@ en@@ ged him that was op@@ pressed , and smo@@ te the Egyptian :
for he supposed his bre@@ th@@ ren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
and the next day he she@@ wed himself un@@ to them as they stro@@ ve , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sir@@ s , ye are bre@@ th@@ ren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
then fled Mos@@ es at this saying , and was a st@@ ran@@ ger in the land of M@@ adi@@ an , where he beg@@ at two sons .
and when for@@ ty years were expired , there appeared to him in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of mount S@@ ina an an@@ gel of the Lord in a fla@@ me of fire in a b@@ ush .
then said the Lord to him , P@@ ut off TH@@ Y sho@@ es from TH@@ Y feet : for the place where th@@ ou stan@@ dest is hol@@ y ground .
I have seen , I have seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send the@@ e into Egypt .
this Mos@@ es whom they refused , saying , Wh@@ o made the@@ e a ru@@ ler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ru@@ ler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the an@@ gel which appeared to him in the b@@ ush .
he brought them out , after that he had she@@ wed won@@ ders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years .
this is that Mos@@ es , which said un@@ to the children of Israel , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear .
saying un@@ to Aaron , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds to go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
our fa@@ thers had the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , as he had appointed , speaking un@@ to Mos@@ es , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gn@@ ashed on him with their te@@ eth .
but he , being full of the Holy gh@@ ost , looked up ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly into heav@@ en , and saw the gl@@ ory of God , and J@@ es@@ us standing on the right hand of God ,
then they cri@@ ed out with a l@@ oud voice , and stopped their e@@ ars , and ran upon him with one accord ,
and cast him out of the city , and st@@ oned him : and the witnesses laid down their clo@@ th@@ es at a young man 's feet , whose name was Sa@@ ul .
and he k@@ ne@@ eled down , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice , Lord , lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this , he fell as@@ le@@ ep .
and Sa@@ ul was con@@ sent@@ ing un@@ to his death . and at that time there was a great persec@@ ution against the church which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and they were all sc@@ at@@ tered abroad throughout the regions of Ju@@ da@@ ea and Samar@@ ia , except the A@@ post@@ les .
and the people with one accord gave heed un@@ to those things which Philip sp@@ ake , hearing and seeing the mir@@ ac@@ les which he did .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its , cr@@ ying with l@@ oud voice , came out of many that were poss@@ essed with them : and many taken with pal@@ sies , and that were la@@ me , were he@@ aled .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which be@@ fore@@ time in the same city used sor@@ cer@@ y , and be@@ wit@@ ched the people of Samar@@ ia , giving out that himself was some great one :
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had be@@ wit@@ ched them with sor@@ cer@@ ies .
but when they believed Philip pre@@ aching the things concerning the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , and the name of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , both men and women .
now when the A@@ post@@ les which were at Jer@@ usalem heard that Samar@@ ia had received the word of God , they sent un@@ to them Peter and John :
who , when they were come down , pray@@ ed for them , that they might receive the Holy gh@@ ost :
( for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us . )
rep@@ ent therefore of this TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and pra@@ y God , if perhaps the thought of th@@ ine heart may be for@@ given the@@ e .
for I perce@@ ive that th@@ ou art in the g@@ all of bit@@ ter@@ ness , and in the bond of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
then answ@@ ered Simon , and said , pra@@ y ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they , when they had testified and pre@@ ached the word of the Lord , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and pre@@ ached the g@@ os@@ p@@ el in many villages of the Samar@@ it@@ ans .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Philip , saying , arise , and go toward the south un@@ to the way that go@@ eth down from Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Gaza , which is de@@ sert .
and he said , Ho@@ w can I , except some man should guide me ? and he desi@@ red Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
the place of the s@@ crip@@ ture which he read was this , He was led as a she@@ ep to the sla@@ ughter ; and like a lam@@ b dum@@ b before his s@@ hear@@ er , so opened he not his m@@ outh :
in his hum@@ iliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the ear@@ th .
and he comman@@ ded the char@@ i@@ ot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch ; and he b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed him .
and when they were come up out of the water , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caught away Philip , that the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch saw him no more : and he went on his way re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
and as he jour@@ ne@@ yed , he came near Dam@@ as@@ cus : and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ ined round about him a light from heav@@ en :
and he said , Wh@@ o art th@@ ou , Lord ? and the Lord said , I am J@@ es@@ us whom th@@ ou persec@@ u@@ test : it is hard for the@@ e to kick against the pri@@ cks .
and Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose from the ear@@ th ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and hat@@ h seen in a vision a man named An@@ an@@ ias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scal@@ es : and he received sight for@@ th@@ with , and ar@@ ose , and was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was Sa@@ ul certain days with the dis@@ cip@@ les which were at Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay he pre@@ ached Ch@@ r@@ ist in the syn@@ ago@@ gues , that he is the Son of God .
but Sa@@ ul increased the more in strength , and con@@ founded the Jews which d@@ wel@@ t at Dam@@ as@@ cus , proving that this is very Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and when Sa@@ ul was come to Jer@@ usalem , he as@@ say@@ ed to join himself to the dis@@ cip@@ les : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a dis@@ cip@@ le .
and he sp@@ ake bol@@ dly in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and disputed against the Gre@@ cians : but they went about to s@@ lay him .
which when the bre@@ th@@ ren knew , they brought him down to Ca@@ es@@ area , and sent him forth to Tar@@ sus .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the sa@@ ints which d@@ wel@@ t at Ly@@ d@@ da .
and there he found a certain man named A@@ en@@ e@@ as , which had kept his bed eight years , and was si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy .
and all that d@@ wel@@ t at Ly@@ d@@ da and Sar@@ on saw him , and turned to the Lord .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was si@@ ck , and died : whom when they had was@@ hed , they laid her in an up@@ per chamber .
and for@@ as@@ much as Ly@@ d@@ da was n@@ igh to J@@ op@@ pa , and the dis@@ cip@@ les had heard that Peter was there , they sent un@@ to him two men , desi@@ ring him that he would not delay to come to them .
and now send men to J@@ op@@ pa , and call for one Simon , whose sur@@ name is Peter :
he lo@@ d@@ get@@ h with one Simon a tan@@ ner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell the@@ e what th@@ ou ou@@ gh@@ test to do .
and when the an@@ gel which sp@@ ake un@@ to Cor@@ neli@@ us was depar@@ ted , he called two of his household servants , and a dev@@ out soldier of them that w@@ aited on him continu@@ ally ;
and when he had declared all these things un@@ to them , he sent them to J@@ op@@ pa .
on the mor@@ row , as they went on their journey , and drew n@@ igh un@@ to the city , Peter went up upon the hous@@ et@@ op to pra@@ y about the sixth hour :
and he became very hun@@ gry , and would have e@@ aten : but while they made ready , he fell into a tr@@ ance ,
and saw heav@@ en opened , and a certain ves@@ sel des@@ cen@@ ding un@@ to him , as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ ners , and let down to the ear@@ th :
W@@ her@@ e@@ in were all manner of fo@@ ur@@ fo@@ oted be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and wild be@@ asts , and cre@@ eping things , and fo@@ w@@ ls of the air .
now while Peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , be@@ hold , the men which were sent from Cor@@ neli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent un@@ to him from Cor@@ neli@@ us ; and said , be@@ hold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause where@@ fore ye are come ?
and the mor@@ row after they entered into Ca@@ es@@ area . and Cor@@ neli@@ us w@@ aited for them , and had called together his k@@ ins@@ men and near friends .
and as Peter was coming in , Cor@@ neli@@ us met him , and fell down at his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
and as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
therefore came I un@@ to you without gain@@ saying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
and Cor@@ neli@@ us said , F@@ our days ago I was fas@@ ting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I pray@@ ed in my house , and , be@@ hold , a man stood before me in bright clo@@ thing ,
and said , Cor@@ neli@@ us , TH@@ Y pray@@ er is heard , and th@@ ine al@@ ms are had in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance in the sight of God .
the word which God sent un@@ to the children of Israel , pre@@ aching peace by J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : ( he is Lord of all : )
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jer@@ usalem ; whom they sle@@ w and han@@ ged on a tree :
not to all the people , but un@@ to witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he comman@@ ded us to pre@@ ach un@@ to the people , and to testify that it is he which was or@@ da@@ ined of God to be the Judge of quick and dead .
and they of the circum@@ c@@ ision which believed were ast@@ on@@ ished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gen@@ ti@@ les also was p@@ oured out the gift of the Holy gh@@ ost .
and the A@@ post@@ les and bre@@ th@@ ren that were in Ju@@ da@@ ea heard that the Gen@@ ti@@ les had also received the word of God .
and when Peter was come up to Jer@@ usalem , they that were of the circum@@ c@@ ision conten@@ ded with him ,
but Peter re@@ hear@@ sed the matter from the beginning , and ex@@ po@@ unded it by order un@@ to them , saying ,
upon the which when I had fas@@ tened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fo@@ ur@@ fo@@ oted be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and wild be@@ asts , and cre@@ eping things , and fo@@ w@@ ls of the air .
and , be@@ hold , immediately there were three men already come un@@ to the house where I was , sent from Ca@@ es@@ area un@@ to me .
and the spirit b@@ ade me go with them , nothing doub@@ ting . moreover these six bre@@ th@@ ren accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house :
and he she@@ wed us how he had seen an an@@ gel in his house , which stood and said un@@ to him , S@@ end men to J@@ op@@ pa , and call for Simon , whose sur@@ name is Peter ;
then remember@@ ed I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with water ; but ye shall be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the Holy gh@@ ost .
For@@ as@@ much then as God gave them the like gift as he did un@@ to us , who believed on the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ; what was I , that I could with@@ stand God ?
now they which were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad upon the persec@@ ution that ar@@ ose about Stephen travelled as far as P@@ hen@@ ice , and Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , pre@@ aching the word to none but un@@ to the Jews only .
and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cy@@ ren@@ e , which , when they were come to Anti@@ o@@ ch , sp@@ ake un@@ to the Gre@@ cians , pre@@ aching the Lord J@@ es@@ us .
and the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned un@@ to the Lord .
then ti@@ dings of these things came un@@ to the e@@ ars of the church which was in Jer@@ usalem : and they sent forth Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , that he should go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch .
and there stood up one of them named Ag@@ ab@@ us , and sig@@ ni@@ fied by the spirit that there should be great de@@ ar@@ th throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Clau@@ di@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar .
then the dis@@ cip@@ les , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief un@@ to the bre@@ th@@ ren which d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ ea :
now about that time Her@@ od the king stret@@ ched forth his hands to ve@@ x certain of the church .
and he killed James the brother of John with the s@@ word .
and because he saw it pleased the Jews , he proce@@ eded further to take Peter also . ( then were the days of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . )
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; inten@@ ding after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and the an@@ gel said un@@ to him , Gir@@ d th@@ y@@ self , and bin@@ d on TH@@ Y sand@@ als . and so he did . and he sa@@ ith un@@ to him , cast TH@@ Y gar@@ ment about the@@ e , and follow me .
and he went out , and followed him ; and w@@ ist not that it was true which was done by the an@@ gel ; but thought he saw a vision .
and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose sur@@ name was Mark ; where many were gathered together pray@@ ing .
and as Peter kno@@ cked at the door of the gate , a dam@@ sel came to he@@ arken , named R@@ ho@@ da .
but Peter continued kno@@ cking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were ast@@ on@@ ished .
and when Her@@ od had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the ke@@ epers , and comman@@ ded that they should be put to death . and he went down from Ju@@ da@@ ea to Ca@@ es@@ area , and there abo@@ de .
and upon a set day Her@@ od , ar@@ ray@@ ed in royal appar@@ el , sat upon his th@@ r@@ one , and made an oration un@@ to them .
and immediately the an@@ gel of the Lord smo@@ te him , because he gave not God the gl@@ ory : and he was e@@ aten of wor@@ ms , and gave up the gh@@ ost .
and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Sa@@ ul returned from Jer@@ usalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose sur@@ name was Mark .
so they , being sent forth by the Holy gh@@ ost , depar@@ ted un@@ to S@@ ele@@ uc@@ ia ; and from th@@ ence they sa@@ iled to Cyprus .
and when they were at S@@ alam@@ is , they pre@@ ached the word of God in the syn@@ ago@@ gues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
and when they had gone through the is@@ le un@@ to Pap@@ ho@@ s , they found a certain sor@@ cer@@ er , a false pro@@ phe@@ t , a J@@ ew , whose name was Bar @@@ -@@ @ J@@ es@@ us :
then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being ast@@ on@@ ished at the doc@@ tr@@ ine of the Lord .
now when Paul and his company lo@@ os@@ ed from Pap@@ ho@@ s , they came to Per@@ ga in P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a : and John depar@@ ting from them returned to Jer@@ usalem .
but when they depar@@ ted from Per@@ ga , they came to Anti@@ o@@ ch in P@@ is@@ idi@@ a , and went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , and sat down .
and after@@ ward they desi@@ red a king : and God gave un@@ to them Sa@@ ul the son of C@@ IS , a man of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , by the space of for@@ ty years .
men and bre@@ th@@ ren , children of the stock of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever among you fear@@ eth God , to you is the word of this sal@@ vation sent .
and though they found no cause of death in him , yet desi@@ red they P@@ il@@ ate that he should be sla@@ in .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Gal@@ il@@ ee to Jer@@ usalem , who are his witnesses un@@ to the people .
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mer@@ cies of David .
for David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sle@@ ep , and was laid un@@ to his fa@@ thers , and saw corruption :
and when the Jews were gone out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , the Gen@@ ti@@ les bes@@ ought that these words might be pre@@ ached to them the next sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , they were filled with en@@ v@@ y , and sp@@ ake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contra@@ dic@@ ting and b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ing .
for so hat@@ h the Lord comman@@ ded us , saying , I have set the@@ e to be a light of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be for sal@@ vation un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and when the Gen@@ ti@@ les heard this , they were glad , and gl@@ ori@@ fied the word of the Lord : and as many as were or@@ da@@ ined to eter@@ nal life believed .
but the Jews s@@ tir@@ red up the dev@@ out and honour@@ able women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persec@@ ution against Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and expelled them out of their co@@ asts .
and it came to pass in I@@ con@@ ium , that they went both together into the syn@@ ago@@ gue of the Jews , and so sp@@ ake , that a great multi@@ tude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
but the un@@ believ@@ ing Jews s@@ tir@@ red up the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and made their min@@ ds ev@@ il affected against the bre@@ th@@ ren .
but the multi@@ tude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews , and part with the A@@ post@@ les .
and when there was an assault made both of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and also of the Jews with their rul@@ ers , to use them desp@@ ite@@ fully , and to stone them ,
they were w@@ are of it , and fled un@@ to Ly@@ str@@ a and Der@@ be , cities of Ly@@ ca@@ on@@ ia , and un@@ to the region that li@@ eth round about :
and there sat a certain man at Ly@@ str@@ a , im@@ po@@ tent in his feet , being a crip@@ ple from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , who never had walked :
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Ly@@ ca@@ on@@ ia , The go@@ ds are come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men .
and they called Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , J@@ up@@ iter ; and Paul , Mer@@ cur@@ i@@ us , because he was the chief speaker .
then the pri@@ est of J@@ up@@ iter , which was before their city , brought ox@@ en and gar@@ lands un@@ to the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
which when the A@@ post@@ les , Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Paul , heard of , they rent their clo@@ th@@ es , and ran in among the people , cr@@ ying out ,
and with these say@@ ings scar@@ ce re@@ strained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice un@@ to them .
and there came th@@ ither certain Jews from Anti@@ o@@ ch and I@@ con@@ ium , who persu@@ aded the people , and , having st@@ oned Paul , drew him out of the city , sup@@ posing he had been dead .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it , as the dis@@ cip@@ les stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he depar@@ ted with Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to Der@@ be .
and when they had or@@ da@@ ined them el@@ ders in every church , and had pray@@ ed with fas@@ ting , they commen@@ ded them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and after they had passed throughout P@@ is@@ idi@@ a , they came to P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a .
and when they had pre@@ ached the word in Per@@ ga , they went down into At@@ tal@@ ia :
and th@@ ence sa@@ iled to Anti@@ o@@ ch , from wh@@ ence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
and certain men which came down from Ju@@ da@@ ea ta@@ ught the bre@@ th@@ ren , and said , except ye be circum@@ c@@ ised after the manner of Mos@@ es , ye can@@ not be sav@@ ed .
when therefore Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as had no small dis@@ sen@@ sion and disp@@ ut@@ ation with them , they determined that Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and certain other of them , should go up to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through P@@ hen@@ ice and Samar@@ ia , declaring the con@@ version of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and they caused great joy un@@ to all the bre@@ th@@ ren .
and when they were come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received of the church , and of the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
but there rose up certain of the sec@@ t of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees which believed , saying , That it was ne@@ ed@@ ful to circum@@ c@@ ise them , and to command them to keep the law of Mos@@ es .
and the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders came together for to consider of this matter .
now therefore why temp@@ t ye God , to put a yok@@ e upon the nec@@ k of the dis@@ cip@@ les , which neither our fa@@ thers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that through the grace of the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist we shall be sav@@ ed , even as they .
that the resi@@ due of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gen@@ ti@@ les , upon whom my name is called , sa@@ ith the Lord , who do@@ eth all these things .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gen@@ ti@@ les are turned to God :
but that we write un@@ to them , that they abst@@ ain from pollu@@ tions of id@@ ols , and from for@@ nic@@ ation , and from things st@@ ran@@ g@@ led , and from blood .
For@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , sub@@ ver@@ ting your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such comman@@ d@@ ment :
so when they were dismissed , they came to Anti@@ o@@ ch : and when they had gathered the multi@@ tude together , they delivered the ep@@ ist@@ le :
Paul also and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as continued in Anti@@ o@@ ch , teaching and pre@@ aching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
and some days after Paul said un@@ to Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , Let us go again and visit our bre@@ th@@ ren in every city where we have pre@@ ached the word of the Lord , and see how they do .
but Paul thought not good to take him with them , who depar@@ ted from them from P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , and went not with them to the work .
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they depar@@ ted as@@ under one from the other : and so Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as took Mark , and sa@@ iled un@@ to Cyprus ;
then came he to Der@@ be and Ly@@ str@@ a : and , be@@ hold , a certain dis@@ cip@@ le was there , named Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , the son of a certain woman , which was a Je@@ w@@ ess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decre@@ es for to keep , that were or@@ da@@ ined of the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders which were at Jer@@ usalem .
now when they had gone throughout Ph@@ ry@@ g@@ ia and the region of Gal@@ ati@@ a , and were for@@ bid@@ den of the Holy gh@@ ost to pre@@ ach the word in Asia ,
after they were come to My@@ sia , they as@@ say@@ ed to go into Bi@@ th@@ yn@@ ia : but the Spiri@@ t suffered them not .
and after he had seen the vision , immediately we en@@ de@@ avo@@ red to go into Macedonia , assu@@ red@@ ly gathering that the Lord had called us for to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el un@@ to them .
therefore lo@@ os@@ ing from Tro@@ as , we came with a stra@@ ight course to Sam@@ o@@ th@@ rac@@ ia , and the next day to Ne@@ ap@@ ol@@ is ;
and from th@@ ence to Philip@@ pi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abi@@ ding certain days .
and on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath we went out of the city by a river side , where pray@@ er was won@@ t to be made ; and we sat down , and sp@@ ake un@@ to the women which res@@ or@@ ted th@@ ither .
the same followed Paul and us , and cri@@ ed , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which she@@ w un@@ to us the way of sal@@ vation .
and when her mas@@ ters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Sil@@ as , and drew them into the market@@ place un@@ to the rul@@ ers ,
and when they had laid many stri@@ pes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the j@@ ail@@ or to keep them saf@@ ely :
who , having received such a charge , th@@ rust them into the in@@ ner prison , and made their feet fast in the sto@@ cks .
and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were lo@@ os@@ ed .
then he called for a light , and sp@@ ran@@ g in , and came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and fell down before Paul and Sil@@ as ,
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and was@@ hed their stri@@ pes ; and was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , he and all his , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay .
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , believ@@ ing in God with all his house .
and the keep@@ er of the prison told this saying to Paul , The mag@@ istrates have sent to let you go : now therefore de@@ part , and go in peace .
and the ser@@ je@@ ants told these words un@@ to the mag@@ istrates : and they fear@@ ed , when they heard that they were Roman@@ s .
and they came and bes@@ ought them , and brought them out , and desi@@ red them to de@@ part out of the city .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Ly@@ dia and when they had seen the bre@@ th@@ ren , they comfor@@ ted them , and depar@@ ted .
now when they had passed through A@@ mp@@ hi@@ polis and A@@ pol@@ lon@@ ia , they came to Thessalon@@ ica , where was a syn@@ ago@@ gue of the Jews :
and Paul , as his manner was , went in un@@ to them , and three sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days reas@@ oned with them out of the s@@ crip@@ tures ,
opening and alleg@@ ing , that Ch@@ r@@ ist must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this J@@ es@@ us , whom I pre@@ ach un@@ to you , is Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and when they found them not , they drew J@@ ason and certain bre@@ th@@ ren un@@ to the rul@@ ers of the city , cr@@ ying , These that have turned the world U@@ p@@ side down are come hi@@ ther also ;
and they troubled the people and the rul@@ ers of the city , when they heard these things .
and when they had taken security of J@@ ason , and of the other , they let them go .
and the bre@@ th@@ ren immediately sent away Paul and Sil@@ as by night un@@ to Ber@@ ea : who coming th@@ ither went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue of the Jews .
these were more no@@ ble than those in Thessalon@@ ica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the s@@ crip@@ tures daily , whether those things were so .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honour@@ able women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
but when the Jews of Thessalon@@ ica had knowledge that the word of God was pre@@ ached of Paul at Ber@@ ea , they came th@@ ither also , and s@@ tir@@ red up the people .
and then immediately the bre@@ th@@ ren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Sil@@ as and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us abo@@ de there still .
and they that conducted Paul brought him un@@ to Athens : and receiving a comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to Sil@@ as and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us for to come to him with all speed , they depar@@ ted .
now while Paul w@@ aited for them at Athens , his spirit was s@@ tir@@ red in him , when he saw the city wh@@ ol@@ ly given to i@@ do@@ la@@ try .
therefore disputed he in the syn@@ ago@@ gue with the Jews , and with the dev@@ out persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
( for all the Ath@@ en@@ ians and st@@ ran@@ gers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
then Paul stood in the mid@@ st of Mar@@ s ' hill , and said , Y@@ e men of Athens , I perce@@ ive that in all things ye are too super@@ sti@@ tious .
for as I passed by , and be@@ held your dev@@ o@@ tions , I found an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignor@@ antly worship , him declare I un@@ to you .
God that made the world and all things there@@ in , seeing that he is Lord of heav@@ en and ear@@ th , d@@ wel@@ le@@ th not in temp@@ les made with hands ;
and hat@@ h made of one blood all nations of men for to d@@ well on all the face of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h determined the times before appointed , and the bo@@ unds of their habi@@ tation ;
that they should seek the Lord , if hap@@ ly they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his off@@ spring .
For@@ as@@ much then as we are the off@@ spring of God , we ought not to think that the God@@ head is like un@@ to gold , or silver , or stone , Gra@@ ven by art and man 's device .
because he hat@@ h appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by that man whom he hat@@ h or@@ da@@ ined ; where@@ of he hat@@ h given assur@@ ance un@@ to all men , in that he hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it certain men cla@@ ve un@@ to him , and believed : among the which was Di@@ ony@@ si@@ us the A@@ re@@ op@@ ag@@ ite , and a woman named Dam@@ ar@@ is , and others with them .
and he depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named J@@ ust@@ us , one that wor@@ shi@@ pped God , whose house joined hard to the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
and Cris@@ p@@ us , the chief ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Cor@@ in@@ th@@ ians hearing believed , and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
then sp@@ ake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision , Be not afraid , but speak , and hold not TH@@ Y peace :
and when Gal@@ li@@ o was the deputy of A@@ cha@@ ia , the Jews made insur@@ rec@@ tion with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
then all the Greeks took S@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , the chief ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gal@@ li@@ o car@@ ed for none of those things .
and he came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and left them there : but he himself entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and reas@@ oned with the Jews .
but b@@ ade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that co@@ me@@ th in Jer@@ usalem : but I will return again un@@ to you , if God will . and he sa@@ iled from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
and when he had lan@@ ded at Ca@@ es@@ area , and gone up , and sal@@ uted the church , he went down to Anti@@ o@@ ch .
and after he had spent some time there , he depar@@ ted , and went over all the country of Gal@@ ati@@ a and Ph@@ ry@@ g@@ ia in order , strengthening all the dis@@ cip@@ les .
this man was instruc@@ ted in the way of the Lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in the spirit , he sp@@ ake and ta@@ ught dil@@ ig@@ ently the things of the Lord , kno@@ wing only the b@@ ap@@ tism of John .
and he began to speak bol@@ dly in the syn@@ ago@@ gue : whom when A@@ qu@@ ila and P@@ ris@@ cil@@ la had heard , they took him un@@ to them , and ex@@ po@@ unded un@@ to him the way of God more perf@@ ec@@ tly .
and when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy gh@@ ost came on them ; and they sp@@ ake with ton@@ gues , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied .
and he went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and sp@@ ake bol@@ dly for the space of three months , disp@@ ut@@ ing and persu@@ ading the things concerning the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which d@@ wel@@ t in Asia heard the word of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , both Jews and Greeks .
so that from his body were brought un@@ to the si@@ ck hand@@ ker@@ chiefs or ap@@ r@@ ons , and the diseases depar@@ ted from them , and the ev@@ il spir@@ its went out of them .
and there were seven sons of one S@@ c@@ eva , a J@@ ew , and chief of the pri@@ ests , which did so .
and the man in whom the ev@@ il spirit was le@@ ap@@ ed on them , and over@@ came them , and prev@@ ailed against them , so that they fled out of that house nak@@ ed and wounded .
and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also d@@ wel@@ ling at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us was mag@@ ni@@ fied .
many of them also which used cur@@ ious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul pur@@ posed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , to go to Jer@@ usalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that minist@@ ered un@@ to him , Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us and Er@@ as@@ tus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
for a certain man named Demetri@@ us , a sil@@ vers@@ mit@@ h , which made silver shr@@ ines for Diana , brought no small gain un@@ to the craf@@ ts@@ men ;
and when they heard these say@@ ings , they were full of wr@@ ath , and cri@@ ed out , saying , Great is Diana of the E@@ ph@@ es@@ ians .
and the whole city was filled with conf@@ usion : and having caught G@@ ai@@ us and Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , men of Macedonia , Paul 's compan@@ ions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and when Paul would have entered in un@@ to the people , the dis@@ cip@@ les suffered him not .
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent un@@ to him , desi@@ ring him that he would not ad@@ venture himself into the theatre .
some therefore cri@@ ed one thing , and some another : for the assembly was conf@@ used ; and the more part knew not where@@ fore they were come together .
and they drew Alexander out of the multi@@ tude , the Jews putting him forward . and Alexander bec@@ kon@@ ed with the hand , and would have made his defence un@@ to the people .
for ye have brought hi@@ ther these men , which are neither rob@@ bers of churches , nor yet b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ers of your go@@ d@@ de@@ ss .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore if Demetri@@ us , and the craf@@ ts@@ men which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them imple@@ ad one another .
but if ye inqu@@ ire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a law@@ ful assembly .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's u@@ pro@@ ar , there being no cause where@@ by we may give an account of this con@@ course .
and after the u@@ pro@@ ar was ce@@ ased , Paul called un@@ to him the dis@@ cip@@ les , and embrac@@ ed them , and depar@@ ted for to go into Macedonia .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation , he came into Greece ,
and there abo@@ de three months . and when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sa@@ il into Syria , he pur@@ posed to return through Macedonia .
and we sa@@ iled away from Philip@@ pi after the days of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and came un@@ to them to Tro@@ as in five days ; where we abo@@ de seven days .
and there were many lights in the up@@ per chamber , where they were gathered together .
and Paul went down , and fell on him , and embrac@@ ing him said , Tro@@ ub@@ le not yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for his life is in him .
when he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and e@@ aten , and talked a long while , even ti@@ ll break of day , so he depar@@ ted .
and we went before to ship , and sa@@ iled un@@ to As@@ sos , there inten@@ ding to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , min@@ ding himself to go af@@ oo@@ t .
and when he met with us at As@@ sos , we took him in , and came to Mit@@ y@@ len@@ e .
and we sa@@ iled th@@ ence , and came the next day over against Chi@@ os ; and the next day we arrived at Sam@@ os , and tar@@ ried at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um ; and the next day we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he has@@ ted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jer@@ usalem the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
and when they were come to him , he said un@@ to them , Y@@ e know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all se@@ as@@ ons ,
serving the Lord with all hum@@ il@@ ity of mind , and with many te@@ ars , and temp@@ tations , which be@@ fell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable un@@ to you , but have she@@ wed you , and have ta@@ ught you public@@ k@@ ly , and from house to house ,
testi@@ fying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , rep@@ ent@@ ance toward God , and faith toward our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and now , be@@ hold , I go bound in the spirit un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , not kno@@ wing the things that shall be@@ fall me there :
and now , be@@ hold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone pre@@ aching the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , shall see my face no more .
for I have not sh@@ un@@ ned to declare un@@ to you all the coun@@ sel of God .
for I know this , that after my depar@@ ting shall gri@@ ev@@ ous w@@ ol@@ ves enter in among you , not spar@@ ing the flock .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a stra@@ ight course un@@ to Co@@ os , and the day following un@@ to R@@ ho@@ des , and from th@@ ence un@@ to Pat@@ ara :
and finding a ship sa@@ iling over un@@ to P@@ hen@@ ic@@ ia , we went abo@@ ard , and set forth .
and finding dis@@ cip@@ les , we tar@@ ried there seven days : who said to Paul through the Spiri@@ t , that he should not go up to Jer@@ usalem .
and when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
and when we had finished our course from T@@ y@@ re , we came to P@@ to@@ le@@ ma@@ is , and sal@@ uted the bre@@ th@@ ren , and abo@@ de with them one day .
and as we tar@@ ried there many days , there came down from Ju@@ da@@ ea a certain pro@@ phe@@ t , named Ag@@ ab@@ us .
and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , bes@@ ought him not to go up to Jer@@ usalem .
there went with us also certain of the dis@@ cip@@ les of Ca@@ es@@ area , and brought with them one M@@ n@@ ason of Cyprus , an old dis@@ cip@@ le , with whom we should lo@@ dge .
and when we were come to Jer@@ usalem , the bre@@ th@@ ren received us gla@@ dly .
and the day following Paul went in with us un@@ to James ; and all the el@@ ders were present .
what is it therefore ? the multi@@ tude must needs come together : for they will hear that th@@ ou art come .
do therefore this that we say to the@@ e : we have four men which have a vo@@ w on them ;
( for they had seen before with him in the city Tro@@ ph@@ im@@ us an E@@ ph@@ es@@ ian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temp@@ le . )
and all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temp@@ le : and for@@ th@@ with the doors were shut .
and as they went about to kill him , ti@@ dings came un@@ to the chief captain of the band , that all Jer@@ usalem was in an u@@ pro@@ ar .
who immediately took soldiers and centur@@ ions , and ran down un@@ to them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
and some cri@@ ed one thing , some another , among the multi@@ tude : and when he could not know the certain@@ ty for the t@@ um@@ ult , he comman@@ ded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the st@@ airs , so it was , that he was bor@@ ne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the st@@ airs , and bec@@ kon@@ ed with the hand un@@ to the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ ence , he sp@@ ake un@@ to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come n@@ igh un@@ to Dam@@ as@@ cus about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from heav@@ en a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that sp@@ ake to me .
and I said , What shall I do , Lord ? and the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , and go into Dam@@ as@@ cus ; and there it shall be told the@@ e of all things which are appointed for the@@ e to do .
and when I could not see for the gl@@ ory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and he said , The God of our fa@@ thers hat@@ h chosen the@@ e , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest know his will , and see that J@@ ust One , and sho@@ ul@@ dest hear the voice of his m@@ outh .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt be his witness un@@ to all men of what th@@ ou h@@ ast seen and heard .
and now why tar@@ ri@@ est th@@ ou ? arise , and be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , and was@@ h away TH@@ Y sin@@ s , calling on the name of the Lord .
and when the blood of TH@@ Y m@@ art@@ y@@ r Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing un@@ to his death , and kept the ra@@ im@@ ent of them that sle@@ w him .
and they gave him audience un@@ to this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the ear@@ th : for it is not fit that he should live .
and as they bound him with th@@ on@@ gs , Paul said un@@ to the centur@@ ion that stood by , Is it law@@ ful for you to s@@ cour@@ ge a man that is a Roman , and un@@ condemned ?
and the chief captain answ@@ ered , With a great sum obtained I this freedom . and Paul said , But I was free born .
then stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay they depar@@ ted from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
then said Paul , I w@@ ist not , bre@@ th@@ ren , that he was the high pri@@ est : for it is written , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not speak ev@@ il of the ru@@ ler of TH@@ Y people .
and when he had so said , there ar@@ ose a dis@@ sen@@ sion between the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es : and the multi@@ tude was divided .
and when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
then Paul called one of the centur@@ ions un@@ to him , and said , Br@@ ing this young man un@@ to the chief captain : for he hat@@ h a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prison@@ er called me un@@ to him , and pray@@ ed me to bring this young man un@@ to the@@ e , who hat@@ h something to say un@@ to the@@ e .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside priv@@ ately , and asked him , What is that th@@ ou h@@ ast to tell me ?
so the chief captain then let the young man de@@ part , and charged him , Se@@ e th@@ ou tell no man that th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed these things to me .
and provide them be@@ asts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe un@@ to F@@ eli@@ x the governor .
and he wrote a letter after this manner :
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and res@@ cu@@ ed him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause where@@ fore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
then the soldiers , as it was comman@@ ded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Anti@@ patri@@ s .
who , when they came to Ca@@ es@@ area , and delivered the ep@@ ist@@ le to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , that I be not further te@@ di@@ ous un@@ to the@@ e , I pra@@ y the@@ e that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest hear us of TH@@ Y cle@@ men@@ cy a few words .
for we have found this man a p@@ esti@@ l@@ ent fellow , and a m@@ over of se@@ di@@ tion among all the Jews throughout the world , and a r@@ ing@@ leader of the sec@@ t of the N@@ azar@@ en@@ es :
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to him to speak , answ@@ ered , For@@ as@@ much as I know that th@@ ou h@@ ast been of many years a judge un@@ to this nation , I do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
because that th@@ ou may@@ est understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jer@@ usalem for to worship .
and they neither found me in the temp@@ le disp@@ ut@@ ing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the syn@@ ago@@ gues , nor in the city :
and have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead , both of the just and un@@ just .
W@@ her@@ e@@ upon certain Jews from Asia found me pur@@ ified in the temp@@ le , neither with multi@@ tude , nor with t@@ um@@ ult .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any ev@@ il doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
except it be for this one voice , that I cri@@ ed standing among them , tou@@ ching the resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
and when F@@ eli@@ x heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he def@@ er@@ red them , and said , When Ly@@ si@@ as the chief captain shall come down , I will know the ut@@ ter@@ most of your matter .
and after certain days , when F@@ eli@@ x came with his wife Dr@@ us@@ il@@ la , which was a Je@@ w@@ ess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : where@@ fore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er , and commun@@ ed with him .
now when F@@ es@@ tus was come into the province , after three days he as@@ cen@@ ded from Ca@@ es@@ area to Jer@@ usalem .
and when he had tar@@ ried among them more than ten days , he went down un@@ to Ca@@ es@@ area ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat comman@@ ded Paul to be brought .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jer@@ usalem stood round about , and laid many and gri@@ ev@@ ous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
while he answ@@ ered for himself , Ne@@ ither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temp@@ le , nor yet against Ca@@ es@@ ar , have I off@@ ended any thing at all .
but F@@ es@@ tus , willing to do the Jews a pleas@@ ure , answ@@ ered Paul , and said , Wil@@ t th@@ ou go up to Jer@@ usalem , and there be jud@@ ged of these things before me ?
about whom , when I was at Jer@@ usalem , the chief pri@@ ests and the el@@ ders of the Jews informed me , desi@@ ring to have judgment against him .
therefore , when they were come hi@@ ther , without any delay on the mor@@ row I sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded the man to be brought forth .
and because I doub@@ ted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jer@@ usalem , and there be jud@@ ged of these matters .
for it se@@ eme@@ th to me un@@ reasonable to send a prison@@ er , and not with@@ al to sig@@ ni@@ fy the crimes laid against him .
my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jer@@ usalem , know all the Jews ;
which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most stra@@ i@@ test sec@@ t of our religion I lived a P@@ har@@ is@@ ee .
un@@ to which promise our twelve tri@@ bes , in@@ stan@@ tly serving God day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king Agri@@ p@@ pa , I am accused of the Jews .
why should it be thought a thing incre@@ di@@ ble with you , that God should raise the dead ?
I veril@@ y thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth .
which thing I also did in Jer@@ usalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at mid@@ day , O king , I saw in the way a light from heav@@ en , above the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the sun , sh@@ ining round about me and them which jour@@ ne@@ yed with me .
and I said , Wh@@ o art th@@ ou , Lord ? and he said , I am J@@ es@@ us whom th@@ ou persec@@ u@@ test .
but she@@ wed first un@@ to them of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and at Jer@@ usalem , and throughout all the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and then to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that they should rep@@ ent and turn to God , and do works meet for rep@@ ent@@ ance .
for these causes the Jews caught me in the temp@@ le , and went about to kill me .
that Ch@@ r@@ ist should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should she@@ w light un@@ to the people , and to the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
then Agri@@ p@@ pa said un@@ to Paul , Al@@ most th@@ ou persu@@ ade@@ st me to be a Christian .
and when it was determined that we should sa@@ il into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners un@@ to one named Jul@@ i@@ us , a centur@@ ion of Aug@@ ust@@ us ' band .
and entering into a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , we launched , meaning to sa@@ il by the co@@ asts of Asia ; one Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
and the next day we touched at S@@ id@@ on . and Jul@@ i@@ us cour@@ te@@ ously ent@@ re@@ ated Paul , and gave him liber@@ ty to go un@@ to his friends to ref@@ res@@ h himself .
and when we had sa@@ iled over the sea of Cil@@ ic@@ ia and P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , we came to My@@ ra , a city of Ly@@ cia .
and when we had sa@@ iled slowly many days , and scar@@ ce were come over against C@@ ni@@ du@@ s , the wind not suffering us , we sa@@ iled under Cre@@ te , over against Sal@@ m@@ one ;
and , hardly passing it , came un@@ to a place which is called The fair ha@@ ven@@ s ; n@@ igh where@@ un@@ to was the city of L@@ ase@@ a .
nevertheless the centur@@ ion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
and when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small temp@@ est lay on us , all hope that we should be sav@@ ed was then taken away .
but after long abst@@ in@@ ence Paul stood forth in the mid@@ st of them , and said , Sir@@ s , ye should have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me , and not have lo@@ os@@ ed from Cre@@ te , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I ex@@ h@@ ort you to be of good che@@ er : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , sir@@ s , be of good che@@ er : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the ship@@ men deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and so@@ unded , and found it twenty fa@@ th@@ oms : and when they had gone a little further , they so@@ unded again , and found it fif@@ teen fa@@ th@@ oms .
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon ro@@ cks , they cast four an@@ ch@@ ors out of the ster@@ n , and w@@ ished for the day .
then the soldiers cut off the ro@@ pes of the boat , and let her fall off .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I pra@@ y you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an ha@@ ir fall from the head of any of you .
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
then were they all of good che@@ er , and they also took some meat .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred thre@@ es@@ core and six@@ teen so@@ ul@@ s .
and when they had e@@ aten enough , they ligh@@ tened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ ors , they committed themselves un@@ to the sea , and lo@@ os@@ ed the ru@@ d@@ der bands , and ho@@ ised up the main@@ sa@@ il to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship ag@@ round ; and the fore@@ part st@@ uck fast , and remained un@@ mov@@ eable , but the hin@@ der part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and the soldiers ' coun@@ sel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should sw@@ im out , and escape .
and when they were escaped , then they knew that the island was called Mel@@ ita .
and the bar@@ bar@@ ous people she@@ wed us no little kin@@ d@@ ness : for they kin@@ d@@ led a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bun@@ dle of sti@@ cks , and laid them on the fire , there came a vi@@ per out of the heat , and fas@@ tened on his hand .
and when the bar@@ bar@@ ians saw the ven@@ om@@ ous be@@ ast han@@ g on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a mur@@ der@@ er , whom , though he hat@@ h escaped the sea , yet ven@@ ge@@ ance suffer@@ eth not to live .
in the same quarters were pos@@ sessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Pub@@ li@@ us ; who received us , and lo@@ d@@ ged us three days cour@@ te@@ ously .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay si@@ ck of a f@@ ever and of a blo@@ ody f@@ lu@@ x : to whom Paul entered in , and pray@@ ed , and laid his hands on him , and he@@ aled him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were he@@ aled :
who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we depar@@ ted , they la@@ ded us with such things as were necessary .
and after three months we depar@@ ted in a ship of Alexand@@ ri@@ a , which had w@@ inter@@ ed in the is@@ le , whose sign was Cas@@ tor and Pol@@ lu@@ x .
and from th@@ ence we f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass , and came to R@@ he@@ gi@@ um : and after one day the south wind ble@@ w , and we came the next day to Pu@@ te@@ ol@@ i :
where we found bre@@ th@@ ren , and were desi@@ red to tar@@ ry with them seven days : and so we went toward Rome .
and from th@@ ence , when the bre@@ th@@ ren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Ap@@ pi@@ i@@ forum , and The three ta@@ ver@@ ns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to d@@ well by himself with a soldier that kept him .
who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
but we desire to hear of the@@ e what th@@ ou thin@@ k@@ est : for as concerning this sec@@ t , we know that every where it is spoken against .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they depar@@ ted , after that Paul had spoken one word , Wel@@ l sp@@ ake the Holy gh@@ ost by E@@ sa@@ ias the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to our fa@@ thers ,
and Paul d@@ wel@@ t two whole years in his own hired house , and received all that came in un@@ to him ,
to all that be in Rome , bel@@ ov@@ ed of God , called to be sa@@ ints : grace to you and peace from God our F@@ ather , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
first , I than@@ k my God through J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
for I long to see you , that I may im@@ part un@@ to you some spir@@ itual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
that is , that I may be comfor@@ ted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
I am deb@@ tor both to the Greeks , and to the bar@@ bar@@ ians ; both to the wise , and to the un@@ wise .
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist : for it is the power of God un@@ to sal@@ vation to every one that believ@@ eth ; to the J@@ ew first , and also to the Greek .
for the wr@@ ath of God is revealed from heav@@ en against all un@@ go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess and un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of men , who hold the truth in un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
for the in@@ visible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eter@@ nal power and God@@ head ; so that they are without exc@@ use :
because that , when they knew God , they gl@@ ori@@ fied him not as God , neither were than@@ k@@ ful ; but became v@@ ain in their imag@@ inations , and their fo@@ ol@@ ish heart was dar@@ ken@@ ed .
and changed the gl@@ ory of the un@@ cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble God into an image made like to cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble man , and to birds , and fo@@ ur@@ fo@@ oted be@@ asts , and cre@@ eping things .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore God also gave them up to un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess through the lu@@ sts of their own hear@@ ts , to dis@@ honour their own bodies between themselves :
who changed the truth of God into a lie , and wor@@ shi@@ pped and served the cre@@ ature more than the Cre@@ ator , who is b@@ les@@ sed for ever . A@@ men .
for this cause God gave them up un@@ to v@@ ile aff@@ ections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not conven@@ i@@ ent ;
B@@ ack@@ bi@@ ters , hat@@ ers of God , desp@@ ite@@ ful , proud , bo@@ asters , invent@@ ors of ev@@ il things , dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to parents ,
who kno@@ wing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are wor@@ thy of death , not only do the same , but have pleas@@ ure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thin@@ k@@ est th@@ ou this , O man , that jud@@ gest them which do such things , and do@@ est the same , that th@@ ou s@@ halt escape the judgment of God ?
or desp@@ is@@ est th@@ ou the ri@@ ches of his Go@@ od@@ ness and for@@ be@@ ar@@ ance and long@@ suffering ; not kno@@ wing that the Go@@ od@@ ness of God le@@ ade@@ th the@@ e to rep@@ ent@@ ance ?
but after TH@@ Y hard@@ ness and im@@ pen@@ it@@ ent heart treas@@ u@@ rest up un@@ to th@@ y@@ self wr@@ ath against the day of wr@@ ath and reve@@ lation of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God ;
to them who by patient continu@@ ance in well doing seek for gl@@ ory and honour and im@@ mortality , eter@@ nal life :
but un@@ to them that are conten@@ tious , and do not obe@@ y the truth , but obe@@ y un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , in@@ dign@@ ation and wr@@ ath ,
for as many as have sin@@ ned without law shall also per@@ ish without law : and as many as have sin@@ ned in the law shall be jud@@ ged by the law ;
( for not the hear@@ ers of the law are just before God , but the do@@ ers of the law shall be justified .
for when the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law un@@ to themselves :
which she@@ w the work of the law written in their hear@@ ts , their con@@ science also bearing witness , and their th@@ ou@@ ghts the mean while accusing or else ex@@ cus@@ ing one another ; )
be@@ hold , th@@ ou art called a J@@ ew , and res@@ test in the law , and mak@@ est TH@@ Y bo@@ ast of God ,
and know@@ est his will , and appro@@ v@@ est the things that are more excellent , being instruc@@ ted out of the law ;
T@@ ho@@ u therefore which teach@@ est another , teach@@ est th@@ ou not th@@ y@@ self ? th@@ ou that pre@@ ach@@ est a man should not ste@@ al , dost th@@ ou ste@@ al ?
for circum@@ c@@ ision veril@@ y pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th , if th@@ ou keep the law : but if th@@ ou be a bre@@ aker of the law , TH@@ Y circum@@ c@@ ision is made un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision .
therefore if the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision keep the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the law , shall not his un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision be counted for circum@@ c@@ ision ?
and shall not un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge the@@ e , who by the letter and circum@@ c@@ ision dost trans@@ gress the law ?
for he is not a J@@ ew , which is one ou@@ tw@@ ard@@ ly ; neither is that circum@@ c@@ ision , which is ou@@ tw@@ ard in the f@@ les@@ h :
God for@@ bid : ye@@ a , let God be true , but every man a li@@ ar ; as it is written , That th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test be justified in TH@@ Y say@@ ings , and m@@ igh@@ test overcome when th@@ ou art jud@@ ged .
but if our un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness commen@@ d the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God , what shall we say ? is God un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous who tak@@ eth ven@@ ge@@ ance ? ( I speak as a man )
and not rather , ( as we be s@@ lan@@ der@@ ously reported , and as some af@@ firm that we say , ) Let us do ev@@ il , that good may come ? whose dam@@ nation is just .
they are all gone out of the way , they are together become un@@ profitable ; there is none that do@@ eth good , no , not one .
now we know that what things so@@ ever the law sa@@ ith , it sa@@ ith to them who are under the law : that every m@@ outh may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
therefore by the de@@ eds of the law there shall no f@@ les@@ h be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
even the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God which is by faith of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist un@@ to all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
what shall we say then that Ab@@ ra@@ ham our father , as per@@ taining to the f@@ les@@ h , hat@@ h found ?
now to him that wor@@ ket@@ h is the reward not rec@@ kon@@ ed of grace , but of debt .
but to him that wor@@ ket@@ h not , but believ@@ eth on him that justi@@ fi@@ eth the un@@ go@@ dly , his faith is counted for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
how was it then rec@@ kon@@ ed ? when he was in circum@@ c@@ ision , or in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision ? not in circum@@ c@@ ision , but in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision .
and the father of circum@@ c@@ ision to them who are not of the circum@@ c@@ ision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which he had being yet un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised .
for if they which are of the law be he@@ ir@@ s , faith is made vo@@ id , and the promise made of none effect :
who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations ; according to that which was spoken , S@@ o shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed be .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ a 's w@@ om@@ b :
he stag@@ gered not at the promise of God through un@@ belief ; but was strong in faith , giving gl@@ ory to God ;
and being fully persu@@ aded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imp@@ uted to him ;
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where@@ in we stand , and re@@ jo@@ ice in hope of the gl@@ ory of God .
and not only so , but we gl@@ ory in Tri@@ bula@@ tions also : kno@@ wing that tri@@ bu@@ lation wor@@ ket@@ h patience ;
and hope mak@@ eth not as@@ ha@@ med ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hear@@ ts by the Holy gh@@ ost which is given un@@ to us .
but God commen@@ de@@ th his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sin@@ ners , Ch@@ r@@ ist died for us .
for if , when we were enem@@ ies , we were reconc@@ iled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconc@@ iled , we shall be sav@@ ed by his life .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sin@@ ned :
( for until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imp@@ uted when there is no law .
nevertheless death re@@ ig@@ ned from A@@ dam to Mos@@ es , even over them that had not sin@@ ned after the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of A@@ dam 's trans@@ gres@@ sion , who is the figure of him that was to come .
and not as it was by one that sin@@ ned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condem@@ nation , but the free gift is of many offences un@@ to justi@@ fication .
therefore as by the off@@ ence of one judgment came upon all men to condem@@ nation ; even so by the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of one the free gift came upon all men un@@ to justi@@ fication of life .
know ye not , that so many of us as were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed into J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed into his death ?
therefore we are buried with him by b@@ ap@@ tism into death : that like as Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised up from the dead by the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
for if we have been plan@@ ted together in the lik@@ eness of his death , we shall be also in the lik@@ eness of his resur@@ rec@@ tion :
kno@@ wing this , that our old man is cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that hen@@ ce@@ forth we should not serve sin .
now if we be dead with Ch@@ r@@ ist , we believe that we shall also live with him :
likewise rec@@ k@@ on ye also yo@@ ur@@ selves to be dead indeed un@@ to sin , but alive un@@ to God through J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Lord .
let not sin therefore reign in your mort@@ al body , that ye should obe@@ y it in the lu@@ sts there@@ of .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to sin : but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obe@@ yed from the heart that form of doc@@ tr@@ ine which was delivered you .
being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
for when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
what fruit had ye then in those things where@@ of ye are now as@@ ha@@ med ? for the end of those things is death .
but now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit un@@ to hol@@ iness , and the end ever@@ lasting life .
for the woman which hat@@ h an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he li@@ vet@@ h ; but if the husband be dead , she is lo@@ os@@ ed from the law of her husband .
for when we were in the f@@ les@@ h , the mo@@ tions of sin@@ s , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit un@@ to death .
for that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I h@@ ate , that do I@@ .
if then I do that which I would not , I consent un@@ to the law that it is good .
now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me .
for the good that I would I do not : but the ev@@ il which I would not , that I do .
now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me .
for I de@@ light in the law of God after the in@@ ward man :
but I see another law in my members , war@@ ring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into cap@@ tivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to them which are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who walk not after the f@@ les@@ h , but after the Spiri@@ t .
for the law of the Spiri@@ t of life in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us hat@@ h made me free from the law of sin and death .
that the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the f@@ les@@ h , but after the Spiri@@ t .
for they that are after the f@@ les@@ h do mind the things of the f@@ les@@ h ; but they that are after the Spiri@@ t the things of the Spiri@@ t .
for to be car@@ n@@ ally min@@ ded is death ; but to be spir@@ itu@@ ally min@@ ded is life and peace .
because the car@@ nal mind is en@@ mity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
but ye are not in the f@@ les@@ h , but in the Spiri@@ t , if so be that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ well in you . now if any man have not the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is none of his .
and if Ch@@ r@@ ist be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spiri@@ t is life because of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him that raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ well in you , he that raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist from the dead shall also quic@@ ken your mort@@ al bodies by his Spiri@@ t that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in you .
for if ye live after the f@@ les@@ h , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spiri@@ t do mor@@ ti@@ fy the de@@ eds of the body , ye shall live .
for as many as are led by the Spiri@@ t of God , they are the sons of God .
and if children , then he@@ ir@@ s ; he@@ ir@@ s of God , and joint @@@ -@@ @ he@@ ir@@ s with Ch@@ r@@ ist ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also gl@@ ori@@ fied together .
for I rec@@ k@@ on that the suffer@@ ings of this present time are not wor@@ thy to be compared with the gl@@ ory which shall be revealed in us .
for the ear@@ n@@ est expec@@ tation of the cre@@ ature w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the manif@@ est@@ ation of the sons of God .
for we are sav@@ ed by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man se@@ eth , why do@@ th he yet hope for ?
but if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
likewise the Spiri@@ t also hel@@ pet@@ h our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities : for we know not what we should pra@@ y for as we ought : but the Spiri@@ t itself mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can@@ not be ut@@ tered .
and he that sear@@ ch@@ eth the hear@@ ts know@@ eth what is the mind of the Spiri@@ t , because he mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for the sa@@ ints according to the will of God .
and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
for whom he did fo@@ rek@@ now , he also did pre@@ dest@@ in@@ ate to be con@@ formed to the image of his Son , that he might be the fir@@ st@@ born among many bre@@ th@@ ren .
moreover whom he did pre@@ dest@@ in@@ ate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
what shall we then say to these things ? if God be for us , who can be against us ?
he that spar@@ ed not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
who shall lay any thing to the charge of God 's elect ? it is God that justi@@ fi@@ eth .
who is he that condem@@ net@@ h ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist that died , ye@@ a rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
as it is written , For TH@@ Y sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter .
N@@ ay , in all these things we are more than conqu@@ er@@ ors through him that lov@@ ed us .
not as though the word of God hat@@ h taken none effect . for they are not all Israel , which are of Israel :
that is , They which are the children of the f@@ les@@ h , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the se@@ ed .
and not only this ; but when Re@@ bec@@ ca also had conce@@ ived by one , even by our father I@@ sa@@ ac ;
for he sa@@ ith to Mos@@ es , I will have mer@@ cy on whom I will have mer@@ cy , and I will have comp@@ as@@ sion on whom I will have comp@@ as@@ sion .
so then it is not of him that w@@ il@@ le@@ th , nor of him that run@@ net@@ h , but of God that she@@ w@@ eth mer@@ cy .
what if God , willing to she@@ w his wr@@ ath , and to make his power known , en@@ du@@ red with much long@@ suffering the vessels of wr@@ ath f@@ it@@ ted to destruction :
and that he might make known the ri@@ ches of his gl@@ ory on the vessels of mer@@ cy , which he had a@@ fore prepared un@@ to gl@@ ory ,
even us , whom he hat@@ h called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gen@@ ti@@ les ?
as he sa@@ ith also in O@@ see , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her bel@@ ov@@ ed , which was not bel@@ ov@@ ed .
for he will finish the work , and cut it short in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the ear@@ th .
what shall we say then ? that the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which followed not after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , have at@@ tained to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , even the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness which is of faith .
but Israel , which followed after the law of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , hat@@ h not at@@ tained to the law of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stumb@@ led at that stumb@@ l@@ ing@@ stone ;
Bre@@ th@@ ren , my heart 's desire and pray@@ er to God for Israel is , that they might be sav@@ ed .
for they being ignor@@ ant of God 's righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and going about to establish their own righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , have not submitted themselves un@@ to the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God .
that if th@@ ou s@@ halt conf@@ ess with TH@@ Y m@@ outh the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and s@@ halt believe in th@@ ine heart that God hat@@ h raised him from the dead , th@@ ou s@@ halt be sav@@ ed .
for with the heart man believ@@ eth un@@ to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; and with the m@@ outh conf@@ ession is made un@@ to sal@@ vation .
for there is no difference between the J@@ ew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich un@@ to all that call upon him .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a pre@@ acher ?
and how shall they pre@@ ach , except they be sent ? as it is written , Ho@@ w beautiful are the feet of them that pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of peace , and bring glad ti@@ dings of good things !
but I say , H@@ ave they not heard ? yes veril@@ y , their sound went into all the ear@@ th , and their words un@@ to the ends of the world .
but I say , did not Israel know ? first Mos@@ es sa@@ ith , I will prov@@ oke you to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y by them that are no people , and by a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation I will an@@ ger you .
but E@@ sa@@ ias is very b@@ old , and sa@@ ith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manif@@ est un@@ to them that asked not after me .
I say then , H@@ ath God cast away his people ? God for@@ bid . for I also am an Isra@@ elite , of the se@@ ed of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , of the tri@@ be of Benjamin .
God hat@@ h not cast away his people which he fo@@ rek@@ new . W@@ ot ye not what the s@@ crip@@ ture sa@@ ith of Eli@@ as ? how he mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession to God against Israel , saying ,
but what sa@@ ith the answer of God un@@ to him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bo@@ wed the k@@ ne@@ e to the image of Ba@@ al .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
what then ? Israel hat@@ h not obtained that which he seek@@ eth for ; but the election hat@@ h obtained it , and the rest were b@@ lin@@ ded
and David sa@@ ith , Let their table be made a sn@@ are , and a tra@@ p , and a stumbling block , and a re@@ comp@@ ence un@@ to them :
let their eyes be dar@@ ken@@ ed , that they may not see , and bo@@ w down their back al@@ way .
now if the fall of them be the ri@@ ches of the world , and the dimin@@ ishing of them the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les ; how much more their ful@@ ness ?
for I speak to you Gen@@ ti@@ les , in@@ as@@ much as I am the A@@ pos@@ tle of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , I mag@@ ni@@ fy mine office :
if by any means I may prov@@ oke to em@@ ulation them which are my f@@ les@@ h , and might save some of them .
for if the casting away of them be the reconc@@ iling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
for if the fir@@ st@@ fruit be hol@@ y , the lum@@ p is also hol@@ y : and if the root be hol@@ y , so are the branches .
well ; because of un@@ belief they were broken off , and th@@ ou stan@@ dest by faith . be not high@@ min@@ ded , but fear :
for if God spar@@ ed not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spar@@ e not the@@ e .
be@@ hold therefore the Go@@ od@@ ness and sever@@ ity of God : on them which fell , sever@@ ity ; but toward the@@ e , Go@@ od@@ ness , if th@@ ou continue in his Go@@ od@@ ness : otherwise th@@ ou also s@@ halt be cut off .
and they also , if they abide not still in un@@ belief , shall be gra@@ ff@@ ed in : for God is able to gra@@ ff them in again .
and so all Israel shall be sav@@ ed : as it is written , There shall come out of S@@ ion the D@@ eli@@ ver@@ er , and shall turn away un@@ go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess from Jac@@ o@@ b :
as concerning the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , they are enem@@ ies for your sak@@ es : but as tou@@ ching the election , they are bel@@ ov@@ ed for the fa@@ thers ' sak@@ es .
for as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mer@@ cy through their un@@ belief :
I bes@@ e@@ ech you therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , by the mer@@ cies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , hol@@ y , acceptable un@@ to God , which is your reasonable service .
and be not con@@ formed to this world : but be ye transformed by the rene@@ wing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
for as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , let us pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y according to the pro@@ portion of faith ;
or ministry , let us wait on our minist@@ ering : or he that teach@@ eth , on teaching ;
or he that ex@@ hor@@ te@@ th , on ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation : he that gi@@ vet@@ h , let him do it with simp@@ lic@@ ity ; he that ru@@ le@@ th , with dil@@ ig@@ ence ; he that she@@ w@@ eth mer@@ cy , with che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness .
let love be without dis@@ si@@ mu@@ lation . Ab@@ h@@ or that which is ev@@ il ; cle@@ ave to that which is good .
re@@ jo@@ ice with them that do re@@ jo@@ ice , and we@@ ep with them that we@@ ep .
be of the same mind one toward another . mind not high things , but con@@ des@@ cen@@ d to men of low estate . be not wise in your own conce@@ its .
if it be possible , as much as li@@ eth in you , live peac@@ e@@ ably with all men .
therefore if th@@ ine enemy hunger , fe@@ ed him ; if he thir@@ st , give him drink : for in so doing th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head .
let every sou@@ l be subject un@@ to the higher powers . for there is no power but of God : the powers that be are or@@ da@@ ined of God .
for for this cause pay ye tri@@ bute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continu@@ ally upon this very thing .
the night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of d@@ ark@@ ness , and let us put on the arm@@ our of light .
but put ye on the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make not provision for the f@@ les@@ h , to fulfil the lu@@ sts there@@ of .
for one believ@@ eth that he may eat all things : another , who is weak , e@@ ate@@ th her@@ bs .
let not him that e@@ ate@@ th desp@@ ise him that e@@ ate@@ th not ; and let not him which e@@ ate@@ th not judge him that e@@ ate@@ th : for God hat@@ h received him .
for whether we live , we live un@@ to the Lord ; and whether we die , we die un@@ to the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Ch@@ r@@ ist both died , and rose , and revi@@ ved , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
but why dost th@@ ou judge TH@@ Y brother ? or why dost th@@ ou set at n@@ ought TH@@ Y brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumb@@ l@@ ing@@ block or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persu@@ aded by the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that es@@ te@@ eme@@ th any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
but if TH@@ Y brother be gri@@ ev@@ ed with TH@@ Y meat , now walk@@ est th@@ ou not char@@ it@@ ably . destroy not him with TH@@ Y meat , for whom Ch@@ r@@ ist died .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is not meat and drink ; but righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and peace , and joy in the Holy gh@@ ost .
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things where@@ with one may edi@@ fy another .
for meat destroy not the work of God . all things indeed are p@@ ure ; but it is ev@@ il for that man who e@@ ate@@ th with off@@ ence .
it is good neither to eat f@@ les@@ h , nor to drink wine , nor any thing where@@ by TH@@ Y brother stumb@@ le@@ th , or is off@@ ended , or is made weak .
H@@ ast th@@ ou faith ? have it to th@@ y@@ self before God . happy is he that condem@@ net@@ h not himself in that thing which he allow@@ eth .
and he that doub@@ te@@ th is dam@@ ned if he eat , because he e@@ ate@@ th not of faith : for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is not of faith is sin .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things were written af@@ ore@@ time were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfor@@ t of the s@@ crip@@ tures might have hope .
and again , E@@ sa@@ ias sa@@ ith , There shall be a root of J@@ es@@ se , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gen@@ ti@@ les ; in him shall the Gen@@ ti@@ les trust .
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believ@@ ing , that ye may ab@@ ound in hope , through the power of the Holy gh@@ ost .
and I myself also am persu@@ aded of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye also are full of Go@@ od@@ ness , filled with all knowledge , able also to ad@@ mon@@ ish one another .
nevertheless , bre@@ th@@ ren , I have written the more bol@@ dly un@@ to you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
Ye@@ a , so have I stri@@ ved to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , not where Ch@@ r@@ ist was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
but as it is written , To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand .
for it hat@@ h pleased them of Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia to make a certain contribution for the poor sa@@ ints which are at Jer@@ usalem .
it hat@@ h pleased them veril@@ y ; and their deb@@ tors they are . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , their duty is also to minister un@@ to them in car@@ nal things .
when therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
and I am sure that , when I come un@@ to you , I shall come in the ful@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , for the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake , and for the love of the Spiri@@ t , that ye strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ;
that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Ju@@ da@@ ea ; and that my service which I have for Jer@@ usalem may be accepted of the sa@@ ints ;
that I may come un@@ to you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be ref@@ res@@ hed .
I commen@@ d un@@ to you P@@ he@@ be our sister , which is a ser@@ vant of the church which is at Cen@@ ch@@ rea :
who have for my life laid down their own nec@@ ks : un@@ to whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
sal@@ ute An@@ dr@@ on@@ ic@@ us and Jun@@ ia , my k@@ ins@@ men , and my fel@@ low@@ prisoners , who are of note among the A@@ post@@ les , who also were in Ch@@ r@@ ist before me .
sal@@ ute Her@@ odi@@ on my k@@ ins@@ man . gre@@ et them that be of the household of N@@ ar@@ c@@ issu@@ s , which are in the Lord .
sal@@ ute Phil@@ olo@@ gu@@ s , and Jul@@ ia , Ner@@ e@@ us , and his sister , and Olymp@@ as , and all the sa@@ ints which are with them .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doc@@ tr@@ ine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
for they that are such serve not our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but their own bel@@ ly ; and by good words and fair spe@@ eches dec@@ e@@ ive the hear@@ ts of the simple .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence is come abroad un@@ to all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise un@@ to that which is good , and simple concerning ev@@ il .
and the God of peace shall bru@@ ise S@@ atan under your feet shortly . the grace of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist be with you . A@@ men .
Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us my work@@ fellow , and Lu@@ ci@@ us , and J@@ ason , and S@@ os@@ ip@@ ater , my k@@ ins@@ men , sal@@ ute you .
but now is made manif@@ est , and by the s@@ crip@@ tures of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the ever@@ lasting God , made known to all nations for the obe@@ di@@ ence of faith :
I than@@ k my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
who shall also confirm you un@@ to the end , that ye may be bla@@ me@@ less in the day of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
God is fa@@ ith@@ ful , by whom ye were called un@@ to the fel@@ low@@ ship of his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Lord .
for it hat@@ h been declared un@@ to me of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , by them which are of the house of Ch@@ lo@@ e , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for Ch@@ r@@ ist sent me not to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze , but to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el : not with wis@@ dom of words , lest the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist should be made of none effect .
for the pre@@ aching of the cross is to them that per@@ ish fo@@ ol@@ ishness ; but un@@ to us which are sav@@ ed it is the power of God .
for it is written , I will destroy the wis@@ dom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the pru@@ dent .
where is the wise ? where is the s@@ cri@@ be ? where is the dispu@@ ter of this world ? hat@@ h not God made fo@@ ol@@ ish the wis@@ dom of this world ?
for after that in the wis@@ dom of God the world by wis@@ dom knew not God , it pleased God by the fo@@ ol@@ ishness of pre@@ aching to save them that believe .
but un@@ to them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Ch@@ r@@ ist the power of God , and the wis@@ dom of God .
for ye see your calling , bre@@ th@@ ren , how that not many wise men after the f@@ les@@ h , not many m@@ igh@@ ty , not many no@@ ble , are called :
but God hat@@ h chosen the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world to con@@ found the wise ; and God hat@@ h chosen the weak things of the world to con@@ found the things which are m@@ igh@@ ty ;
and base things of the world , and things which are desp@@ ised , hat@@ h God chosen , ye@@ a , and things which are not , to bring to n@@ ought things that are :
but of him are ye in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who of God is made un@@ to us wis@@ dom , and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and sanc@@ ti@@ fication , and re@@ dem@@ ption :
and I , bre@@ th@@ ren , when I came to you , came not with exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of speech or of wis@@ dom , declaring un@@ to you the testimony of God .
and I was with you in weak@@ ness , and in fear , and in much tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
and my speech and my pre@@ aching was not with en@@ tic@@ ing words of man 's wis@@ dom , but in demonstration of the Spiri@@ t and of power :
that your faith should not stand in the wis@@ dom of men , but in the power of God .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it we speak wis@@ dom among them that are perfect : yet not the wis@@ dom of this world , nor of the pr@@ inces of this world , that come to n@@ ought :
but God hat@@ h revealed them un@@ to us by his Spiri@@ t : for the Spiri@@ t sear@@ ch@@ eth all things , ye@@ a , the deep things of God .
for what man know@@ eth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God know@@ eth no man , but the Spiri@@ t of God .
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wis@@ dom teach@@ eth , but which the Holy gh@@ ost teach@@ eth ; compar@@ ing spir@@ itual things with spir@@ itual .
but the natural man recei@@ vet@@ h not the things of the Spiri@@ t of God : for they are fo@@ ol@@ ishness un@@ to him : neither can he know them , because they are spir@@ itu@@ ally dis@@ cer@@ ned .
I have f@@ ed you with milk , and not with meat : for hi@@ ther@@ to ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
for ye are yet car@@ nal : for whereas there is among you en@@ v@@ ying , and stri@@ fe , and divisions , are ye not car@@ nal , and walk as men ?
who then is Paul , and who is A@@ pol@@ los , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
so then neither is he that plan@@ te@@ th any thing , neither he that water@@ eth ; but God that gi@@ vet@@ h the increase .
now he that plan@@ te@@ th and he that water@@ eth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
for we are la@@ bour@@ ers together with God : ye are God 's hus@@ b@@ and@@ ry , ye are God 's building .
every man 's work shall be made manif@@ est : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
if any man 's work abide which he hat@@ h built there@@ upon , he shall receive a reward .
if any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be sav@@ ed ; yet so as by fire .
know ye not that ye are the temp@@ le of God , and that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in you ?
if any man def@@ ile the temp@@ le of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temp@@ le of God is hol@@ y , which temp@@ le ye are .
let no man dec@@ e@@ ive himself . if any man among you se@@ eme@@ th to be wise in this world , let him become a fo@@ ol , that he may be wise .
whether Paul , or A@@ pol@@ los , or C@@ ep@@ has , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yo@@ urs ;
let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and ste@@ wards of the my@@ ster@@ ies of God .
moreover it is required in ste@@ wards , that a man be found fa@@ ith@@ ful .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged of you , or of man 's judgment : ye@@ a , I judge not mine own self .
for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not her@@ e@@ by justified : but he that jud@@ get@@ h me is the Lord .
for who mak@@ eth the@@ e to differ from another ? and what h@@ ast th@@ ou that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not receive ? now if th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st receive it , why dost th@@ ou gl@@ ory , as if th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st not received it ?
now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have re@@ ig@@ ned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
we are fo@@ ols for Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake , but ye are wise in Ch@@ r@@ ist ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honour@@ able , but we are desp@@ ised .
even un@@ to this present hour we both hunger , and thir@@ st , and are nak@@ ed , and are bu@@ ffe@@ ted , and have no certain d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ place ;
and labour , working with our own hands : being re@@ vil@@ ed , we b@@ less ; being persec@@ uted , we suffer it :
being de@@ fa@@ med , we in@@ treat : we are made as the Fil@@ th of the world , and are the off@@ s@@ cour@@ ing of all things un@@ to this day .
for though ye have ten thousand instruc@@ tors in Ch@@ r@@ ist , yet have ye not many fa@@ thers : for in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us I have be@@ gotten you through the g@@ os@@ p@@ el .
now some are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , as though I would not come to you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , but the power .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is not in word , but in power .
what will ye ? shall I come un@@ to you with a ro@@ d , or in love , and in the spirit of me@@ ek@@ ness ?
it is reported com@@ mon@@ ly that there is for@@ nic@@ ation among you , and such for@@ nic@@ ation as is not so much as named among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that one should have his father 's wife .
and ye are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , and have not rather mour@@ ned , that he that hat@@ h done this de@@ ed might be taken away from among you .
your g@@ lor@@ ying is not good . know ye not that a little le@@ av@@ en le@@ av@@ en@@ eth the whole lum@@ p ?
pur@@ ge out therefore the old le@@ av@@ en , that ye may be a new lum@@ p , as ye are un@@ le@@ av@@ ened . for even Ch@@ r@@ ist our pass@@ over is sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for us :
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old le@@ av@@ en , neither with the le@@ av@@ en of mal@@ ice and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; but with the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of sinc@@ erity and truth .
yet not altogether with the for@@ nic@@ ators of this world , or with the c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous , or ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , or with i@@ do@@ la@@ ters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the sa@@ ints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be jud@@ ged by you , are ye un@@ wor@@ thy to judge the smal@@ lest matters ?
know ye not that we shall judge an@@ gel@@ s ? how much more things that per@@ tain to this life ?
if then ye have judg@@ ments of things per@@ taining to this life , set them to judge who are least es@@ te@@ emed in the church .
and such were some of you : but ye are was@@ hed , but ye are sanc@@ ti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and by the Spiri@@ t of our God .
and God hat@@ h both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
know ye not that your bodies are the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them the members of an har@@ lot ? God for@@ bid .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an har@@ lot is one body ? for two , sa@@ ith he , shall be one f@@ les@@ h .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temp@@ le of the Holy gh@@ ost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
for ye are bought with a price : therefore g@@ lor@@ ify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
now concerning the things where@@ of ye wrote un@@ to me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
nevertheless , to avoid for@@ nic@@ ation , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
let the husband ren@@ der un@@ to the wife due ben@@ evol@@ ence : and likewise also the wife un@@ to the husband .
the wife hat@@ h not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hat@@ h not power of his own body , but the wife .
Def@@ ra@@ ud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er ; and come together again , that S@@ atan temp@@ t you not for your in@@ contin@@ ency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hat@@ h his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
but if they can@@ not contain , let them mar@@ ry : for it is better to mar@@ ry than to bur@@ n .
and un@@ to the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife de@@ part from her husband :
but and if she de@@ part , let her remain un@@ married , or be reconc@@ iled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hat@@ h a wife that believ@@ eth not , and she be pleased to d@@ well with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hat@@ h an husband that believ@@ eth not , and if he be pleased to d@@ well with her , let her not leave him .
for the un@@ believ@@ ing husband is sanc@@ ti@@ fied by the wife , and the un@@ believ@@ ing wife is sanc@@ ti@@ fied by the husband : else were your children un@@ clean ; but now are they hol@@ y .
but if the un@@ believ@@ ing de@@ part , let him de@@ part . a brother or a sister is not under bon@@ da@@ ge in such cases : but God hat@@ h called us to peace .
for what know@@ est th@@ ou , O wife , whether th@@ ou s@@ halt save TH@@ Y husband ? or how know@@ est th@@ ou , O man , whether th@@ ou s@@ halt save TH@@ Y wife ?
but as God hat@@ h distributed to every man , as the Lord hat@@ h called every one , so let him walk . and so or@@ da@@ in I in all churches .
is any man called being circum@@ c@@ ised ? let him not become un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised . is any called in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision ? let him not be circum@@ c@@ ised .
art th@@ ou called being a ser@@ vant ? care not for it : but if th@@ ou may@@ est be made free , use it rather .
for he that is called in the Lord , being a ser@@ vant , is the Lord 's Fre@@ eman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's ser@@ vant .
now concerning vir@@ g@@ ins I have no comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hat@@ h obtained mer@@ cy of the Lord to be fa@@ ith@@ ful .
I sup@@ pose therefore that this is good for the present dist@@ ress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
art th@@ ou bound un@@ to a wife ? seek not to be lo@@ os@@ ed . art th@@ ou lo@@ os@@ ed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but I would have you without car@@ eful@@ ness . he that is un@@ married c@@ aret@@ h for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may ple@@ ase the Lord :
but he that is married c@@ aret@@ h for the things that are of the world , how he may ple@@ ase his wife .
but if any man think that he beha@@ vet@@ h himself un@@ co@@ mely toward his vir@@ gin , if she pass the f@@ lower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sin@@ net@@ h not : let them mar@@ ry .
nevertheless he that stan@@ de@@ th ste@@ d@@ fast in his heart , having no necess@@ ity , but hat@@ h power over his own will , and hat@@ h so decre@@ ed in his heart that he will keep his vir@@ gin , do@@ eth well .
so then he that gi@@ vet@@ h her in marriage do@@ eth well ; but he that gi@@ vet@@ h her not in marriage do@@ eth better .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband li@@ vet@@ h ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liber@@ ty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
and if any man think that he know@@ eth anything , he know@@ eth nothing yet as he ought to know .
but if any man love God , the same is known of him .
as concerning therefore the e@@ ating of those things that are offered in sacrifice un@@ to id@@ ols , we know that an i@@ dol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with con@@ science of the i@@ dol un@@ to this hour eat it as a thing offered un@@ to an i@@ dol ; and their con@@ science being weak is def@@ iled .
but meat commen@@ de@@ th us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but take heed lest by any means this liber@@ ty of yo@@ urs become a stumb@@ l@@ ing@@ block to them that are weak .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , if meat make my brother to off@@ end , I will eat no f@@ les@@ h while the world stan@@ de@@ th , lest I make my brother to off@@ end .
am I not an A@@ pos@@ tle ? am I not free ? have I not seen J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Lord ? are not ye my work in the Lord ?
if I be not an A@@ pos@@ tle un@@ to others , yet doub@@ t@@ less I am to you : for the se@@ al of mine ap@@ ost@@ le@@ ship are ye in the Lord .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other A@@ post@@ les , and as the bre@@ th@@ ren of the Lord , and C@@ ep@@ has ?
if we have so@@ wn un@@ to you spir@@ itual things , is it a great thing if we shall re@@ ap your car@@ nal things ?
do ye not know that they which minister about hol@@ y things live of the things of the temp@@ le ? and they which wait at the al@@ ter are par@@ tak@@ ers with the al@@ ter ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done un@@ to me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my g@@ lor@@ ying vo@@ id .
for if I do this thing will@@ ingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ation of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el is committed un@@ to me .
what is my reward then ? Ver@@ ily that , when I pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , I may make the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , that I abuse not my power in the g@@ os@@ p@@ el .
for though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself ser@@ vant un@@ to all , that I might gain the more .
and un@@ to the Jews I became as a J@@ ew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Ch@@ r@@ ist , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
and this I do for the g@@ os@@ p@@ el 's sake , that I might be par@@ tak@@ er there@@ of with you .
know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one recei@@ vet@@ h the prize ? so run , that ye may obtain .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subj@@ ection : lest that by any means , when I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be a cas@@ ta@@ way .
and did all drink the same spir@@ itual drink : for they d@@ rank of that spir@@ itual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not l@@ ust after ev@@ il things , as they also lus@@ ted .
neither be ye i@@ do@@ la@@ ters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
neither let us commit for@@ nic@@ ation , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
neither let us temp@@ t Ch@@ r@@ ist , as some of them also temp@@ ted , and were destroyed of Ser@@ pen@@ ts .
now all these things happened un@@ to them for en@@ samples : and they are written for our ad@@ mon@@ ition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is it not the commun@@ ion of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is it not the commun@@ ion of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
be@@ hold Israel after the f@@ les@@ h : are not they which eat of the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es par@@ tak@@ ers of the al@@ ter ?
but I say , that the things which the Gen@@ ti@@ les sacrifice , they sacrifice to dev@@ ils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fel@@ low@@ ship with dev@@ ils .
Y@@ e can@@ not drink the c@@ up of the Lord , and the c@@ up of dev@@ ils : ye can@@ not be par@@ tak@@ ers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of dev@@ ils .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be dis@@ posed to go ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is set before you , eat , asking no question for con@@ science sake .
but if any man say un@@ to you , This is offered in sacrifice un@@ to id@@ ols , eat not for his sake that she@@ wed it , and for con@@ science sake : for the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of :
con@@ science , I say , not th@@ ine own , but of the other : for why is my liber@@ ty jud@@ ged of another man 's con@@ science ?
for if I by grace be a par@@ tak@@ er , why am I ev@@ il spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
give none off@@ ence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , nor to the church of God :
even as I ple@@ ase all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be sav@@ ed .
now I praise you , bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ord@@ inan@@ ces , as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know , that the head of every man is Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Ch@@ r@@ ist is God .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , for@@ as@@ much as he is the image and gl@@ ory of God : but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
for the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the an@@ gel@@ s .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
for as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of go@@ d .
now in this that I declare un@@ to you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
for there must be also her@@ es@@ ies among you , that they which are approved may be made manif@@ est among you .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's Sup@@ per .
for in e@@ ating every one tak@@ eth before other his own Sup@@ per : and one is hun@@ gry , and another is dr@@ un@@ ken .
for as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this c@@ up , ye do she@@ w the Lord 's death ti@@ ll he come .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall eat this bread , and drink this c@@ up of the Lord , un@@ wor@@ th@@ ily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that c@@ up .
for he that e@@ ate@@ th and drin@@ ket@@ h un@@ wor@@ th@@ ily , e@@ ate@@ th and drin@@ ket@@ h dam@@ nation to himself , not dis@@ cer@@ ning the Lord 's body .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be jud@@ ged .
but when we are jud@@ ged , we are ch@@ as@@ tened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , my bre@@ th@@ ren , when ye come together to eat , tar@@ ry one for another .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together un@@ to condem@@ nation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
Y@@ e know that ye were Gen@@ ti@@ les , carried away un@@ to these dum@@ b id@@ ols , even as ye were led .
and there are di@@ versities of operations , but it is the same God which wor@@ ket@@ h all in all .
for as the body is one , and hat@@ h many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Ch@@ r@@ ist .
if the fo@@ ot shall say , Bec@@ ause I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
and if the e@@ ar shall say , Bec@@ ause I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the s@@ mel@@ ling ?
but now hat@@ h God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hat@@ h pleased him .
N@@ ay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more fe@@ e@@ ble , are necessary :
for our co@@ mely parts have no need : but God hat@@ h temper@@ ed the body together , having given more ab@@ und@@ ant honour to that part which la@@ cked :
that there should be no Sch@@ ism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
and whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members re@@ jo@@ ice with it .
though I speak with the ton@@ gues of men and of an@@ gel@@ s , and have not charity , I am become as so@@ unding br@@ ass , or a tin@@ k@@ ling cy@@ m@@ bal .
and though I bes@@ to@@ w all my goods to fe@@ ed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th me nothing .
charity suffer@@ eth long , and is kind ; charity en@@ vi@@ eth not ; charity va@@ un@@ te@@ th not itself , is not pu@@ ff@@ ed up ,
charity never fail@@ eth : but whether there be pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies , they shall fail ; whether there be ton@@ gues , they shall ce@@ ase ; whether there be knowledge , it shall van@@ ish away .
but when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
when I was a child , I sp@@ ake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
for now we see through a glass , d@@ ark@@ ly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; but then shall I know even as also I am known .
for he that speak@@ eth in an unknown ton@@ gue speak@@ eth not un@@ to men , but un@@ to God : for no man under@@ stan@@ de@@ th him ; ho@@ w@@ be@@ it in the spirit he speak@@ eth my@@ ster@@ ies .
and even things without life giving sound , whether pip@@ e or har@@ p , except they give a distinc@@ tion in the so@@ unds , how shall it be known what is pip@@ ed or har@@ ped ?
for if the tr@@ ump@@ et give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
so likewise ye , except ye ut@@ ter by the ton@@ gue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signific@@ ation .
therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be un@@ to him that speak@@ eth a bar@@ bar@@ ian , and he that speak@@ eth shall be a bar@@ bar@@ ian un@@ to me .
even so ye , for@@ as@@ much as ye are z@@ e@@ al@@ ous of spir@@ itual gifts , seek that ye may exc@@ el to the edi@@ fying of the church .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
else when th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ less with the spirit , how shall he that occup@@ i@@ eth the room of the un@@ learned say A@@ men at TH@@ Y giving of thanks , seeing he under@@ stan@@ de@@ th not what th@@ ou say@@ est ?
I than@@ k my God , I speak with ton@@ gues more than ye all :
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might te@@ ach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown ton@@ gue .
in the law it is written , With men of other ton@@ gues and other li@@ ps will I speak un@@ to this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ton@@ gues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying ser@@ vet@@ h not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with ton@@ gues , and there come in those that are un@@ learned , or un@@ beli@@ ever@@ s , will they not say that ye are ma@@ d ?
and thus are the secre@@ ts of his heart made manif@@ est ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
if any man speak in an unknown ton@@ gue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpre@@ t .
but if there be no interpre@@ ter , let him keep sil@@ ence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
if any thing be revealed to another that sit@@ te@@ th by , let the first hold his peace .
for ye may all pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comfor@@ ted .
and the spir@@ its of the pro@@ ph@@ ets are subject to the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
for God is not the author of conf@@ usion , but of peace , as in all churches of the sa@@ ints .
let your women keep sil@@ ence in the churches : for it is not per@@ mitted un@@ to them to speak ; but they are comman@@ ded to be under obe@@ di@@ ence , as also sa@@ ith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their hus@@ bands at home : for it is a sh@@ ame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write un@@ to you are the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord .
but if any man be ignor@@ ant , let him be ignor@@ ant .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , bre@@ th@@ ren , c@@ ov@@ et to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , and for@@ bid not to speak with ton@@ gues .
moreover , bre@@ th@@ ren , I declare un@@ to you the g@@ os@@ p@@ el which I pre@@ ached un@@ to you , which also ye have received , and where@@ in ye stand ;
by which also ye are sav@@ ed , if ye keep in memory what I pre@@ ached un@@ to you , unless ye have believed in v@@ ain .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred bre@@ th@@ ren at once ; of whom the greater part remain un@@ to this present , but some are fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
for I am the least of the A@@ post@@ les , that am not meet to be called an A@@ pos@@ tle , because I persec@@ uted the church of God .
now if Ch@@ r@@ ist be pre@@ ached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead ?
but if there be no resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead , then is Ch@@ r@@ ist not risen :
and if Ch@@ r@@ ist be not risen , then is our pre@@ aching v@@ ain , and your faith is also v@@ ain .
Ye@@ a , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
for if the dead rise not , then is not Ch@@ r@@ ist raised :
and if Ch@@ r@@ ist be not raised , your faith is v@@ ain ; ye are yet in your sin@@ s .
but now is Ch@@ r@@ ist risen from the dead , and become the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of them that sle@@ pt .
for as in A@@ dam all die , even so in Ch@@ r@@ ist shall all be made alive .
then co@@ me@@ th the end , when he shall have delivered up the k@@ ing@@ dom to God , even the F@@ ather ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
and when all things shall be sub@@ du@@ ed un@@ to him , then shall the Son also himself be subject un@@ to him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
else what shall they do which are b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed for the dead ?
if after the manner of men I have fought with be@@ asts at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , what advant@@ ag@@ eth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to mor@@ row we die .
and that which th@@ ou so@@ west , th@@ ou so@@ west not that body that shall be , but b@@ are gra@@ in , it may chance of wheat , or of some other gra@@ in :
but God gi@@ vet@@ h it a body as it hat@@ h pleased him , and to every se@@ ed his own body .
all f@@ les@@ h is not the same f@@ les@@ h : but there is one kind of f@@ les@@ h of men , another f@@ les@@ h of be@@ asts , another of fis@@ hes , and another of birds .
there are also cele@@ sti@@ al bodies , and bodies ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al : but the gl@@ ory of the cele@@ sti@@ al is one , and the gl@@ ory of the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al is another .
so also is the resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead . it is so@@ wn in corruption ; it is raised in incor@@ ruption :
it is so@@ wn in dis@@ honour ; it is raised in gl@@ ory : it is so@@ wn in weak@@ ness ; it is raised in power :
it is so@@ wn a natural body ; it is raised a spir@@ itual body . there is a natural body , and there is a spir@@ itual body .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it that was not first which is spir@@ itual , but that which is natural ; and after@@ ward that which is spir@@ itual .
the first man is of the ear@@ th , earth@@ y : the second man is the Lord from heav@@ en .
as is the earth@@ y , such are they also that are earth@@ y : and as is the heav@@ en@@ ly , such are they also that are heav@@ en@@ ly .
and as we have bor@@ ne the image of the earth@@ y , we shall also bear the image of the heav@@ en@@ ly .
so when this cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble shall have put on incor@@ ruption , and this mort@@ al shall have put on im@@ mortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , De@@ ath is sw@@ allowed up in victory .
therefore , my bel@@ ov@@ ed bre@@ th@@ ren , be ye ste@@ d@@ fast , un@@ mov@@ eable , always ab@@ oun@@ ding in the work of the Lord , for@@ as@@ much as ye know that your labour is not in v@@ ain in the Lord .
now concerning the collection for the sa@@ ints , as I have given order to the churches of Gal@@ ati@@ a , even so do ye .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hat@@ h prosp@@ ered him , that there be no gather@@ ings when I come .
and when I come , wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liber@@ ality un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .
now I will come un@@ to you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
for I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tar@@ ry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
now if Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he wor@@ ket@@ h the work of the Lord , as I also do .
let no man therefore desp@@ ise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come un@@ to me : for I look for him with the bre@@ th@@ ren .
as tou@@ ching our brother A@@ pol@@ los , I greatly desi@@ red him to come un@@ to you with the bre@@ th@@ ren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have conven@@ i@@ ent time .
I am glad of the coming of Stephan@@ as and Fort@@ un@@ at@@ us and A@@ cha@@ ic@@ us : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist by the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , un@@ to the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints which are in all A@@ cha@@ ia :
grace be to you and peace from God our F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
b@@ les@@ sed be God , even the F@@ ather of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the F@@ ather of mer@@ cies , and the God of all comfor@@ t ;
who comfor@@ te@@ th us in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation , that we may be able to comfor@@ t them which are in any trouble , by the comfor@@ t where@@ with we ourselves are comfor@@ ted of God .
and whether we be aff@@ lic@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation , which is effec@@ tual in the en@@ during of the same suffer@@ ings which we also suffer : or whether we be comfor@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation .
and our hope of you is ste@@ d@@ fast , kno@@ wing , that as ye are par@@ tak@@ ers of the suffer@@ ings , so shall ye be also of the con@@ so@@ lation .
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which ra@@ is@@ eth the dead :
but as God is true , our word toward you was not ye@@ a and n@@ ay .
now he which st@@ ab@@ lis@@ het@@ h us with you in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and hat@@ h ano@@ in@@ ted us , is God ;
moreover I call God for a record upon my sou@@ l , that to spar@@ e you I came not as yet un@@ to Cor@@ inth .
not for that we have domin@@ ion over your faith , but are hel@@ pers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heav@@ iness .
for if I make you sor@@ ry , who is he then that mak@@ eth me glad , but the same which is made sor@@ ry by me ?
and I wrote this same un@@ to you , lest , when I came , I should have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
but if any have caused gri@@ ef , he hat@@ h not gri@@ ev@@ ed me , but in part : that I may not over@@ charge you all .
sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inf@@ lic@@ ted of many .
so that contr@@ ar@@ i@@ wise ye ought rather to for@@ give him , and comfor@@ t him , lest perhaps such a one should be sw@@ allowed up with over@@ much sor@@ row .
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obe@@ di@@ ent in all things .
to whom ye for@@ give any thing , I for@@ give also : for if I for@@ gave any thing , to whom I for@@ gave it , for your sak@@ es for@@ gave I it in the person of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
now thanks be un@@ to God , which always ca@@ us@@ eth us to triumph in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and mak@@ eth manif@@ est the sav@@ our of his knowledge by us in every place .
for we are un@@ to God a swe@@ et sav@@ our of Ch@@ r@@ ist , in them that are sav@@ ed , and in them that per@@ ish :
to the one we are the sav@@ our of death un@@ to death ; and to the other the sav@@ our of life un@@ to life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
do we begin again to commen@@ d ourselves ? or need we , as some others , ep@@ ist@@ les of commen@@ dation to you , or letters of commen@@ dation from you ?
For@@ as@@ much as ye are manif@@ est@@ ly declared to be the ep@@ ist@@ le of Ch@@ r@@ ist minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fle@@ sh@@ y tables of the heart .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our suffici@@ ency is of God ;
who also hat@@ h made us able ministers of the new test@@ am@@ ent ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter kil@@ le@@ th , but the spirit gi@@ vet@@ h life .
for even that which was made g@@ lor@@ ious had no gl@@ ory in this respect , by reason of the gl@@ ory that exc@@ elle@@ th .
but their min@@ ds were b@@ lin@@ ded : for until this day remain@@ eth the same v@@ ail un@@ taken away in the reading of the old test@@ am@@ ent ; which v@@ ail is done away in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mer@@ cy , we fa@@ int not ;
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
but if our g@@ os@@ p@@ el be hi@@ d , it is hi@@ d to them that are lost :
in whom the go@@ d of this world hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of them which believe not , lest the light of the g@@ lor@@ ious g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should sh@@ ine un@@ to them .
but we have this treasure in ear@@ then vessels , that the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of the power may be of God , and not of us .
we are troubled on every side , yet not dist@@ ressed ; we are per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed , but not in desp@@ air ;
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that the life also of J@@ es@@ us might be made manif@@ est in our body .
for we which live are al@@ way delivered un@@ to death for J@@ es@@ us ' sake , that the life also of J@@ es@@ us might be made manif@@ est in our mort@@ al f@@ les@@ h .
kno@@ wing that he which raised up the Lord J@@ es@@ us shall raise up us also by J@@ es@@ us , and shall present us with you .
for our light aff@@ li@@ ction , which is but for a moment , wor@@ ket@@ h for us a far more exceeding and eter@@ nal weight of gl@@ ory ;
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al ; but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for in this we gro@@ an , ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly desi@@ ring to be clo@@ th@@ ed upon with our house which is from heav@@ en :
if so be that being clo@@ th@@ ed we shall not be found nak@@ ed .
for we that are in this tab@@ ern@@ acle do gro@@ an , being burdened : not for that we would be un@@ clo@@ th@@ ed , but clo@@ th@@ ed upon , that mortality might be sw@@ allowed up of life .
now he that hat@@ h w@@ rought us for the sel@@ f@@ same thing is God , who also hat@@ h given un@@ to us the ear@@ n@@ est of the Spiri@@ t .
therefore we are always confident , kno@@ wing that , wh@@ il@@ st we are at home in the body , we are ab@@ sent from the Lord :
we are confident , I say , and willing rather to be ab@@ sent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hat@@ h done , whether it be good or bad .
kno@@ wing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manif@@ est un@@ to God ; and I trust also are made manif@@ est in your con@@ sci@@ ences .
for whether we be bes@@ ide ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be so@@ ber , it is for your cause .
for the love of Ch@@ r@@ ist constra@@ in@@ eth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and that he died for all , that they which live should not hen@@ ce@@ forth live un@@ to themselves , but un@@ to him which died for them , and rose again .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore hen@@ ce@@ forth know we no man after the f@@ les@@ h : ye@@ a , though we have known Ch@@ r@@ ist after the f@@ les@@ h , yet now hen@@ ce@@ forth know we him no more .
therefore if any man be in Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is a new cre@@ ature : old things are passed away ; be@@ hold , all things are become new .
and all things are of God , who hat@@ h reconc@@ iled us to himself by J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and hat@@ h given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
now then we are ambassadors for Ch@@ r@@ ist , as though God did bes@@ e@@ ech you by us : we pra@@ y you in Ch@@ r@@ ist 's stead , be ye reconc@@ iled to God .
we then , as workers together with him , bes@@ e@@ ech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in v@@ ain .
( for he sa@@ ith , I have heard the@@ e in a time accepted , and in the day of sal@@ vation have I succ@@ oured the@@ e : be@@ hold , now is the accepted time ; be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation . )
as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , be@@ hold , we live ; as ch@@ as@@ tened , and not killed ;
now for a re@@ comp@@ ence in the same , ( I speak as un@@ to my children , ) be ye also en@@ lar@@ ged .
be ye not un@@ equally yok@@ ed together with un@@ beli@@ ever@@ s : for what fel@@ low@@ ship hat@@ h righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness with un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ? and what commun@@ ion hat@@ h light with d@@ ark@@ ness ?
having therefore these promises , de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed , let us cleans@@ e ourselves from all fil@@ th@@ iness of the f@@ les@@ h and spirit , perf@@ ecting hol@@ iness in the fear of God .
great is my bol@@ d@@ ness of speech toward you , great is my g@@ lor@@ ying of you : I am filled with comfor@@ t , I am exceeding jo@@ y@@ ful in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation .
for , when we were come into Macedonia , our f@@ les@@ h had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were figh@@ t@@ ings , within were fears .
therefore we were comfor@@ ted in your comfor@@ t : ye@@ a , and exce@@ ed@@ ingly the more jo@@ yed we for the joy of Tit@@ us , because his spirit was ref@@ res@@ hed by you all .
for if I have bo@@ asted any thing to him of you , I am not as@@ ha@@ med ; but as we sp@@ ake all things to you in truth , even so our bo@@ asting , which I made before Tit@@ us , is found a truth .
and his in@@ ward aff@@ ection is more ab@@ und@@ ant toward you , wh@@ il@@ st he remember@@ eth the obe@@ di@@ ence of you all , how with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ye received him .
I re@@ jo@@ ice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
for to their power , I bear record , ye@@ a , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
pray@@ ing us with much in@@ treaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fel@@ low@@ ship of the minist@@ ering to the sa@@ ints .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and un@@ to us by the will of God .
In@@ som@@ u@@ ch that we desi@@ red Tit@@ us , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
I speak not by comman@@ d@@ ment , but by occasion of the for@@ war@@ d@@ ness of others , and to prove the sinc@@ erity of your love .
for ye know the grace of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that , though he was rich , yet for your sak@@ es he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and her@@ e@@ in I give my advice : for this is expedi@@ ent for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
for if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hat@@ h , and not according to that he hat@@ h not .
but thanks be to God , which put the same ear@@ n@@ est care into the heart of Tit@@ us for you .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the g@@ os@@ p@@ el throughout all the churches ;
avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this ab@@ und@@ ance which is administered by us :
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have of@@ ten@@ times proved dil@@ ig@@ ent in many things , but now much more dil@@ ig@@ ent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she@@ w ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our bo@@ asting on your behalf .
for as tou@@ ching the minist@@ ering to the sa@@ ints , it is super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous for me to write to you :
yet have I sent the bre@@ th@@ ren , lest our bo@@ asting of you should be in v@@ ain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
L@@ est hap@@ ly if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you un@@ prepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be as@@ ha@@ med in this same confident bo@@ asting .
but this I say , He which so@@ w@@ eth spar@@ ingly shall re@@ ap also spar@@ ingly ; and he which so@@ w@@ eth boun@@ ti@@ fully shall re@@ ap also boun@@ ti@@ fully .
every man according as he pur@@ pos@@ eth in his heart , so let him give ; not gru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , or of necess@@ ity : for God lov@@ eth a che@@ er@@ ful gi@@ ver .
now he that minist@@ er@@ eth se@@ ed to the so@@ wer both minister bread for your food , and multi@@ ply your se@@ ed so@@ wn , and increase the fru@@ its of your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; )
for the administration of this service not only supp@@ li@@ eth the want of the sa@@ ints , but is ab@@ und@@ ant also by many than@@ k@@ s@@ gi@@ v@@ ings un@@ to God ;
wh@@ il@@ es by the experim@@ ent of this minist@@ ration they g@@ lor@@ ify God for your prof@@ essed subj@@ ection un@@ to the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and for your liberal distribution un@@ to them , and un@@ to all men ;
and by their pray@@ er for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
( for the weapons of our war@@ fare are not car@@ nal , but m@@ igh@@ ty through God to the pul@@ ling down of strong holds ; )
casting down imag@@ inations , and every high thing that ex@@ al@@ te@@ th itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into cap@@ tivity every thought to the obe@@ di@@ ence of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hat@@ h given us for edi@@ fication , and not for your destruction , I should not be as@@ ha@@ med :
that I may not seem as if I would ter@@ ri@@ fy you by letters .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such will we be also in de@@ ed when we are present .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compar@@ e ourselves with some that commen@@ d themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not bo@@ ast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hat@@ h distributed to us , a measure to reach even un@@ to you .
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not un@@ to you : for we are come as far as to you also in pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
not bo@@ asting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's la@@ bour@@ s ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be en@@ lar@@ ged by you according to our rule ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ,
to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el in the regions beyond you , and not to bo@@ ast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
for I am Je@@ al@@ ous over you with go@@ dly je@@ al@@ ous@@ y : for I have es@@ po@@ used you to one husband , that I may present you as a ch@@ as@@ te vir@@ gin to Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the ser@@ p@@ ent be@@ gu@@ iled Eve through his sub@@ til@@ ty , so your min@@ ds should be cor@@ rupted from the simp@@ lic@@ ity that is in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
have I committed an off@@ ence in ab@@ asing myself that ye might be ex@@ al@@ ted , because I have pre@@ ached to you the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God freely ?
as the truth of Ch@@ r@@ ist is in me , no man shall stop me of this bo@@ asting in the regions of A@@ cha@@ ia .
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that where@@ in they gl@@ ory , they may be found even as we .
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
that which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , in this confidence of bo@@ asting .
Th@@ ri@@ ce was I beaten with ro@@ ds , once was I st@@ oned , th@@ ri@@ ce I suffered ship@@ w@@ rec@@ k , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
bes@@ ide those things that are without , that which co@@ me@@ th upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
if I must needs gl@@ ory , I will gl@@ ory of the things which concern mine in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities .
the God and F@@ ather of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , which is b@@ les@@ sed for ever@@ more , know@@ eth that I lie not .
in Dam@@ as@@ cus the governor under A@@ ret@@ as the king kept the city of the Dam@@ as@@ cen@@ es with a gar@@ ris@@ on , desi@@ ro@@ us to apprehend me :
it is not expedi@@ ent for me doub@@ t@@ less to gl@@ ory . I will come to visions and reve@@ lations of the Lord .
and lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure through the ab@@ und@@ ance of the reve@@ lations , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , the mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to bu@@ ff@@ et me , lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure .
for this thing I bes@@ ought the Lord th@@ ri@@ ce , that it might de@@ part from me .
and he said un@@ to me , My grace is sufficient for the@@ e : for my strength is made perfect in weak@@ ness . most gla@@ dly therefore will I rather gl@@ ory in my in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities , that the power of Ch@@ r@@ ist may rest upon me .
therefore I take pleas@@ ure in in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities , in re@@ pro@@ aches , in nec@@ essi@@ ties , in persec@@ utions , in dist@@ resses for Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
truly the signs of an A@@ pos@@ tle were w@@ rought among you in all patience , in signs , and won@@ ders , and m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds .
for what is it where@@ in ye were in@@ fer@@ ior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not bur@@ den@@ some to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent un@@ to you ?
I desi@@ red Tit@@ us , and with him I sent a brother . did Tit@@ us make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
this is the third time I am coming to you . in the m@@ outh of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
since ye seek a proof of Ch@@ r@@ ist speaking in me , which to you @@@ -@@ @ ward is not weak , but is m@@ igh@@ ty in you .
for though he was cru@@ ci@@ fied through weak@@ ness , yet he li@@ vet@@ h by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
examine yo@@ ur@@ selves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you , except ye be re@@ prob@@ ates ?
but I trust that ye shall know that we are not re@@ prob@@ ates .
now I pra@@ y to God that ye do no ev@@ il ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as re@@ prob@@ ates .
for we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perf@@ ection .
the grace of the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and the love of God , and the commun@@ ion of the Holy gh@@ ost , be with you all . A@@ men .
grace be to you and peace from God the F@@ ather , and from our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
who gave himself for our sin@@ s , that he might deliver us from this present ev@@ il world , according to the will of God and our F@@ ather :
I mar@@ v@@ el that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Ch@@ r@@ ist un@@ to another g@@ os@@ p@@ el :
which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would per@@ ver@@ t the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but though we , or an an@@ gel from heav@@ en , pre@@ ach any other g@@ os@@ p@@ el un@@ to you than that which we have pre@@ ached un@@ to you , let him be accur@@ sed .
as we said before , so say I now again , If any man pre@@ ach any other g@@ os@@ p@@ el un@@ to you than that ye have received , let him be accur@@ sed .
but I certi@@ fy you , bre@@ th@@ ren , that the g@@ os@@ p@@ el which was pre@@ ached of me is not after man .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persec@@ uted the church of God , and was@@ ted it :
and pro@@ fi@@ ted in the Jews ' religion above many my equ@@ als in mine own nation , being more exce@@ ed@@ ingly z@@ e@@ al@@ ous of the traditions of my fa@@ thers .
neither went I up to Jer@@ usalem to them which were A@@ post@@ les before me ; but I went into Arabia , and returned again un@@ to Dam@@ as@@ cus .
now the things which I write un@@ to you , be@@ hold , before God , I lie not .
and was unknown by face un@@ to the churches of Ju@@ da@@ ea which were in Ch@@ r@@ ist :
but neither Tit@@ us , who was with me , being a Greek , was comp@@ elled to be circum@@ c@@ ised :
to whom we gave place by subj@@ ection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el might continue with you .
but contr@@ ar@@ i@@ wise , when they saw that the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision was committed un@@ to me , as the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the circum@@ c@@ ision was un@@ to Peter ;
( for he that w@@ rought effec@@ tually in Peter to the ap@@ ost@@ le@@ ship of the circum@@ c@@ ision , the same was m@@ igh@@ ty in me toward the Gen@@ ti@@ les : )
only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
but if , while we seek to be justified by Ch@@ r@@ ist , we ourselves also are found sin@@ ners , is therefore Ch@@ r@@ ist the minister of sin ? God for@@ bid .
for if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a trans@@ gres@@ sor .
O fo@@ ol@@ ish Gal@@ ati@@ ans , who hat@@ h be@@ wit@@ ched you , that ye should not obe@@ y the truth , before whose eyes J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h been ev@@ id@@ ently set forth , cru@@ ci@@ fied among you ?
he therefore that minist@@ er@@ eth to you the Spiri@@ t , and wor@@ ket@@ h mir@@ ac@@ les among you , do@@ eth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the cur@@ se : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that continu@@ eth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
Bre@@ th@@ ren , I speak after the manner of men ; Th@@ ough it be but a man 's C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , yet if it be confirmed , no man dis@@ annul@@ le@@ th , or ad@@ de@@ th there@@ to .
for if the inher@@ it@@ ance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Ab@@ ra@@ ham by promise .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God for@@ bid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , veril@@ y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness should have been by the law .
but before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up un@@ to the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the law was our scho@@ olmas@@ ter to bring us un@@ to Ch@@ r@@ ist , that we might be justified by faith .
for as many of you as have been b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed into Ch@@ r@@ ist have put on Ch@@ r@@ ist .
there is neither J@@ ew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
now I say , That the he@@ ir , as long as he is a child , differ@@ eth nothing from a ser@@ vant , though he be lor@@ d of all ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore th@@ ou art no more a ser@@ vant , but a son ; and if a son , then an he@@ ir of God through Ch@@ r@@ ist .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it then , when ye knew not God , ye did service un@@ to them which by nature are no go@@ ds .
but now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beg@@ gar@@ ly elements , where@@ un@@ to ye desire again to be in bon@@ da@@ ge ?
but it is good to be z@@ e@@ al@@ ously affected always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
for it is written , that Ab@@ ra@@ ham had two sons , the one by a bon@@ d@@ ma@@ id , the other by a fre@@ e@@ woman .
but he who was of the bon@@ d@@ woman was born after the f@@ les@@ h ; but he of the fre@@ e@@ woman was by promise .
which things are an alleg@@ ory : for these are the two c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants ; the one from the mount S@@ ina@@ i , which gen@@ der@@ eth to bon@@ da@@ ge , which is A@@ gar .
for this A@@ gar is mount S@@ ina@@ i in Arabia , and answ@@ er@@ eth to Jer@@ usalem which now is , and is in bon@@ da@@ ge with her children .
but Jer@@ usalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
now we , bre@@ th@@ ren , as I@@ sa@@ ac was , are the children of promise .
but as then he that was born after the f@@ les@@ h persec@@ uted him that was born after the Spiri@@ t , even so it is now .
stand fast therefore in the liber@@ ty where@@ with Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h made us free , and be not ent@@ ang@@ led again with the yok@@ e of bon@@ da@@ ge .
for I testify again to every man that is circum@@ c@@ ised , that he is a deb@@ tor to do the whole law .
Ch@@ r@@ ist is become of no effect un@@ to you , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
Y@@ e did run well ; who did hin@@ der you that ye should not obe@@ y the truth ?
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise min@@ ded : but he that troub@@ le@@ th you shall bear his judgment , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he be .
for , bre@@ th@@ ren , ye have been called un@@ to liber@@ ty ; only use not liber@@ ty for an occasion to the f@@ les@@ h , but by love serve one another .
but if ye bi@@ te and dev@@ our one another , take heed that ye be not consu@@ med one of another .
but if ye be led of the Spiri@@ t , ye are not under the law .
but the fruit of the Spiri@@ t is love , joy , peace , long@@ suffering , g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess , Go@@ od@@ ness , faith ,
if we live in the Spiri@@ t , let us also walk in the Spiri@@ t .
Bre@@ th@@ ren , if a man be over@@ taken in a fault , ye which are spir@@ itual , restore such an one in the spirit of me@@ ek@@ ness ; considering th@@ y@@ self , lest th@@ ou also be temp@@ ted .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing in himself alone , and not in another .
let him that is ta@@ ught in the word communicate un@@ to him that teach@@ eth in all good things .
be not dec@@ e@@ ived ; God is not mo@@ cked : for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever a man so@@ w@@ eth , that shall he also re@@ ap .
for he that so@@ w@@ eth to his f@@ les@@ h shall of the f@@ les@@ h re@@ ap corruption ; but he that so@@ w@@ eth to the Spiri@@ t shall of the Spiri@@ t re@@ ap life ever@@ lasting .
and let us not be we@@ ary in well doing : for in due season we shall re@@ ap , if we fa@@ int not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good un@@ to all men , especially un@@ to them who are of the household of faith .
as many as desire to make a fair she@@ w in the f@@ les@@ h , they con@@ strain you to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; only lest they should suffer persec@@ ution for the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for neither they themselves who are circum@@ c@@ ised keep the law ; but desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may gl@@ ory in your f@@ les@@ h .
but God for@@ bid that I should gl@@ ory , save in the cross of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , by whom the world is cru@@ ci@@ fied un@@ to me , and I un@@ to the world .
for in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us neither circum@@ c@@ ision avail@@ eth anything , nor un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , but a new cre@@ ature .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mer@@ cy , and upon the Israel of God .
from hen@@ ce@@ forth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord J@@ es@@ us .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist by the will of God , to the sa@@ ints which are at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and to the fa@@ ith@@ ful in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us :
grace be to you , and peace , from God our F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
b@@ les@@ sed be the God and F@@ ather of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , who hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed us with all spir@@ itual b@@ les@@ s@@ ings in heav@@ en@@ ly places in Ch@@ r@@ ist :
according as he hat@@ h chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be hol@@ y and without blame before him in love :
having pre@@ dest@@ inated us un@@ to the adoption of children by J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist to himself , according to the good pleas@@ ure of his will ,
having made known un@@ to us the my@@ ster@@ y of his will , according to his good pleas@@ ure which he hat@@ h pur@@ posed in himself :
in whom also we have obtained an inher@@ it@@ ance , being pre@@ dest@@ inated according to the purpose of him who wor@@ ket@@ h all things after the coun@@ sel of his own will :
in whom ye also tr@@ usted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of your sal@@ vation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that hol@@ y Spiri@@ t of promise ,
which is the ear@@ n@@ est of our inher@@ it@@ ance until the re@@ dem@@ ption of the purchased possession , un@@ to the praise of his gl@@ ory .
that the God of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the F@@ ather of gl@@ ory , may give un@@ to you the spirit of wis@@ dom and reve@@ lation in the knowledge of him :
far above all princip@@ ality , and power , and might , and domin@@ ion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
and hat@@ h raised us up together , and made us sit together in heav@@ en@@ ly places in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us :
that in the ages to come he might she@@ w the exceeding ri@@ ches of his grace in his kin@@ d@@ ness toward us through Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
for by grace are ye sav@@ ed through faith ; and that not of yo@@ ur@@ selves : it is the gift of God :
for we are his work@@ manship , created in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us un@@ to good works , which God hat@@ h before or@@ da@@ ined that we should walk in them .
and came and pre@@ ached peace to you which were af@@ ar off , and to them that were n@@ igh .
now therefore ye are no more st@@ ran@@ gers and foreigners , but fel@@ low@@ citizens with the sa@@ ints , and of the household of God ;
and are built upon the foundation of the A@@ post@@ les and pro@@ ph@@ ets , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist himself being the chief cor@@ ner stone ;
if ye have heard of the dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ation of the grace of God which is given me to you@@ ward :
how that by reve@@ lation he made known un@@ to me the my@@ ster@@ y ; ( as I wrote a@@ fore in few words ,
where@@ by , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the my@@ ster@@ y of Ch@@ r@@ ist )
which in other ages was not made known un@@ to the sons of men , as it is now revealed un@@ to his hol@@ y A@@ post@@ les and pro@@ ph@@ ets by the Spiri@@ t ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ of I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given un@@ to me by the effec@@ tual working of his power .
to the intent that now un@@ to the princip@@ alities and powers in heav@@ en@@ ly places might be known by the church the manif@@ old wis@@ dom of God ,
now un@@ to him that is able to do exceeding ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that wor@@ ket@@ h in us ,
I therefore , the prison@@ er of the Lord , bes@@ e@@ ech you that ye walk wor@@ thy of the voc@@ ation where@@ with ye are called ,
en@@ deav@@ our@@ ing to keep the unity of the Spiri@@ t in the bond of peace .
but un@@ to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
he that des@@ cen@@ ded is the same also that as@@ cen@@ ded up far above all heav@@ ens , that he might fill all things . )
and he gave some , A@@ post@@ les ; and some , pro@@ ph@@ ets ; and some , Evangel@@ ists ; and some , p@@ ast@@ ors and teachers ;
for the perf@@ ecting of the sa@@ ints , for the work of the ministry , for the edi@@ fying of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
but speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Ch@@ r@@ ist :
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye hen@@ ce@@ forth walk not as other Gen@@ ti@@ les walk , in the van@@ ity of their mind ,
having the understanding dar@@ ken@@ ed , being ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God through the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness of their heart :
if so be that ye have heard him , and have been ta@@ ught by him , as the truth is in J@@ es@@ us :
and that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and true hol@@ iness .
be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wr@@ ath :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your m@@ outh , but that which is good to the use of edi@@ fying , that it may minister grace un@@ to the hear@@ ers .
and gri@@ eve not the hol@@ y Spiri@@ t of God , where@@ by ye are sealed un@@ to the day of re@@ dem@@ ption .
let all bit@@ ter@@ ness , and wr@@ ath , and an@@ ger , and c@@ lam@@ our , and ev@@ il speaking , be put away from you , with all mal@@ ice :
but for@@ nic@@ ation , and all un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess , or c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , let it not be once named among you , as bec@@ o@@ me@@ th sa@@ ints ;
for this ye know , that no wh@@ ore@@ mon@@ ger , nor un@@ clean person , nor c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous man , who is an i@@ do@@ later , hat@@ h any inher@@ it@@ ance in the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ch@@ r@@ ist and of God .
let no man dec@@ e@@ ive you with v@@ ain words : for because of these things co@@ me@@ th the wr@@ ath of God upon the children of dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence .
for ye were sometimes d@@ ark@@ ness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
( for the fruit of the Spiri@@ t is in all Go@@ od@@ ness and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and truth ; )
for it is a sh@@ ame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
but all things that are re@@ proved are made manif@@ est by the light : for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever do@@ th make manif@@ est is light .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore he sa@@ ith , aw@@ ake th@@ ou that sle@@ ep@@ est , and arise from the dead , and Ch@@ r@@ ist shall give the@@ e light .
speaking to yo@@ ur@@ selves in p@@ sal@@ ms and hy@@ m@@ ns and spir@@ itual songs , singing and making me@@ lo@@ dy in your heart to the Lord ;
giving thanks always for all things un@@ to God and the F@@ ather in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as Ch@@ r@@ ist is the head of the church : and he is the sa@@ vi@@ our of the body .
therefore as the church is subject un@@ to Ch@@ r@@ ist , so let the wi@@ ves be to their own hus@@ bands in every thing .
for we are members of his body , of his f@@ les@@ h , and of his b@@ ones .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined un@@ to his wife , and they two shall be one f@@ les@@ h .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she rever@@ ence her husband .
honour TH@@ Y father and mother ; ( which is the first comman@@ d@@ ment with promise ; )
and , ye fa@@ thers , prov@@ oke not your children to wr@@ ath : but bring them up in the nur@@ ture and ad@@ mon@@ ition of the Lord .
servants , be obe@@ di@@ ent to them that are your mas@@ ters according to the f@@ les@@ h , with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , in sing@@ len@@ ess of your heart , as un@@ to Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
kno@@ wing that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever good thing any man do@@ eth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
finally , my bre@@ th@@ ren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
put on the whole arm@@ our of God , that ye may be able to stand against the w@@ il@@ es of the dev@@ il .
for we wrest@@ le not against f@@ les@@ h and blood , but against princip@@ alities , against powers , against the rul@@ ers of the d@@ ark@@ ness of this world , against spir@@ itual w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in high places .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore take un@@ to you the whole arm@@ our of God , that ye may be able to with@@ stand in the ev@@ il day , and having done all , to stand .
above all , taking the shield of faith , where@@ with ye shall be able to qu@@ en@@ ch all the fi@@ ery dar@@ ts of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
and take the hel@@ met of sal@@ vation , and the s@@ word of the Spiri@@ t , which is the word of God :
and for me , that ut@@ ter@@ ance may be given un@@ to me , that I may open my m@@ outh bol@@ dly , to make known the my@@ ster@@ y of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el ,
for which I am an ambassador in bonds : that there@@ in I may speak bol@@ dly , as I ought to speak .
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , T@@ y@@ chic@@ us , a bel@@ ov@@ ed brother and fa@@ ith@@ ful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
whom I have sent un@@ to you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts .
peace be to the bre@@ th@@ ren , and love with faith , from God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
Paul and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , the servants of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , to all the sa@@ ints in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us which are at Philip@@ pi , with the bis@@ hop@@ s and de@@ ac@@ ons :
grace be un@@ to you , and peace , from God our F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
being confident of this very thing , that he which hat@@ h begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
for God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bo@@ wel@@ s of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but I would ye should understand , bre@@ th@@ ren , that the things which happened un@@ to me have fallen out rather un@@ to the further@@ ance of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el ;
and many of the bre@@ th@@ ren in the Lord , wa@@ xing confident by my bonds , are much more b@@ old to speak the word without fear .
the one pre@@ ach Ch@@ r@@ ist of contention , not sinc@@ er@@ ely , sup@@ posing to add aff@@ li@@ ction to my bonds :
what then ? no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , every way , whether in pre@@ ten@@ ce , or in truth , Ch@@ r@@ ist is pre@@ ached ; and I there@@ in do re@@ jo@@ ice , ye@@ a , and will re@@ jo@@ ice .
for I know that this shall turn to my sal@@ vation through your pray@@ er , and the supply of the Spiri@@ t of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
but if I live in the f@@ les@@ h , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wo@@ t not .
for I am in a stra@@ it bet@@ wi@@ xt two , having a desire to de@@ part , and to be with Ch@@ r@@ ist ; which is far better :
and having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your further@@ ance and joy of faith ;
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
let this mind be in you , which was also in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us :
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , as ye have always obe@@ yed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own sal@@ vation with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
Ye@@ a , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and re@@ jo@@ ice with you all .
but I trust in the Lord J@@ es@@ us to send Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us shortly un@@ to you , that I also may be of good comfor@@ t , when I know your state .
for all seek their own , not the things which are J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
him therefore I hope to send present@@ ly , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
yet I supposed it necessary to send to you E@@ pap@@ h@@ ro@@ di@@ tus , my brother , and compan@@ ion in labour , and fel@@ low@@ soldier , but your mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he that minist@@ ered to my wants .
for he lon@@ ged after you all , and was full of heav@@ iness , because that ye had heard that he had been si@@ ck .
for indeed he was si@@ ck n@@ igh un@@ to death : but God had mer@@ cy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sor@@ row upon sor@@ row .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may re@@ jo@@ ice , and that I may be the less sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful .
because for the work of Ch@@ r@@ ist he was n@@ igh un@@ to death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
finally , my bre@@ th@@ ren , re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not gri@@ ev@@ ous , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circum@@ c@@ ision , which worship God in the spirit , and re@@ jo@@ ice in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , and have no confidence in the f@@ les@@ h .
though I might also have confidence in the f@@ les@@ h . if any other man thin@@ ket@@ h that he hat@@ h where@@ of he might trust in the f@@ les@@ h , I more :
C@@ irc@@ um@@ c@@ ised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ; as tou@@ ching the law , a P@@ har@@ is@@ ee ;
not as though I had already at@@ tained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus min@@ ded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise min@@ ded , God shall reveal even this un@@ to you .
nevertheless , where@@ to we have already at@@ tained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
Bre@@ th@@ ren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an en@@ samp@@ le .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even we@@ eping , that they are the enem@@ ies of the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
whose end is destruction , whose God is their bel@@ ly , and whose gl@@ ory is in their sh@@ ame , who mind earth@@ ly things . )
for our conversation is in heav@@ en ; from wh@@ ence also we look for the Sav@@ i@@ our , the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
who shall change our v@@ ile body , that it may be fas@@ hi@@ oned like un@@ to his g@@ lor@@ ious body , according to the working where@@ by he is able even to sub@@ due all things un@@ to himself .
let your moder@@ ation be known un@@ to all men . the Lord is at hand .
be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving let your requests be made known un@@ to God .
and the peace of God , which pass@@ eth all understanding , shall keep your hear@@ ts and min@@ ds through Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
but I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hat@@ h flo@@ ur@@ ished again ; where@@ in ye were also careful , but ye la@@ cked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever state I am , there@@ with to be content .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my aff@@ li@@ ction .
now ye Philip@@ p@@ ians know also , that in the beginning of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , when I depar@@ ted from Macedonia , no church communic@@ ated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may ab@@ ound to your account .
since we heard of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , and of the love which ye have to all the sa@@ ints ,
as ye also learned of E@@ pap@@ h@@ ras our de@@ ar fel@@ low@@ ser@@ vant , who is for you a fa@@ ith@@ ful minister of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
giving thanks un@@ to the F@@ ather , which hat@@ h made us meet to be par@@ tak@@ ers of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the sa@@ ints in light :
who hat@@ h delivered us from the power of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h translated us into the k@@ ing@@ dom of his de@@ ar Son :
in whom we have re@@ dem@@ ption through his blood , even the for@@ gi@@ veness of sin@@ s :
and he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the fir@@ st@@ born from the dead ; that in all things he might have the pre@@ emin@@ ence .
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconc@@ ile all things un@@ to himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in ear@@ th , or things in heav@@ en .
and you , that were some@@ time ali@@ en@@ ated and enem@@ ies in your mind by w@@ ic@@ ked works , yet now hat@@ h he reconc@@ iled
who now re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the church :
whom we pre@@ ach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wis@@ dom ; that we may present every man perfect in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us :
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at La@@ odi@@ cea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the f@@ les@@ h ;
for though I be ab@@ sent in the f@@ les@@ h , yet am I with you in the spirit , jo@@ ying and be@@ holding your order , and the ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ness of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
rooted and built up in him , and st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed in the faith , as ye have been ta@@ ught , ab@@ oun@@ ding there@@ in with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
in whom also ye are circum@@ c@@ ised with the circum@@ c@@ ision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h by the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
buried with him in b@@ ap@@ tism , where@@ in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
and you , being dead in your sin@@ s and the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision of your f@@ les@@ h , hat@@ h he quic@@ ken@@ ed together with him , having for@@ given you all t@@ res@@ passes ;
Blo@@ t@@ ting out the hand@@ writing of ord@@ inan@@ ces that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , n@@ ailing it to his cross ;
and having sp@@ o@@ iled princip@@ alities and powers , he made a she@@ w of them openly , tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing over them in it .
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an hol@@ y@@ day , or of the new moon , or of the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days :
which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
if ye then be risen with Ch@@ r@@ ist , seek those things which are above , where Ch@@ r@@ ist sit@@ te@@ th on the right hand of God .
set your aff@@ ection on things above , not on things on the ear@@ th .
when Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in gl@@ ory .
Mor@@ ti@@ fy therefore your members which are upon the ear@@ th ; for@@ nic@@ ation , un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess , in@@ ordinate aff@@ ection , ev@@ il conc@@ up@@ is@@ c@@ ence , and c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , which is i@@ do@@ la@@ try :
for which things ' sake the wr@@ ath of God co@@ me@@ th on the children of dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence :
and have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him :
put on therefore , as the elect of God , hol@@ y and bel@@ ov@@ ed , bo@@ wel@@ s of mer@@ cies , kin@@ d@@ ness , hum@@ b@@ len@@ ess of mind , me@@ ek@@ ness , long@@ suffering ;
For@@ bearing one another , and for@@ giving one another , if any man have a quar@@ rel against any : even as Ch@@ r@@ ist for@@ gave you , so also do ye .
and let the peace of God rule in your hear@@ ts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye than@@ k@@ ful .
let the word of Ch@@ r@@ ist d@@ well in you rich@@ ly in all wis@@ dom ; teaching and ad@@ mon@@ ishing one another in p@@ sal@@ ms and hy@@ m@@ ns and spir@@ itual songs , singing with grace in your hear@@ ts to the Lord .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye do , do it he@@ arti@@ ly , as to the Lord , and not un@@ to men ;
but he that do@@ eth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hat@@ h done : and there is no respect of persons .
Mas@@ ters , give un@@ to your servants that which is just and equal ; kno@@ wing that ye also have a Mas@@ ter in heav@@ en .
W@@ ithal pray@@ ing also for us , that God would open un@@ to us a door of ut@@ ter@@ ance , to speak the my@@ ster@@ y of Ch@@ r@@ ist , for which I am also in bonds :
all my state shall T@@ y@@ chic@@ us declare un@@ to you , who is a bel@@ ov@@ ed brother , and a fa@@ ith@@ ful minister and fel@@ low@@ ser@@ vant in the Lord :
whom I have sent un@@ to you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts ;
Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us my fel@@ low@@ prison@@ er sal@@ u@@ te@@ th you , and Mar@@ cus , sister 's son to Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , ( tou@@ ching whom ye received comman@@ d@@ ments : if he come un@@ to you , receive him ; )
and J@@ es@@ us , which is called J@@ ust@@ us , who are of the circum@@ c@@ ision . these only are my fel@@ low@@ workers un@@ to the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , which have been a comfor@@ t un@@ to me .
for I bear him record , that he hat@@ h a great z@@ e@@ al for you , and them that are in La@@ odi@@ cea , and them in H@@ i@@ er@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
sal@@ ute the bre@@ th@@ ren which are in La@@ odi@@ cea , and N@@ ymp@@ has , and the church which is in his house .
and when this ep@@ ist@@ le is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans ; and that ye likewise read the ep@@ ist@@ le from La@@ odi@@ cea .
for our g@@ os@@ p@@ el came not un@@ to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy gh@@ ost , and in much assur@@ ance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
and ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much aff@@ li@@ ction , with joy of the Holy gh@@ ost :
for from you so@@ unded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith to God @@@ -@@ @ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
for yo@@ ur@@ selves , bre@@ th@@ ren , know our entrance in un@@ to you , that it was not in v@@ ain :
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , even so we speak ; not as ple@@ asing men , but God , which tri@@ eth our hear@@ ts .
nor of men sought we gl@@ ory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been bur@@ den@@ some , as the A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
so being aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately desi@@ ro@@ us of you , we were willing to have im@@ par@@ ted un@@ to you , not the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God only , but also our own so@@ ul@@ s , because ye were de@@ ar un@@ to us .
for ye remember , bre@@ th@@ ren , our labour and trav@@ ail : for la@@ bour@@ ing night and day , because we would not be char@@ ge@@ able un@@ to any of you , we pre@@ ached un@@ to you the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God .
as ye know how we ex@@ hor@@ ted and comfor@@ ted and charged every one of you , as a father do@@ th his children ,
for what is our hope , or joy , or cro@@ wn of re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist at his coming ?
for veril@@ y , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tri@@ bu@@ lation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
for what thanks can we ren@@ der to God again for you , for all the joy where@@ with we joy for your sak@@ es before our God ;
night and day pray@@ ing exce@@ ed@@ ingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now God himself and our F@@ ather , and our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , direct our way un@@ to you .
and the Lord make you to increase and ab@@ ound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
to the end he may st@@ ab@@ lish your hear@@ ts un@@ bla@@ me@@ able in hol@@ iness before God , even our F@@ ather , at the coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist with all his sa@@ ints .
for this is the will of God , even your sanc@@ ti@@ fication , that ye should abst@@ ain from for@@ nic@@ ation :
that no man go beyond and def@@ ra@@ ud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the av@@ eng@@ er of all such , as we also have fore@@ warned you and testified .
he therefore that desp@@ is@@ eth , desp@@ is@@ eth not man , but God , who hat@@ h also given un@@ to us his hol@@ y Spiri@@ t .
but as tou@@ ching bro@@ ther@@ ly love ye need not that I write un@@ to you : for ye yo@@ ur@@ selves are ta@@ ught of God to love one another .
and indeed ye do it toward all the bre@@ th@@ ren which are in all Macedonia : but we bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye increase more and more ;
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we comman@@ ded you ;
that ye may walk hon@@ est@@ ly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack of nothing .
but I would not have you to be ignor@@ ant , bre@@ th@@ ren , concerning them which are as@@ le@@ ep , that ye sor@@ row not , even as others which have no hope .
for this we say un@@ to you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain un@@ to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are as@@ le@@ ep .
for the Lord himself shall des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with the tr@@ um@@ p of God : and the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist shall rise first :
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cl@@ ou@@ ds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
Y@@ e are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of d@@ ark@@ ness .
therefore let us not sle@@ ep , as do others ; but let us watch and be so@@ ber .
for they that sle@@ ep sle@@ ep in the night ; and they that be dr@@ un@@ ken are dr@@ un@@ ken in the night .
but let us , who are of the day , be so@@ ber , putting on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of faith and love ; and for an hel@@ met , the hope of sal@@ vation .
and we bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and ad@@ mon@@ ish you ;
and to es@@ te@@ em them very highly in love for their work 's sake . and be at peace among yo@@ ur@@ selves .
now we ex@@ h@@ ort you , bre@@ th@@ ren , warn them that are un@@ rul@@ y , comfor@@ t the fe@@ eb@@ le@@ min@@ ded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
see that none ren@@ der ev@@ il for ev@@ il un@@ to any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yo@@ ur@@ selves , and to all men .
in every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us concerning you .
and the very God of peace sanc@@ ti@@ fy you wh@@ ol@@ ly ; and I pra@@ y God your whole spirit and sou@@ l and body be preserved bla@@ me@@ less un@@ to the coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
Paul , and Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , un@@ to the church of the Thessalon@@ ians in God our F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
we are bound to than@@ k God always for you , bre@@ th@@ ren , as it is meet , because that your faith grow@@ eth exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other ab@@ oun@@ de@@ th ;
so that we ourselves gl@@ ory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persec@@ utions and Tri@@ bula@@ tions that ye en@@ dur@@ e :
which is a manif@@ est to@@ ken of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God , that ye may be counted wor@@ thy of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , for which ye also suffer :
let no man dec@@ e@@ ive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of per@@ di@@ tion ;
remember ye not , that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
and then shall that W@@ ic@@ ked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consum@@ e with the spirit of his m@@ outh , and shall destroy with the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of his coming :
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to he called you by our g@@ os@@ p@@ el , to the obtaining of the gl@@ ory of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been ta@@ ught , whether by word , or our ep@@ ist@@ le .
finally , bre@@ th@@ ren , pra@@ y for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be gl@@ ori@@ fied , even as it is with you :
and we have confidence in the Lord tou@@ ching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
and the Lord direct your hear@@ ts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now we command you , bre@@ th@@ ren , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother that walk@@ eth dis@@ or@@ derly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for n@@ ought ; but w@@ rought with labour and trav@@ ail night and day , that we might not be char@@ ge@@ able to any of you :
for even when we were with you , this we comman@@ ded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
now them that are such we command and ex@@ h@@ ort by our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that with qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness they work , and eat their own bread .
and if any man obe@@ y not our word by this ep@@ ist@@ le , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
now the end of the comman@@ d@@ ment is charity out of a p@@ ure heart , and of a good con@@ science , and of faith un@@ fe@@ ig@@ ned :
and I than@@ k Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us our Lord , who hat@@ h enabled me , for that he counted me fa@@ ith@@ ful , putting me into the ministry ;
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it for this cause I obtained mer@@ cy , that in me first J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist might she@@ w forth all long@@ suffering , for a pat@@ tern to them which should her@@ e@@ after believe on him to life ever@@ lasting .
now un@@ to the King eter@@ nal , Im@@ mort@@ al , in@@ visible , the only wise God , be honour and gl@@ ory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
of whom is Hy@@ men@@ a@@ e@@ us and Alexander ; whom I have delivered un@@ to S@@ atan , that they may learn not to b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme .
who will have all men to be sav@@ ed , and to come un@@ to the knowledge of the truth .
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to I am or@@ da@@ ined a pre@@ acher , and an A@@ pos@@ tle , ( I speak the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and ver@@ ity .
but I suffer not a woman to te@@ ach , nor to us@@ ur@@ p authority over the man , but to be in sil@@ ence .
for A@@ dam was first formed , then Eve .
a bishop then must be bla@@ me@@ less , the husband of one wife , vig@@ il@@ ant , so@@ ber , of good behaviour , given to hosp@@ it@@ ality , ap@@ t to te@@ ach ;
not given to wine , no stri@@ ker , not gre@@ edy of fil@@ thy lu@@ cr@@ e ; but patient , not a bra@@ w@@ ler , not c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous ;
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a de@@ ac@@ on , being found bla@@ me@@ less .
let the de@@ ac@@ ons be the hus@@ bands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for they that have used the office of a de@@ ac@@ on well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great bol@@ d@@ ness in the faith which is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
if th@@ ou put the bre@@ th@@ ren in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of these things , th@@ ou s@@ halt be a good minister of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , no@@ ur@@ ished up in the words of faith and of good doc@@ tr@@ ine , where@@ un@@ to th@@ ou h@@ ast at@@ tained .
for bo@@ dil@@ y exercise pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th little : but go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess is profitable un@@ to all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
for therefore we both labour and suffer re@@ pro@@ ach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Sav@@ i@@ our of all men , spec@@ ially of those that believe .
let no man desp@@ ise TH@@ Y youth ; but be th@@ ou an example of the beli@@ ever@@ s , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in p@@ urity .
neglec@@ t not the gift that is in the@@ e , which was given the@@ e by pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , with the lay@@ ing on of the hands of the pres@@ by@@ tery .
take heed un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , and un@@ to the doc@@ tr@@ ine ; continue in them : for in doing this th@@ ou s@@ halt both save th@@ y@@ self , and them that hear the@@ e .
re@@ bu@@ ke not an el@@ der , but in@@ treat him as a father ; and the younger men as bre@@ th@@ ren ;
but if any provide not for his own , and spec@@ ially for those of his own house , he hat@@ h denied the faith , and is worse than an in@@ fi@@ del .
and with@@ al they learn to be id@@ le , w@@ and@@ ering about from house to house ; and not only id@@ le , but t@@ att@@ lers also and bus@@ y@@ bodies , speaking things which they ought not .
if any man or woman that believ@@ eth have wi@@ dows , let them reli@@ eve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may reli@@ eve them that are wi@@ dows indeed .
I charge the@@ e before God , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and the elect an@@ gel@@ s , that th@@ ou observe these things without prefer@@ ring one before another , doing nothing by parti@@ ality .
let as many servants as are under the yok@@ e count their own mas@@ ters wor@@ thy of all honour , that the name of God and his doc@@ tr@@ ine be not b@@ las@@ phe@@ med .
but they that will be rich fall into temp@@ tation and a sn@@ are , and into many fo@@ ol@@ ish and hur@@ t@@ ful lu@@ sts , which dro@@ wn men in destruction and per@@ di@@ tion .
for the love of money is the root of all ev@@ il : which while some c@@ ov@@ eted after , they have er@@ red from the faith , and pi@@ er@@ ced themselves through with many sor@@ ro@@ ws .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eter@@ nal life , where@@ un@@ to th@@ ou art also called , and h@@ ast prof@@ essed a good profession before many witnesses .
charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not high@@ min@@ ded , nor trust in uncertain ri@@ ches , but in the living God , who gi@@ vet@@ h us rich@@ ly all things to enjoy ;
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distri@@ bute , willing to communicate ;
lay@@ ing up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eter@@ nal life .
I than@@ k God , whom I serve from my fore@@ fa@@ thers with p@@ ure con@@ science , that without ce@@ asing I have re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the@@ e in my pray@@ ers night and day ;
greatly desi@@ ring to see the@@ e , being min@@ d@@ ful of TH@@ Y te@@ ars , that I may be filled with joy ;
when I call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the un@@ fe@@ ig@@ ned faith that is in the@@ e , which d@@ wel@@ t first in TH@@ Y grand@@ mother Lo@@ is , and TH@@ Y mother E@@ un@@ ice ; and I am persu@@ aded that in the@@ e also .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I put the@@ e in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance that th@@ ou stir up the gift of God , which is in the@@ e by the putting on of my hands .
for God hat@@ h not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
be not th@@ ou therefore as@@ ha@@ med of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prison@@ er : but be th@@ ou par@@ tak@@ er of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el according to the power of God ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to I am appointed a pre@@ acher , and an A@@ pos@@ tle , and a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
hold fast the form of sound words , which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
that good thing which was committed un@@ to the@@ e keep by the Holy gh@@ ost which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in us .
this th@@ ou know@@ est , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are P@@ hy@@ gel@@ lus and Her@@ mo@@ gen@@ es .
but , when he was in Rome , he sought me out very dil@@ ig@@ ently , and found me .
the Lord grant un@@ to him that he may find mer@@ cy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he minist@@ ered un@@ to me at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , th@@ ou know@@ est very well .
T@@ ho@@ u therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
and the things that th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit th@@ ou to fa@@ ith@@ ful men , who shall be able to te@@ ach others also .
no man that war@@ re@@ th ent@@ ang@@ le@@ th himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may ple@@ ase him who hat@@ h chosen him to be a soldier .
it is a fa@@ ith@@ ful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
of these things put them in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the sub@@ ver@@ ting of the hear@@ ers .
study to she@@ w th@@ y@@ self approved un@@ to God , a work@@ man that ne@@ ede@@ th not to be as@@ ha@@ med , righ@@ tly dividing the word of truth .
and their word will eat as do@@ th a can@@ ker : of whom is Hy@@ men@@ a@@ e@@ us and Phil@@ et@@ us ;
who concerning the truth have er@@ red , saying that the resur@@ rec@@ tion is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of ear@@ th ; and some to honour , and some to dis@@ honour .
if a man therefore pur@@ ge himself from these , he shall be a ves@@ sel un@@ to honour , sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared un@@ to every good work .
flee also you@@ th@@ ful lu@@ sts : but follow righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a p@@ ure heart .
and that they may rec@@ over themselves out of the sn@@ are of the dev@@ il , who are taken cap@@ tive by him at his will .
tra@@ itors , head@@ y , high@@ min@@ ded , lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ures more than lov@@ ers of God ;
all s@@ crip@@ ture is given by in@@ spir@@ ation of God , and is profitable for doc@@ tr@@ ine , for re@@ proof , for correc@@ tion , for in@@ struction in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness :
for the time will come when they will not en@@ dur@@ e sound doc@@ tr@@ ine ; but after their own lu@@ sts shall they he@@ ap to themselves teachers , having it@@ ching e@@ ars ;
and they shall turn away their e@@ ars from the truth , and shall be turned un@@ to f@@ ables .
I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith :
for Dem@@ as hat@@ h for@@ sak@@ en me , having lov@@ ed this present world , and is depar@@ ted un@@ to Thessalon@@ ica ; C@@ resc@@ ens to Gal@@ ati@@ a , Tit@@ us un@@ to Dalmati@@ a .
only Luk@@ e is with me . take Mark , and bring him with the@@ e : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
the clo@@ ke that I left at Tro@@ as with Car@@ p@@ us , when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st , bring with the@@ e , and the books , but especially the par@@ ch@@ ments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men for@@ so@@ ok me : I pra@@ y God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every ev@@ il work , and will preserve me un@@ to his heav@@ en@@ ly k@@ ing@@ dom : to whom be gl@@ ory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
do TH@@ Y dil@@ ig@@ ence to come before winter . Eu@@ bul@@ us gre@@ ete@@ th the@@ e , and Pu@@ den@@ s , and Lin@@ us , and Clau@@ dia , and all the bre@@ th@@ ren .
but hat@@ h in due times manif@@ ested his word through pre@@ aching , which is committed un@@ to me according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of God our Sav@@ i@@ our ;
to Tit@@ us , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mer@@ cy , and peace , from God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Sav@@ i@@ our .
for this cause left I the@@ e in Cre@@ te , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest set in order the things that are wan@@ ting , and or@@ da@@ in el@@ ders in every city , as I had appointed the@@ e :
holding fast the fa@@ ith@@ ful word as he hat@@ h been ta@@ ught , that he may be able by sound doc@@ tr@@ ine both to ex@@ h@@ ort and to convince the gain@@ say@@ ers .
whose m@@ ou@@ ths must be stopped , who sub@@ ver@@ t whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for fil@@ thy lu@@ cr@@ e 's sake .
this witness is true . W@@ her@@ e@@ fore re@@ bu@@ ke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
the aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as bec@@ o@@ me@@ th hol@@ iness , not false acc@@ users , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
Ex@@ h@@ ort servants to be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to their own mas@@ ters , and to ple@@ ase them well in all things ; not answ@@ ering again ;
to speak ev@@ il of no man , to be no bra@@ w@@ lers , but g@@ ent@@ le , she@@ wing all me@@ ek@@ ness un@@ to all men .
that being justified by his grace , we should be made he@@ ir@@ s according to the hope of eter@@ nal life .
bring Zen@@ as the lawyer and A@@ pol@@ los on their journey dil@@ ig@@ ently , that nothing be wan@@ ting un@@ to them .
Paul , a prison@@ er of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , un@@ to Phil@@ em@@ on our de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed , and fel@@ low@@ la@@ b@@ ou@@ rer ,
that the communication of TH@@ Y faith may become effec@@ tual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , though I might be much b@@ old in Ch@@ r@@ ist to en@@ join the@@ e that which is conven@@ i@@ ent ,
I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e for my son O@@ nes@@ im@@ us , whom I have be@@ gotten in my bonds :
whom I have sent again : th@@ ou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bo@@ wel@@ s :
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : al@@ be@@ it I do not say to the@@ e how th@@ ou ow@@ est un@@ to me even th@@ ine own self besides .
having confidence in TH@@ Y obe@@ di@@ ence I wrote un@@ to the@@ e , kno@@ wing that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t also do more than I say .
but with@@ al prepare me also a lo@@ d@@ ging : for I trust that through your pray@@ ers I shall be given un@@ to you .
there sal@@ ute the@@ e E@@ pap@@ h@@ ras , my fel@@ low@@ prison@@ er in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us ;
God , who at sun@@ d@@ ry times and in di@@ vers man@@ ners sp@@ ake in time past un@@ to the fa@@ thers by the pro@@ ph@@ ets ,
H@@ ath in these last days spoken un@@ to us by his Son , whom he hat@@ h appointed he@@ ir of all things , by whom also he made the wor@@ l@@ ds ;
being made so much better than the an@@ gel@@ s , as he hat@@ h by inher@@ it@@ ance obtained a more excellent name than they .
and again , when he br@@ ing@@ eth in the fir@@ st@@ be@@ gotten into the world , he sa@@ ith , An@@ d let all the an@@ gel@@ s of God worship him .
but un@@ to the Son he sa@@ ith , Th@@ y th@@ r@@ one , O God , is for ever and ever : a scep@@ tre of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is the scep@@ tre of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom .
and as a ves@@ ture s@@ halt th@@ ou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but th@@ ou art the same , and TH@@ Y years shall not fail .
but to which of the an@@ gel@@ s said he at any time , sit on my right hand , until I make th@@ ine enem@@ ies TH@@ Y foot@@ st@@ ool ?
are they not all minist@@ ering spir@@ its , sent forth to minister for them who shall be he@@ ir@@ s of sal@@ vation ?
therefore we ought to give the more ear@@ n@@ est heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them sli@@ p .
God also bearing them witness , both with signs and won@@ ders , and with di@@ vers mir@@ ac@@ les , and gifts of the Holy gh@@ ost , according to his own will ?
for un@@ to the an@@ gel@@ s hat@@ h he not put in subj@@ ection the world to come , where@@ of we speak .
T@@ ho@@ u ma@@ dest him a little lower than the an@@ gel@@ s ; th@@ ou crow@@ n@@ ed@@ st him with gl@@ ory and honour , and di@@ d@@ st set him over the works of TH@@ Y hands :
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see J@@ es@@ us , who was made a little lower than the an@@ gel@@ s for the suffering of death , crow@@ ned with gl@@ ory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should tas@@ te death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons un@@ to gl@@ ory , to make the captain of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
saying , I will declare TH@@ Y name un@@ to my bre@@ th@@ ren , in the mid@@ st of the church will I sing praise un@@ to the@@ e .
for veril@@ y he took not on him the nature of an@@ gel@@ s ; but he took on him the se@@ ed of Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
for in that he himself hat@@ h suffered being temp@@ ted , he is able to succ@@ our them that are temp@@ ted .
for this man was counted wor@@ thy of more gl@@ ory than Mos@@ es , in@@ as@@ much as he who hat@@ h buil@@ ded the house hat@@ h more honour than the house .
for every house is buil@@ ded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
and Mos@@ es veril@@ y was fa@@ ith@@ ful in all his house , as a ser@@ vant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
but Ch@@ r@@ ist as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing of the hope firm un@@ to the end .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ( as the Holy gh@@ ost sa@@ ith , To day if ye will hear his voice ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I was gri@@ ev@@ ed with that generation , and said , They do al@@ way er@@ r in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
take heed , bre@@ th@@ ren , lest there be in any of you an ev@@ il heart of un@@ belief , in depar@@ ting from the living God .
for we are made par@@ tak@@ ers of Ch@@ r@@ ist , if we hold the beginning of our confidence ste@@ d@@ fast un@@ to the end ;
for some , when they had heard , did prov@@ oke : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it not all that came out of Egypt by Mos@@ es .
but with whom was he gri@@ ev@@ ed for@@ ty years ? was it not with them that had sin@@ ned , whose car@@ cases fell in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ?
and to whom sw@@ are he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for un@@ to us was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached , as well as un@@ to them : but the word pre@@ ached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for he sp@@ ake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , An@@ d God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
for he that is entered into his rest , he also hat@@ h ce@@ ased from his own works , as God did from his .
neither is there any cre@@ ature that is not manif@@ est in his sight : but all things are nak@@ ed and opened un@@ to the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
seeing then that we have a great high pri@@ est , that is passed into the heav@@ ens , J@@ es@@ us the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
for we have not an high pri@@ est which can@@ not be touched with the feeling of our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities ; but was in all points temp@@ ted like as we are , yet without sin .
let us therefore come bol@@ dly un@@ to the th@@ r@@ one of grace , that we may obtain mer@@ cy , and find grace to help in time of need .
for every high pri@@ est taken from among men is or@@ da@@ ined for men in things per@@ taining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for sin@@ s :
who can have comp@@ as@@ sion on the ignor@@ ant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is comp@@ ass@@ ed with in@@ fir@@ mity .
so also Ch@@ r@@ ist gl@@ ori@@ fied not himself to be made an high pri@@ est ; but he that said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u art my Son , to day have I be@@ gotten the@@ e .
though he were a Son , yet learned he obe@@ di@@ ence by the things which he suffered ;
and being made perfect , he became the author of eter@@ nal sal@@ vation un@@ to all them that obe@@ y him ;
of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be ut@@ tered , seeing ye are dul@@ l of hearing .
for every one that us@@ eth milk is un@@ s@@ kil@@ ful in the word of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for he is a bab@@ e .
but strong meat belon@@ get@@ h to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their sen@@ ses exerc@@ ised to dis@@ cer@@ n both good and ev@@ il .
for the ear@@ th which drin@@ ket@@ h in the rain that co@@ me@@ th of@@ t upon it , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth her@@ bs meet for them by whom it is d@@ ressed , recei@@ vet@@ h b@@ les@@ sing from God :
but that which be@@ aret@@ h thor@@ ns and bri@@ ers is rejected , and is n@@ igh un@@ to cur@@ sing ; whose end is to be burned .
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have she@@ wed toward his name , in that ye have minist@@ ered to the sa@@ ints , and do minister .
and we desire that every one of you do she@@ w the same dil@@ ig@@ ence to the full assur@@ ance of hope un@@ to the end :
and so , after he had pati@@ ently en@@ du@@ red , he obtained the promise .
W@@ her@@ e@@ in God , willing more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly to she@@ w un@@ to the he@@ ir@@ s of promise the im@@ mut@@ ability of his coun@@ sel , confirmed it by an oath :
which hope we have as an an@@ ch@@ or of the sou@@ l , both sure and ste@@ d@@ fast , and which enter@@ eth into that within the ve@@ il ;
W@@ hi@@ ther the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner is for us entered , even J@@ es@@ us , made an high pri@@ est for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ is@@ ede@@ c .
for this Mel@@ ch@@ is@@ ede@@ c , king of Sal@@ em , pri@@ est of the most high God , who met Ab@@ ra@@ ham returning from the sla@@ ughter of the kings , and b@@ les@@ sed him ;
now consider how great this man was , un@@ to whom even the patri@@ arch Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave the tenth of the sp@@ o@@ ils .
and here men that die receive ti@@ th@@ es ; but there he recei@@ vet@@ h them , of whom it is witnessed that he li@@ vet@@ h .
and as I may so say , L@@ evi also , who recei@@ vet@@ h ti@@ th@@ es , pay@@ ed ti@@ th@@ es in Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od being changed , there is made of necess@@ ity a change also of the law .
for he of whom these things are spoken per@@ tain@@ eth to another tri@@ be , of which no man gave attendance at the alt@@ ar .
for there is veril@@ y a dis@@ annul@@ ling of the comman@@ d@@ ment going before for the weak@@ ness and un@@ prof@@ it@@ ab@@ len@@ ess there@@ of .
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw n@@ igh un@@ to God .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore he is able also to save them to the ut@@ ter@@ most that come un@@ to God by him , seeing he ever li@@ vet@@ h to make inter@@ c@@ ession for them .
for such an high pri@@ est became us , who is hol@@ y , harm@@ less , un@@ def@@ iled , separate from sin@@ ners , and made higher than the heav@@ ens ;
for every high pri@@ est is or@@ da@@ ined to offer gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es : where@@ fore it is of necess@@ ity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
for if he were on ear@@ th , he should not be a pri@@ est , seeing that there are pri@@ ests that offer gifts according to the law :
but now hat@@ h he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which was established upon better promises .
for if that first C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant had been fa@@ ul@@ t@@ less , then should no place have been sought for the second .
for finding fault with them , he sa@@ ith , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , when I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
and they shall not te@@ ach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , K@@ now the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
for I will be mer@@ ci@@ ful to their un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and their sin@@ s and their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities will I remember no more .
in that he sa@@ ith , A new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , he hat@@ h made the first old . now that which dec@@ ay@@ eth and wa@@ x@@ eth old is ready to van@@ ish away .
then veril@@ y the first C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant had also ord@@ inan@@ ces of div@@ ine service , and a wor@@ l@@ dly sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
for there was a tab@@ ern@@ acle made ; the first , where@@ in was the cand@@ le@@ stick , and the table , and the she@@ w@@ bread ; which is called the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
which had the golden cen@@ ser , and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant over@@ laid round about with gold , where@@ in was the golden po@@ t that had man@@ na , and Aaron 's ro@@ d that bud@@ ded , and the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
but into the second went the high pri@@ est alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the err@@ ors of the people :
the Holy gh@@ ost this sig@@ ni@@ fying , that the way into the hol@@ iest of all was not yet made manif@@ est , while as the first tab@@ ern@@ acle was yet standing :
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as per@@ taining to the con@@ science ;
but Ch@@ r@@ ist being come an high pri@@ est of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tab@@ ern@@ acle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
neither by the blood of go@@ ats and cal@@ ves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the hol@@ y place , having obtained eter@@ nal re@@ dem@@ ption for us .
for if the blood of bul@@ ls and of go@@ ats , and the ashes of an he@@ if@@ er sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ling the un@@ clean , sanc@@ ti@@ fi@@ eth to the pur@@ ifying of the f@@ les@@ h :
for where a test@@ am@@ ent is , there must also of necess@@ ity be the death of the te@@ stat@@ or .
for a test@@ am@@ ent is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the te@@ stat@@ or li@@ vet@@ h .
it was therefore necessary that the pat@@ ter@@ ns of things in the heav@@ ens should be pur@@ ified with these ; but the heav@@ en@@ ly things themselves with better sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es than these .
for Ch@@ r@@ ist is not entered into the hol@@ y places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heav@@ en itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es which they offered year by year continu@@ ally make the com@@ ers there@@ un@@ to perfect .
for then would they not have ce@@ ased to be offered ? because that the wor@@ ship@@ pers once p@@ urged should have had no more con@@ science of sin@@ s .
for it is not possible that the blood of bul@@ ls and of go@@ ats should take away sin@@ s .
then said he , L@@ o , I come to do TH@@ Y will , O God . he tak@@ eth away the first , that he may establish the second .
but this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sin@@ s for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ of the Holy gh@@ ost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with them after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hear@@ ts , and in their min@@ ds will I write them ;
having therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , bol@@ d@@ ness to enter into the hol@@ iest by the blood of J@@ es@@ us ,
let us draw near with a true heart in full assur@@ ance of faith , having our hear@@ ts sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led from an ev@@ il con@@ science , and our bodies was@@ hed with p@@ ure water .
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wa@@ ver@@ ing ; ( for he is fa@@ ith@@ ful that promised ; )
not for@@ sak@@ ing the assemb@@ ling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but ex@@ hor@@ ting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for we know him that hat@@ h said , ven@@ ge@@ ance belon@@ get@@ h un@@ to me , I will re@@ compen@@ se , sa@@ ith the Lord . and again , The Lord shall judge his people .
it is a fear@@ ful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
but call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the former days , in which , after ye were ill@@ umin@@ ated , ye en@@ du@@ red a great fight of aff@@ lic@@ tions ;
partly , wh@@ il@@ st ye were made a gaz@@ ing@@ stock both by re@@ pro@@ aches and aff@@ lic@@ tions ; and partly , wh@@ il@@ st ye became compan@@ ions of them that were so used .
for ye had comp@@ as@@ sion of me in my bonds , and took jo@@ y@@ fully the sp@@ o@@ iling of your goods , kno@@ wing in yo@@ ur@@ selves that ye have in heav@@ en a better and an en@@ during sub@@ stance .
for ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my sou@@ l shall have no pleas@@ ure in him .
but we are not of them who draw back un@@ to per@@ di@@ tion ; but of them that believe to the saving of the sou@@ l .
through faith we understand that the wor@@ l@@ ds were fra@@ med by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith E@@ no@@ ch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his trans@@ lation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
but without faith it is impossible to ple@@ ase him : for he that co@@ me@@ th to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dil@@ ig@@ ently seek him .
by faith Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance , obe@@ yed ; and he went out , not kno@@ wing w@@ hi@@ ther he went .
by faith he so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of promise , as in a st@@ range country , d@@ wel@@ ling in tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise :
for he looked for a city which hat@@ h foundations , whose buil@@ der and maker is God .
through faith also Sar@@ a her@@ self received strength to conce@@ ive se@@ ed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she jud@@ ged him fa@@ ith@@ ful who had promised .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persu@@ aded of them , and embrac@@ ed them , and conf@@ essed that they were st@@ ran@@ gers and pil@@ gri@@ ms on the ear@@ th .
for they that say such things declare pla@@ in@@ ly that they seek a country .
and truly , if they had been min@@ d@@ ful of that country from wh@@ ence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heav@@ en@@ ly : where@@ fore God is not as@@ ha@@ med to be called their God : for he hat@@ h prepared for them a city .
by faith Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was tried , offered up I@@ sa@@ ac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only be@@ gotten son ,
accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from wh@@ ence also he received him in a figure .
by faith Jac@@ o@@ b , when he was a dying , b@@ les@@ sed both the sons of Joseph ; and wor@@ shi@@ pped , le@@ an@@ ing upon the top of his staff .
by faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the depar@@ ting of the children of Israel ; and gave comman@@ d@@ ment concerning his b@@ ones .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hi@@ d three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ;
choosing rather to suffer aff@@ li@@ ction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleas@@ ures of sin for a season ;
E@@ ste@@ em@@ ing the re@@ pro@@ ach of Ch@@ r@@ ist greater ri@@ ches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect un@@ to the re@@ comp@@ ence of the reward .
by faith he for@@ so@@ ok Egypt , not fearing the wr@@ ath of the king : for he en@@ du@@ red , as seeing him who is in@@ visible .
by faith they passed through the Red sea as by d@@ ry land : which the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans as@@ saying to do were dro@@ w@@ ned .
by faith the har@@ lot Ra@@ ha@@ b per@@ ished not with them that believed not , when she had received the sp@@ ies with peace .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of B@@ arak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ a@@ e ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the pro@@ ph@@ ets :
Qu@@ en@@ ched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the s@@ word , out of weak@@ ness were made strong , wa@@ xed val@@ i@@ ant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the ali@@ ens .
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tor@@ tured , not accepting deliver@@ ance ; that they might obtain a better resur@@ rec@@ tion :
and others had trial of cru@@ el mo@@ ck@@ ings and s@@ cour@@ g@@ ings , ye@@ a , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were st@@ oned , they were sa@@ wn as@@ under , were temp@@ ted , were sla@@ in with the s@@ word : they w@@ and@@ ered about in she@@ ep@@ sk@@ ins and go@@ at@@ sk@@ ins ; being de@@ stitute , aff@@ lic@@ ted , tor@@ mented ;
( of whom the world was not wor@@ thy : ) they w@@ and@@ ered in de@@ ser@@ ts , and in mountains , and in den@@ s and c@@ aves of the ear@@ th .
looking un@@ to J@@ es@@ us the author and fin@@ is@@ her of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising the sh@@ ame , and is set down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
for consider him that en@@ du@@ red such con@@ tradi@@ ction of sin@@ ners against himself , lest ye be we@@ ar@@ ied and fa@@ int in your min@@ ds .
and ye have forgotten the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation which speak@@ eth un@@ to you as un@@ to children , My son , desp@@ ise not th@@ ou the ch@@ as@@ tening of the Lord , nor fa@@ int when th@@ ou art re@@ bu@@ ked of him :
but if ye be without ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement , where@@ of all are par@@ tak@@ ers , then are ye bas@@ tar@@ ds , and not sons .
now no ch@@ as@@ tening for the present se@@ eme@@ th to be jo@@ y@@ ous , but gri@@ ev@@ ous : nevertheless after@@ ward it yi@@ el@@ de@@ th the peac@@ eable fruit of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to them which are exerc@@ ised there@@ by .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore lift up the hands which han@@ g down , and the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es ;
looking dil@@ ig@@ ently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bit@@ ter@@ ness spr@@ inging up trouble you , and there@@ by many be def@@ iled ;
( for they could not en@@ dur@@ e that which was comman@@ ded , An@@ d if so much as a be@@ ast touch the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned , or th@@ rust through with a d@@ art :
and this word , Y@@ et once more , sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ eth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which can@@ not be shaken may remain .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore we receiving a k@@ ing@@ dom which can@@ not be moved , let us have grace , where@@ by we may serve God accep@@ tably with rever@@ ence and go@@ dly fear :
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer ad@@ versity , as being yo@@ ur@@ selves also in the body .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken un@@ to you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
be not carried about with di@@ vers and st@@ range doc@@ tr@@ ines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with me@@ ats , which have not pro@@ fi@@ ted them that have been occupied there@@ in .
for the bodies of those be@@ asts , whose blood is brought into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary by the high pri@@ est for sin , are burned without the camp .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continu@@ ally , that is , the fruit of our li@@ ps giving thanks to his name .
but I bes@@ e@@ ech you the rather to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord J@@ es@@ us , that great she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of the she@@ ep , through the blood of the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wel@@ l@@ ple@@ asing in his sight , through J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ; to whom be gl@@ ory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
and I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , suffer the word of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation : for I have written a letter un@@ to you in few words .
know ye that our brother Tim@@ o@@ thy is set at liber@@ ty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
sal@@ ute all them that have the rule over you , and all the sa@@ ints . they of Italy sal@@ ute you .
James , a ser@@ vant of God and of the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , to the twelve tri@@ bes which are sc@@ at@@ tered abroad , gre@@ et@@ ing .
if any of you lack wis@@ dom , let him ask of God , that gi@@ vet@@ h to all men liber@@ ally , and up@@ bra@@ ide@@ th not ; and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing wa@@ ver@@ ing . for he that wa@@ ver@@ eth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tos@@ sed .
let the brother of low degree re@@ jo@@ ice in that he is ex@@ al@@ ted :
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that en@@ du@@ re@@ th temp@@ tation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the cro@@ wn of life , which the Lord hat@@ h promised to them that love him .
but every man is temp@@ ted , when he is drawn away of his own l@@ ust , and en@@ ticed .
then when l@@ ust hat@@ h conce@@ ived , it br@@ ing@@ eth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , br@@ ing@@ eth forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and co@@ me@@ th down from the F@@ ather of lights , with whom is no vari@@ ab@@ len@@ ess , neither shadow of turning .
of his own will beg@@ at he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of his cre@@ atures .
for if any be a hear@@ er of the word , and not a do@@ er , he is like un@@ to a man be@@ holding his natural face in a glass :
for he be@@ hol@@ de@@ th himself , and go@@ eth his way , and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay for@@ get@@ te@@ th what manner of man he was .
but wh@@ os@@ o lo@@ ok@@ eth into the perfect law of liber@@ ty , and continu@@ eth there@@ in , he being not a F@@ org@@ et@@ ful hear@@ er , but a do@@ er of the work , this man shall be b@@ les@@ sed in his de@@ ed .
if any man among you seem to be religious , and bri@@ d@@ le@@ th not his ton@@ gue , but dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h his own heart , this man 's religion is v@@ ain .
p@@ ure religion and un@@ def@@ iled before God and the F@@ ather is this , To visit the fa@@ ther@@ less and wi@@ dows in their aff@@ li@@ ction , and to keep himself un@@ spot@@ ted from the world .
my bre@@ th@@ ren , have not the faith of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Lord of gl@@ ory , with respect of persons .
Hear@@ ken , my bel@@ ov@@ ed bre@@ th@@ ren , H@@ ath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and he@@ ir@@ s of the k@@ ing@@ dom which he hat@@ h promised to them that love him ?
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be jud@@ ged by the law of liber@@ ty .
for he shall have judgment without mer@@ cy , that hat@@ h she@@ wed no mer@@ cy ; and mer@@ cy re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth against judgment .
was not Ab@@ ra@@ ham our father justified by works , when he had offered I@@ sa@@ ac his son upon the alt@@ ar ?
Y@@ e see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
likewise also was not Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot justified by works , when she had received the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and had sent them out another way ?
for as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
for in many things we off@@ end all . if any man off@@ end not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bri@@ dle the whole body .
be@@ hold , we put bi@@ ts in the hor@@ ses ' m@@ ou@@ ths , that they may obe@@ y us ; and we turn about their whole body .
be@@ hold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the governor liste@@ th .
for every kind of be@@ asts , and of birds , and of Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and of things in the sea , is ta@@ med , and hat@@ h been ta@@ med of man@@ kind :
T@@ her@@ e@@ with b@@ less we God , even the F@@ ather ; and there@@ with cur@@ se we men , which are made after the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of God .
out of the same m@@ outh proce@@ ede@@ th b@@ les@@ sing and cur@@ sing . my bre@@ th@@ ren , these things ought not so to be .
can the fi@@ g tree , my bre@@ th@@ ren , bear olive ber@@ ries ? either a v@@ ine , fig@@ s ? so can no fo@@ un@@ tain both yield salt water and fresh .
who is a wise man and en@@ du@@ ed with knowledge among you ? let him she@@ w out of a good conversation his works with me@@ ek@@ ness of wis@@ dom .
but if ye have bitter en@@ v@@ ying and stri@@ fe in your hear@@ ts , gl@@ ory not , and lie not against the truth .
but the wis@@ dom that is from above is first p@@ ure , then peac@@ eable , g@@ ent@@ le , and easy to be in@@ treated , full of mer@@ cy and good fru@@ its , without parti@@ ality , and without hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
and the fruit of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is so@@ wn in peace of them that make peace .
from wh@@ ence come wars and figh@@ t@@ ings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lu@@ sts that war in your members ?
Y@@ e ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is en@@ mity with God ? wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
draw n@@ igh to God , and he will draw n@@ igh to you . cleans@@ e your hands , ye sin@@ ners ; and pur@@ ify your hear@@ ts , ye double min@@ ded .
be aff@@ lic@@ ted , and mour@@ n , and we@@ ep : let your la@@ ughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heav@@ iness .
hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
go to now , ye rich men , we@@ ep and ho@@ w@@ l for your mis@@ eries that shall come upon you .
Y@@ e have lived in pleas@@ ure on the ear@@ th , and been wan@@ ton ; ye have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts , as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
Y@@ e have condemned and killed the just ; and he do@@ th not res@@ ist you .
be patient therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , un@@ to the coming of the Lord . be@@ hold , the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fruit of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
be ye also patient ; st@@ ab@@ lish your hear@@ ts : for the coming of the Lord dra@@ w@@ eth n@@ igh .
Gru@@ dge not one against another , bre@@ th@@ ren , lest ye be condemned : be@@ hold , the judge stan@@ de@@ th before the door .
be@@ hold , we count them happy which en@@ dur@@ e . Y@@ e have heard of the patience of Jo@@ b , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very p@@ iti@@ ful , and of tender mer@@ cy .
is any si@@ ck among you ? let him call for the el@@ ders of the church ; and let them pra@@ y over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord :
and the pray@@ er of faith shall save the si@@ ck , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sin@@ s , they shall be for@@ given him .
conf@@ ess your fa@@ ults one to another , and pra@@ y one for another , that ye may be he@@ aled . the effec@@ tual fer@@ v@@ ent pray@@ er of a righ@@ te@@ ous man avail@@ eth much .
and he pray@@ ed again , and the heav@@ en gave rain , and the ear@@ th brought forth her fruit .
W@@ her@@ e@@ in ye greatly re@@ jo@@ ice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heav@@ iness through manif@@ old temp@@ tations :
whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believ@@ ing , ye re@@ jo@@ ice with joy un@@ speak@@ able and full of gl@@ ory :
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore gir@@ d up the lo@@ ins of your mind , be so@@ ber , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought un@@ to you at the reve@@ lation of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
but as he which hat@@ h called you is hol@@ y , so be ye hol@@ y in all manner of conversation ;
and if ye call on the F@@ ather , who without respect of persons jud@@ get@@ h according to every man 's work , pass the time of your so@@ jour@@ ning here in fear :
who veril@@ y was fore@@ or@@ da@@ ined before the foundation of the world , but was manif@@ est in these last times for you ,
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him gl@@ ory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing ye have pur@@ ified your so@@ ul@@ s in obe@@ ying the truth through the Spiri@@ t un@@ to un@@ fe@@ ig@@ ned love of the bre@@ th@@ ren , see that ye love one another with a p@@ ure heart fer@@ v@@ ently :
being born again , not of cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble se@@ ed , but of incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble , by the word of God , which li@@ vet@@ h and abi@@ de@@ th for ever .
if so be ye have tas@@ ted that the Lord is gr@@ ac@@ ious .
to whom coming , as un@@ to a living stone , dis@@ allowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and pre@@ ci@@ ous ,
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , an hol@@ y nation , a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people ; that ye should she@@ w forth the pra@@ ises of him who hat@@ h called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous light :
which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mer@@ cy , but now have obtained mer@@ cy .
having your conversation honest among the Gen@@ ti@@ les : that , whereas they speak against you as ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , they may by your good works , which they shall be@@ hold , g@@ lor@@ ify God in the day of vis@@ itation .
for so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to sil@@ ence the ignor@@ ance of fo@@ ol@@ ish men :
for even her@@ e@@ un@@ to were ye called : because Ch@@ r@@ ist also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
who , when he was re@@ vil@@ ed , re@@ vil@@ ed not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that jud@@ get@@ h righ@@ te@@ ously :
who his own self b@@ are our sin@@ s in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sin@@ s , should live un@@ to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : by whose stri@@ pes ye were he@@ aled .
whose ad@@ or@@ ning let it not be that ou@@ tw@@ ard ad@@ or@@ ning of pla@@ iting the ha@@ ir , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of appar@@ el ;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble , even the or@@ nament of a me@@ ek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
for after this manner in the old time the hol@@ y women also , who tr@@ usted in God , ad@@ or@@ ned themselves , being in subj@@ ection un@@ to their own hus@@ bands :
not ren@@ dering ev@@ il for ev@@ il , or rail@@ ing for rail@@ ing : but contr@@ ar@@ i@@ wise b@@ les@@ sing ; kno@@ wing that ye are there@@ un@@ to called , that ye should inher@@ it a b@@ les@@ sing .
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his ton@@ gue from ev@@ il , and his li@@ ps that they speak no gu@@ ile :
let him es@@ ch@@ ew ev@@ il , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensu@@ e it .
for the eyes of the Lord are over the righ@@ te@@ ous , and his e@@ ars are open un@@ to their pray@@ ers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do ev@@ il .
and who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
but and if ye suffer for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask@@ eth you a reason of the hope that is in you with me@@ ek@@ ness and fear :
for it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for ev@@ il doing .
For@@ as@@ much then as Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h suffered for us in the f@@ les@@ h , arm yo@@ ur@@ selves likewise with the same mind : for he that hat@@ h suffered in the f@@ les@@ h hat@@ h ce@@ ased from sin ;
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the f@@ les@@ h to the lu@@ sts of men , but to the will of God .
W@@ her@@ e@@ in they think it st@@ range that ye run not with them to the same exc@@ ess of riot , speaking ev@@ il of you :
for for this cause was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached also to them that are dead , that they might be jud@@ ged according to men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live according to God in the spirit .
and above all things have fer@@ v@@ ent charity among yo@@ ur@@ selves : for charity shall cover the multi@@ tude of sin@@ s .
as every man hat@@ h received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good ste@@ wards of the manif@@ old grace of God .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , think it not st@@ range concerning the fi@@ ery trial which is to try you , as though some st@@ range thing happened un@@ to you :
but re@@ jo@@ ice , in@@ as@@ much as ye are par@@ tak@@ ers of Ch@@ r@@ ist 's suffer@@ ings ; that , when his gl@@ ory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
but let none of you suffer as a mur@@ der@@ er , or as a th@@ i@@ ef , or as an ev@@ il@@ do@@ er , or as a bus@@ y@@ body in other men 's matters .
yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be as@@ ha@@ med ; but let him g@@ lor@@ ify God on this behalf .
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obe@@ y not the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their so@@ ul@@ s to him in well doing , as un@@ to a fa@@ ith@@ ful Cre@@ ator .
and when the chief she@@ ph@@ er@@ d shall appear , ye shall receive a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory that f@@ ade@@ th not away .
likewise , ye younger , submit yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the el@@ der . Ye@@ a , all of you be subject one to another , and be clo@@ th@@ ed with hum@@ il@@ ity : for God res@@ iste@@ th the proud , and gi@@ vet@@ h grace to the hum@@ ble .
hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore under the m@@ igh@@ ty hand of God , that he may ex@@ alt you in due time :
be so@@ ber , be vig@@ il@@ ant ; because your ad@@ versary the dev@@ il , as a ro@@ aring lion , walk@@ eth about , seeking whom he may dev@@ our :
whom res@@ ist ste@@ d@@ fast in the faith , kno@@ wing that the same aff@@ lic@@ tions are accomplished in your bre@@ th@@ ren that are in the world .
but the God of all grace , who hat@@ h called us un@@ to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , st@@ ab@@ lish , strengthen , settle you .
the church that is at Bab@@ yl@@ on , elected together with you , sal@@ u@@ te@@ th you ; and so do@@ th Mar@@ cus my son .
gre@@ et ye one another with a k@@ is@@ s of charity . peace be with you all that are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us . A@@ men .
Simon Peter , a ser@@ vant and an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , to them that have obtained like pre@@ ci@@ ous faith with us through the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God and our Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
according as his div@@ ine power hat@@ h given un@@ to us all things that per@@ tain un@@ to life and go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess , through the knowledge of him that hat@@ h called us to gl@@ ory and vir@@ tu@@ e :
and bes@@ ide this , giving all dil@@ ig@@ ence , add to your faith vir@@ tu@@ e ; and to vir@@ tu@@ e knowledge ;
for if these things be in you , and ab@@ ound , they make you that ye shall neither be bar@@ ren nor un@@ fruit@@ ful in the knowledge of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but he that la@@ c@@ ket@@ h these things is b@@ lin@@ d , and can@@ not see af@@ ar off , and hat@@ h forgotten that he was p@@ urged from his old sin@@ s .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the rather , bre@@ th@@ ren , give dil@@ ig@@ ence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
for so an entrance shall be minist@@ ered un@@ to you ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly into the ever@@ lasting k@@ ing@@ dom of our Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I will not be neg@@ lig@@ ent to put you always in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
Ye@@ a , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tab@@ ern@@ acle , to stir you up by putting you in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance ;
kno@@ wing that shortly I must put off this my tab@@ ern@@ acle , even as our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h she@@ wed me .
for we have not followed c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known un@@ to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
and this voice which came from heav@@ en we heard , when we were with him in the hol@@ y mount .
for the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came not in old time by the will of man : but hol@@ y men of God sp@@ ake as they were moved by the Holy gh@@ ost .
and many shall follow their per@@ nic@@ ious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be ev@@ il spoken of .
and through c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness shall they with fe@@ ig@@ ned words make mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lin@@ ger@@ eth not , and their dam@@ nation s@@ lum@@ ber@@ eth not .
for if God spar@@ ed not the an@@ gel@@ s that sin@@ ned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into cha@@ ins of d@@ ark@@ ness , to be reserved un@@ to judgment ;
and spar@@ ed not the old world , but sav@@ ed No@@ ah the eighth person , a pre@@ acher of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the un@@ go@@ dly ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an en@@ samp@@ le un@@ to those that after should live un@@ go@@ dly ;
( for that righ@@ te@@ ous man d@@ wel@@ ling among them , in seeing and hearing , v@@ ex@@ ed his righ@@ te@@ ous sou@@ l from day to day with their un@@ law@@ ful de@@ eds ; )
and shall receive the reward of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , as they that count it pleas@@ ure to riot in the day time . spots they are and ble@@ mis@@ hes , spor@@ ting themselves with their own dec@@ e@@ iv@@ ings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of ad@@ ul@@ tery , and that can@@ not ce@@ ase from sin ; be@@ guil@@ ing unstable so@@ ul@@ s : an heart they have exerc@@ ised with c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous practices ; Cur@@ sed children :
which have for@@ sak@@ en the right way , and are gone as@@ tra@@ y , following the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Bos@@ or , who lov@@ ed the wages of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
these are wel@@ ls without water , cl@@ ou@@ ds that are carried with a temp@@ est ; to whom the mist of d@@ ark@@ ness is reserved for ever .
for when they speak great s@@ wel@@ ling words of van@@ ity , they al@@ l@@ ure through the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , through much wan@@ ton@@ ness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in er@@ ror .
while they promise them liber@@ ty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bon@@ da@@ ge .
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led there@@ in , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the hol@@ y comman@@ d@@ ment delivered un@@ to them .
but it is happened un@@ to them according to the true pro@@ ver@@ b , The do@@ g is turned to his own v@@ om@@ it again ; and the so@@ w that was was@@ hed to her w@@ allowing in the m@@ ire .
that ye may be min@@ d@@ ful of the words which were spoken before by the hol@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of the comman@@ d@@ ment of us the A@@ post@@ les of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our :
for this they will@@ ingly are ignor@@ ant of , that by the word of God the heav@@ ens were of old , and the ear@@ th standing out of the water and in the water :
but the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved un@@ to fire against the day of judgment and per@@ di@@ tion of un@@ go@@ dly men .
but , bel@@ ov@@ ed , be not ignor@@ ant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not S@@ lack concerning his promise , as some men count sla@@ ck@@ ness ; but is long@@ suffering to us @@@ -@@ @ ward , not willing that any should per@@ ish , but that all should come to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heav@@ ens and a new ear@@ th , where@@ in d@@ wel@@ le@@ th righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , bel@@ ov@@ ed , seeing that ye look for such things , be dil@@ ig@@ ent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and bla@@ me@@ less .
and account that the long@@ suffering of our Lord is sal@@ vation ; even as our bel@@ ov@@ ed brother Paul also according to the wis@@ dom given un@@ to him hat@@ h written un@@ to you ;
Y@@ e therefore , bel@@ ov@@ ed , seeing ye know these things before , be@@ w@@ are lest ye also , being led away with the er@@ ror of the w@@ ic@@ ked , fall from your own ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ness .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Wor@@ d of life ;
that which we have seen and heard declare we un@@ to you , that ye also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us : and truly our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare un@@ to you , that God is light , and in him is no d@@ ark@@ ness at all .
if we say that we have fel@@ low@@ ship with him , and walk in d@@ ark@@ ness , we lie , and do not the truth :
if we say that we have no sin , we dec@@ e@@ ive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we conf@@ ess our sin@@ s , he is fa@@ ith@@ ful and just to for@@ give us our sin@@ s , and to cleans@@ e us from all un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
my little children , these things write I un@@ to you , that ye sin not . and if any man sin , we have an advocate with the F@@ ather , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist the righ@@ te@@ ous :
and he is the pro@@ p@@ iti@@ ation for our sin@@ s : and not for ours only , but also for the sin@@ s of the whole world .
and her@@ e@@ by we do know that we know him , if we keep his comman@@ d@@ ments .
he that sa@@ ith , I know him , and keep@@ eth not his comman@@ d@@ ments , is a li@@ ar , and the truth is not in him .
but wh@@ os@@ o keep@@ eth his word , in him veril@@ y is the love of God perf@@ ected : her@@ e@@ by know we that we are in him .
he that sa@@ ith he abi@@ de@@ th in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
Bre@@ th@@ ren , I write no new comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to you , but an old comman@@ d@@ ment which ye had from the beginning . the old comman@@ d@@ ment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
again , a new comman@@ d@@ ment I write un@@ to you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the d@@ ark@@ ness is past , and the true light now sh@@ in@@ eth .
he that sa@@ ith he is in the light , and ha@@ te@@ th his brother , is in d@@ ark@@ ness even until now .
he that lov@@ eth his brother abi@@ de@@ th in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
but he that ha@@ te@@ th his brother is in d@@ ark@@ ness , and walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and know@@ eth not w@@ hi@@ ther he go@@ eth , because that d@@ ark@@ ness hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded his eyes .
I write un@@ to you , little children , because your sin@@ s are for@@ given you for his name 's sake .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the F@@ ather is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , and the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the F@@ ather , but is of the world .
and the world pass@@ eth away , and the l@@ ust there@@ of : but he that do@@ eth the will of God abi@@ de@@ th for ever .
little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist shall come , even now are there many anti@@ ch@@ rist@@ s ; where@@ by we know that it is the last time .
but ye have an un@@ ction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written un@@ to you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
who is a li@@ ar but he that den@@ i@@ eth that J@@ es@@ us is the Ch@@ r@@ ist ? he is anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , that den@@ i@@ eth the F@@ ather and the Son .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever den@@ i@@ eth the Son , the same hat@@ h not the F@@ ather : ( but ) he that acknowled@@ get@@ h the Son hat@@ h the F@@ ather also .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be as@@ ha@@ med before him at his coming .
and ye know that he was manif@@ ested to take away our sin@@ s ; and in him is no sin .
he that commit@@ te@@ th sin is of the dev@@ il ; for the dev@@ il sin@@ net@@ h from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manif@@ ested , that he might destroy the works of the dev@@ il .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever is born of God do@@ th not commit sin ; for his se@@ ed remain@@ eth in him : and he can@@ not sin , because he is born of God .
in this the children of God are manif@@ est , and the children of the dev@@ il : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth not righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither he that lov@@ eth not his brother .
for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
not as C@@ ain , who was of that w@@ ic@@ ked one , and sle@@ w his brother . and where@@ fore sle@@ w he him ? because his own works were ev@@ il , and his brother 's righ@@ te@@ ous .
we know that we have passed from death un@@ to life , because we love the bre@@ th@@ ren . he that lov@@ eth not his brother abi@@ de@@ th in death .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever ha@@ te@@ th his brother is a mur@@ der@@ er : and ye know that no mur@@ der@@ er hat@@ h eter@@ nal life abi@@ ding in him .
Her@@ e@@ by perce@@ ive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the bre@@ th@@ ren .
but wh@@ os@@ o hat@@ h this world 's good , and se@@ eth his brother have need , and shut@@ te@@ th up his bo@@ wel@@ s of comp@@ as@@ sion from him , how d@@ wel@@ le@@ th the love of God in him ?
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in ton@@ gue ; but in de@@ ed and in truth .
and her@@ e@@ by we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hear@@ ts before him .
and this is his comman@@ d@@ ment , That we should believe on the name of his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and love one another , as he gave us comman@@ d@@ ment .
and he that keep@@ eth his comman@@ d@@ ments d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in him , and he in him . and her@@ e@@ by we know that he abi@@ de@@ th in us , by the Spiri@@ t which he hat@@ h given us .
Her@@ e@@ by know ye the Spiri@@ t of God : every spirit that conf@@ ess@@ eth that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is come in the f@@ les@@ h is of God :
Y@@ e are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that lov@@ eth is born of God , and know@@ eth God .
in this was manif@@ ested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only be@@ gotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
her@@ e@@ in is love , not that we lov@@ ed God , but that he lov@@ ed us , and sent his Son to be the pro@@ p@@ iti@@ ation for our sin@@ s .
no man hat@@ h seen God at any time . if we love one another , God d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in us , and his love is perf@@ ected in us .
Her@@ e@@ by know we that we d@@ well in him , and he in us , because he hat@@ h given us of his Spiri@@ t .
and we have seen and do testify that the F@@ ather sent the Son to be the Sav@@ i@@ our of the world .
and we have known and believed the love that God hat@@ h to us . God is love ; and he that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in love d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in God , and God in him .
her@@ e@@ in is our love made perfect , that we may have bol@@ d@@ ness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love cas@@ te@@ th out fear : because fear hat@@ h tor@@ ment . he that fear@@ eth is not made perfect in love .
if a man say , I love God , and ha@@ te@@ th his brother , he is a li@@ ar : for he that lov@@ eth not his brother whom he hat@@ h seen , how can he love God whom he hat@@ h not seen ?
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever believ@@ eth that J@@ es@@ us is the Ch@@ r@@ ist is born of God : and every one that lov@@ eth him that beg@@ at lov@@ eth him also that is be@@ gotten of him .
by this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments .
for this is the love of God , that we keep his comman@@ d@@ ments : and his comman@@ d@@ ments are not gri@@ ev@@ ous .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is born of God over@@ co@@ me@@ th the world : and this is the victory that over@@ co@@ me@@ th the world , even our faith .
who is he that over@@ co@@ me@@ th the world , but he that believ@@ eth that J@@ es@@ us is the Son of God ?
for there are three that bear record in heav@@ en , the F@@ ather , the Wor@@ d , and the Holy gh@@ ost : and these three are one .
and this is the record , that God hat@@ h given to us eter@@ nal life , and this life is in his Son .
he that hat@@ h the Son hat@@ h life ; and he that hat@@ h not the Son of God hat@@ h not life .
and this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he he@@ aret@@ h us :
and if we know that he hear us , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever we ask , we know that we have the peti@@ tions that we desi@@ red of him .
we know that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever is born of God sin@@ net@@ h not ; but he that is be@@ gotten of God keep@@ eth himself , and that w@@ ic@@ ked one tou@@ ch@@ eth him not .
the el@@ der un@@ to the elect la@@ dy and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
for the truth 's sake , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in us , and shall be with us for ever .
grace be with you , mer@@ cy , and peace , from God the F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of the F@@ ather , in truth and love .
I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed greatly that I found of TH@@ Y children walk@@ ing in truth , as we have received a comman@@ d@@ ment from the F@@ ather .
and now I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , la@@ dy , not as though I wrote a new comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to the@@ e , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
and this is love , that we walk after his comman@@ d@@ ments . this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
look to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that we lose not those things which we have w@@ rought , but that we receive a full reward .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever trans@@ gres@@ set@@ h , and abi@@ de@@ th not in the doc@@ tr@@ ine of Ch@@ r@@ ist , hat@@ h not God . he that abi@@ de@@ th in the doc@@ tr@@ ine of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he hat@@ h both the F@@ ather and the Son .
if there come any un@@ to you , and bring not this doc@@ tr@@ ine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
for I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed greatly , when the bre@@ th@@ ren came and testified of the truth that is in the@@ e , even as th@@ ou walk@@ est in the truth .
which have bor@@ ne witness of TH@@ Y charity before the church : whom if th@@ ou bring forward on their journey after a go@@ dly sort , th@@ ou s@@ halt do well :
Demetri@@ us hat@@ h good report of all men , and of the truth itself : ye@@ a , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and p@@ en write un@@ to the@@ e :
Ju@@ de , the ser@@ vant of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and brother of James , to them that are sanc@@ ti@@ fied by God the F@@ ather , and preserved in J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and called :
I will therefore put you in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having sav@@ ed the people out of the land of Egypt , after@@ ward destroyed them that believed not .
and the an@@ gel@@ s which kept not their first estate , but left their own habi@@ tation , he hat@@ h reserved in ever@@ lasting cha@@ ins under d@@ ark@@ ness un@@ to the judgment of the great day .
yet Michael the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , when conten@@ ding with the dev@@ il he disputed about the body of Mos@@ es , dur@@ st not bring against him a rail@@ ing accus@@ ation , but said , The Lord re@@ bu@@ ke the@@ e .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them ! for they have gone in the way of C@@ ain , and ran gre@@ edil@@ y after the er@@ ror of Bal@@ a@@ am for reward , and per@@ ished in the gain@@ saying of C@@ ore .
these are mur@@ mur@@ ers , compla@@ in@@ ers , walk@@ ing after their own lu@@ sts ; and their m@@ outh speak@@ eth great s@@ wel@@ ling words , having men 's persons in ad@@ mir@@ ation because of advantage .
keep yo@@ ur@@ selves in the love of God , looking for the mer@@ cy of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist un@@ to eter@@ nal life .
who b@@ are record of the word of God , and of the testimony of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and of all things that he saw .
b@@ les@@ sed is he that re@@ ade@@ th , and they that hear the words of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and keep those things which are written there@@ in : for the time is at hand .
be@@ hold , he co@@ me@@ th with cl@@ ou@@ ds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pi@@ er@@ ced him : and all kin@@ dre@@ ds of the ear@@ th shall wa@@ il because of him . even so , A@@ men .
I am Alpha and O@@ me@@ ga , the beginning and the ending , sa@@ ith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
I was in the Spiri@@ t on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a tr@@ ump@@ et ,
his head and his ha@@ ir@@ s were white like wo@@ ol , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a fla@@ me of fire ;
and his feet like un@@ to fine br@@ ass , as if they burned in a fur@@ n@@ ace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his m@@ outh went a sharp t@@ wo@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word : and his coun@@ tenance was as the sun sh@@ in@@ eth in his strength .
and when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . and he laid his right hand upon me , saying un@@ to me , Fe@@ ar not ; I am the first and the last :
write the things which th@@ ou h@@ ast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be her@@ e@@ after ;
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which th@@ ou sa@@ west in my right hand , and the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven churches : and the seven cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks which th@@ ou sa@@ west are the seven churches .
un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church of E@@ ph@@ es@@ us write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hol@@ de@@ th the seven stars in his right hand , who walk@@ eth in the mid@@ st of the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks ;
and h@@ ast bor@@ ne , and h@@ ast patience , and for my name 's sake h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured , and h@@ ast not fa@@ in@@ ted .
he that hat@@ h an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t sa@@ ith un@@ to the churches ; To him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the mid@@ st of the par@@ ad@@ ise of God .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Sm@@ yr@@ na write ; These things sa@@ ith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
he that hat@@ h an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t sa@@ ith un@@ to the churches ; He that over@@ co@@ me@@ th shall not be hurt of the second death .
and to the an@@ gel of the church in Per@@ gam@@ os write ; These things sa@@ ith he which hat@@ h the sharp s@@ word with two ed@@ ges ;
rep@@ ent ; or else I will come un@@ to the@@ e quickly , and will fight against them with the s@@ word of my m@@ outh .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write ; These things sa@@ ith the Son of God , who hat@@ h his eyes like un@@ to a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like fine br@@ ass ;
I know TH@@ Y works , and charity , and service , and faith , and TH@@ Y patience , and TH@@ Y works ; and the last to be more than the first .
be@@ hold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit ad@@ ul@@ tery with her into great tri@@ bu@@ lation , except they rep@@ ent of their de@@ eds .
be watch@@ ful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found TH@@ Y works perfect before God .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast a few names even in Sar@@ dis which have not def@@ iled their gar@@ ments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are wor@@ thy .
he that over@@ co@@ me@@ th , the same shall be clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and I will not blo@@ t out his name out of the book of life , but I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
be@@ hold , I come quickly : hold that fast which th@@ ou h@@ ast , that no man take TH@@ Y cro@@ wn .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans write ; These things sa@@ ith the A@@ men , the fa@@ ith@@ ful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
so then because th@@ ou art lu@@ ke@@ warm , and neither cold nor hot , I will sp@@ ue the@@ e out of my m@@ outh .
because th@@ ou say@@ est , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and know@@ est not that th@@ ou art w@@ ret@@ ched , and mis@@ er@@ able , and poor , and b@@ lin@@ d , and nak@@ ed :
to him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I grant to sit with me in my th@@ r@@ one , even as I also over@@ came , and am set down with my F@@ ather in his th@@ r@@ one .
and immediately I was in the spirit : and , be@@ hold , a th@@ r@@ one was set in heav@@ en , and one sat on the th@@ r@@ one .
and round about the th@@ r@@ one were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty el@@ ders sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and they had on their heads crow@@ ns of gold .
and out of the th@@ r@@ one proce@@ eded ligh@@ t@@ nings and th@@ under@@ ings and voices : and there were seven lam@@ ps of fire burning before the th@@ r@@ one , which are the seven spir@@ its of God .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the th@@ r@@ one a book written within and on the back@@ side , sealed with seven se@@ als .
and no man in heav@@ en , nor in ear@@ th , neither under the ear@@ th , was able to open the book , neither to look there@@ on .
and I we@@ pt much , because no man was found wor@@ thy to open and to read the book , neither to look there@@ on .
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the th@@ r@@ one .
and when he had taken the book , the four be@@ asts and four and twenty el@@ ders fell down before the lam@@ b , having every one of them har@@ ps , and golden vi@@ als full of o@@ do@@ urs , which are the pray@@ ers of sa@@ ints .
saying with a l@@ oud voice , wor@@ thy is the lam@@ b that was sla@@ in to receive power , and ri@@ ches , and wis@@ dom , and strength , and honour , and gl@@ ory , and b@@ les@@ sing .
and the four be@@ asts said , A@@ men . and the four and twenty el@@ ders fell down and wor@@ shi@@ pped him that li@@ vet@@ h for ever and ever .
and I saw when the lam@@ b opened one of the se@@ als , and I heard , as it were the no@@ ise of Th@@ under , one of the four be@@ asts saying , C@@ ome and see .
and I heard a voice in the mid@@ st of the four be@@ asts say , A measure of wheat for a pen@@ ny , and three measures of bar@@ ley for a pen@@ ny ; and see th@@ ou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fourth se@@ al , I heard the voice of the fourth be@@ ast say , C@@ ome and see .
and when he had opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of them that were sla@@ in for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and the stars of heav@@ en fell un@@ to the ear@@ th , even as a fi@@ g tree cas@@ te@@ th her un@@ ti@@ mely fig@@ s , when she is shaken of a m@@ igh@@ ty wind .
and the heav@@ en depar@@ ted as a s@@ cr@@ oll when it is rol@@ led together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
saying , Hur@@ t not the ear@@ th , neither the sea , nor the trees , ti@@ ll we have sealed the servants of our God in their fore@@ heads .
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and for@@ ty and four thousand of all the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
of the tri@@ be of J@@ uda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of As@@ er were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of N@@ ep@@ thal@@ im were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Man@@ ass@@ es were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of L@@ evi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of Z@@ ab@@ ul@@ on were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice , saying , sal@@ vation to our God which sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one , and un@@ to the lam@@ b .
and all the an@@ gel@@ s stood round about the th@@ r@@ one , and about the el@@ ders and the four be@@ asts , and fell before the th@@ r@@ one on their faces , and wor@@ shi@@ pped God ,
saying , A@@ men : b@@ les@@ sing , and gl@@ ory , and wis@@ dom , and Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and honour , and power , and might , be un@@ to our God for ever and ever . A@@ men .
and I said un@@ to him , S@@ ir , th@@ ou know@@ est . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tri@@ bu@@ lation , and have was@@ hed their rob@@ es , and made them white in the blood of the lam@@ b .
therefore are they before the th@@ r@@ one of God , and serve him day and night in his temp@@ le : and he that sit@@ te@@ th on the th@@ r@@ one shall d@@ well among them .
they shall hunger no more , neither thir@@ st any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
for the lam@@ b which is in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one shall fe@@ ed them , and shall lead them un@@ to living fo@@ un@@ tains of waters : and God shall wi@@ pe away all te@@ ars from their eyes .
and when he had opened the seventh se@@ al , there was sil@@ ence in heav@@ en about the space of half an hour .
and I saw the seven an@@ gel@@ s which stood before God ; and to them were given seven tr@@ ump@@ ets .
and the smoke of the incen@@ se , which came with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , as@@ cen@@ ded up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
the first an@@ gel so@@ unded , and there followed ha@@ il and fire min@@ g@@ led with blood , and they were cast upon the ear@@ th : and the third part of trees was bur@@ n@@ t up , and all green gr@@ ass was bur@@ n@@ t up .
and the second an@@ gel so@@ unded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and the third part of the cre@@ atures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the name of the star is called Wor@@ m@@ wood : and the third part of the waters became wor@@ m@@ wood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
and the fifth an@@ gel so@@ unded , and I saw a star fall from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th : and to him was given the key of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it .
and there came out of the smoke loc@@ ust@@ s upon the ear@@ th : and un@@ to them was given power , as the S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions of the ear@@ th have power .
and it was comman@@ ded them that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the se@@ al of God in their fore@@ heads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ mented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ p@@ ion , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
and the shap@@ es of the loc@@ ust@@ s were like un@@ to hor@@ ses prepared un@@ to battle ; and on their heads were as it were crow@@ ns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had ha@@ ir as the ha@@ ir of women , and their te@@ eth were as the te@@ eth of li@@ ons .
and they had bre@@ ast@@ plates , as it were bre@@ ast@@ plates of iron ; and the sound of their w@@ ings was as the sound of char@@ i@@ ots of many hor@@ ses running to battle .
and they had ta@@ ils like un@@ to S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and there were st@@ ings in their ta@@ ils : and their power was to hurt men five months .
and they had a king over them , which is the an@@ gel of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it , whose name in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue is Ab@@ add@@ on , but in the Greek ton@@ gue hat@@ h his name A@@ poll@@ yon .
and the sixth an@@ gel so@@ unded , and I heard a voice from the four hor@@ ns of the golden alt@@ ar which is before God ,
and the four an@@ gel@@ s were lo@@ os@@ ed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to s@@ lay the third part of men .
and the number of the army of the hor@@ se@@ men were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the bri@@ m@@ stone , which issued out of their m@@ ou@@ ths .
for their power is in their m@@ outh , and in their ta@@ ils : for their ta@@ ils were like un@@ to Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
neither re@@ pen@@ ted they of their murders , nor of their sor@@ cer@@ ies , nor of their for@@ nic@@ ation , nor of their the@@ fts .
and when the seven th@@ unders had ut@@ tered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heav@@ en saying un@@ to me , Se@@ al up those things which the seven th@@ unders ut@@ tered , and write them not .
and the an@@ gel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the ear@@ th lifted up his hand to heav@@ en ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh an@@ gel , when he shall begin to sound , the my@@ ster@@ y of God should be finished , as he hat@@ h declared to his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and the voice which I heard from heav@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to me again , and said , G@@ o and take the little book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel which stan@@ de@@ th upon the sea and upon the ear@@ th .
and I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my m@@ outh swe@@ et as hon@@ ey : and as soon as I had e@@ aten it , my bel@@ ly was bitter .
and there was given me a Re@@ ed like un@@ to a ro@@ d : and the an@@ gel stood , saying , R@@ ise , and measure the temp@@ le of God , and the alt@@ ar , and them that worship there@@ in .
but the court which is without the temp@@ le leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given un@@ to the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and the hol@@ y city shall they tre@@ ad under fo@@ ot for@@ ty and two months .
and I will give power un@@ to my two witnesses , and they shall pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core days , clo@@ th@@ ed in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th .
these are the two olive trees , and the two cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks standing before the God of the ear@@ th .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proce@@ ede@@ th out of their m@@ outh , and dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th their enem@@ ies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that as@@ cen@@ de@@ th out of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spir@@ itu@@ ally is called So@@ dom and Egypt , where also our Lord was cru@@ ci@@ fied .
and they of the people and kin@@ dre@@ ds and ton@@ gues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
and they that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th shall re@@ jo@@ ice over them , and make mer@@ ry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two pro@@ ph@@ ets tor@@ mented them that d@@ wel@@ t on the ear@@ th .
and after three days and an half the Spiri@@ t of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
and the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded ; and there were great voices in heav@@ en , saying , The k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of this world are become the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the temp@@ le of God was opened in heav@@ en , and there was seen in his temp@@ le the Ar@@ k of his test@@ am@@ ent : and there were ligh@@ t@@ nings , and voices , and th@@ under@@ ings , and an earthquake , and great ha@@ il .
and there appeared a great wonder in heav@@ en ; a woman clo@@ th@@ ed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a cro@@ wn of twelve stars :
and she being with child cri@@ ed , trav@@ ailing in birth , and pain@@ ed to be delivered .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a ro@@ d of iron : and her child was caught up un@@ to God , and to his th@@ r@@ one .
and the woman fled into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where she hat@@ h a place prepared of God , that they should fe@@ ed her there a thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core days .
and the great dra@@ g@@ on was cast out , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , called the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , which dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h the whole world : he was cast out into the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were cast out with him .
and they over@@ came him by the blood of the lam@@ b , and by the word of their testimony ; and they lov@@ ed not their lives un@@ to the death .
and when the dra@@ g@@ on saw that he was cast un@@ to the ear@@ th , he persec@@ uted the woman which brought forth the man child .
and the ser@@ p@@ ent cast out of his m@@ outh water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
and the ear@@ th helped the woman , and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed up the flood which the dra@@ g@@ on cast out of his m@@ outh .
and the dra@@ g@@ on was wro@@ th with the woman , and went to make war with the re@@ mn@@ ant of her se@@ ed , which keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of God , and have the testimony of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and I stood upon the s@@ and of the sea , and saw a be@@ ast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten hor@@ ns , and upon his hor@@ ns ten crow@@ ns , and upon his heads the name of b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y .
and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the dra@@ g@@ on which gave power un@@ to the be@@ ast : and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the be@@ ast , saying , Wh@@ o is like un@@ to the be@@ ast ? who is able to make war with him ?
and there was given un@@ to him a m@@ outh speaking great things and b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies ; and power was given un@@ to him to continue for@@ ty and two months .
and he opened his m@@ outh in b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y against God , to b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme his name , and his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and them that d@@ well in heav@@ en .
and it was given un@@ to him to make war with the sa@@ ints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kin@@ dre@@ ds , and ton@@ gues , and nations .
and all that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the lam@@ b sla@@ in from the foundation of the world .
he that le@@ ade@@ th into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kil@@ le@@ th with the s@@ word must be killed with the s@@ word . here is the patience and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
and he exerc@@ is@@ eth all the power of the first be@@ ast before him , and ca@@ us@@ eth the ear@@ th and them which d@@ well there@@ in to worship the first be@@ ast , whose deadly wo@@ und was he@@ aled .
and he do@@ eth great won@@ ders , so that he mak@@ eth fire come down from heav@@ en on the ear@@ th in the sight of men ,
and he ca@@ us@@ eth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their fore@@ heads :
here is wis@@ dom . let him that hat@@ h understanding count the number of the be@@ ast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Si@@ x hundred thre@@ es@@ core and six .
and I looked , and , lo , a lam@@ b stood on the mount S@@ ion , and with him an hundred for@@ ty and four thousand , having his F@@ ather 's name written in their fore@@ heads .
and I heard a voice from heav@@ en , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great Th@@ under : and I heard the voice of har@@ pers har@@ ping with their har@@ ps :
and in their m@@ outh was found no gu@@ ile : for they are without fault before the th@@ r@@ one of God .
and the smoke of their tor@@ ment as@@ cen@@ de@@ th up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever recei@@ vet@@ h the mark of his name .
here is the patience of the sa@@ ints : here are they that keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of God , and the faith of J@@ es@@ us .
and I looked , and be@@ hold a white cl@@ oud , and upon the cl@@ oud one sat like un@@ to the Son of man , having on his head a golden cro@@ wn , and in his hand a sharp si@@ ck@@ le .
and he that sat on the cl@@ oud th@@ rust in his si@@ ck@@ le on the ear@@ th ; and the ear@@ th was re@@ ap@@ ed .
and another an@@ gel came out of the temp@@ le which is in heav@@ en , he also having a sharp si@@ ck@@ le .
and the win@@ e@@ press was tro@@ dden without the city , and blood came out of the win@@ e@@ press , even un@@ to the hor@@ se bri@@ d@@ les , by the space of a thousand and six hundred fur@@ lon@@ gs .
and I saw another sign in heav@@ en , great and mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous , seven an@@ gel@@ s having the seven last plagu@@ es ; for in them is filled up the wr@@ ath of God .
and after that I looked , and , be@@ hold , the temp@@ le of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony in heav@@ en was opened :
and the seven an@@ gel@@ s came out of the temp@@ le , having the seven plagu@@ es , clo@@ th@@ ed in p@@ ure and white lin@@ en , and having their bre@@ asts gir@@ ded with golden gir@@ d@@ les .
and one of the four be@@ asts gave un@@ to the seven an@@ gel@@ s seven golden vi@@ als full of the wr@@ ath of God , who li@@ vet@@ h for ever and ever .
and the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temp@@ le , ti@@ ll the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s were fulfilled .
and I heard a great voice out of the temp@@ le saying to the seven an@@ gel@@ s , G@@ o your ways , and p@@ our out the vi@@ als of the wr@@ ath of God upon the ear@@ th .
and the first went , and p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the ear@@ th ; and there fell a no@@ is@@ ome and gri@@ ev@@ ous sor@@ e upon the men which had the mark of the be@@ ast , and upon them which wor@@ shi@@ pped his image .
and the second an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living sou@@ l died in the sea .
and the third an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the rivers and fo@@ un@@ tains of waters ; and they became blood .
and I heard the an@@ gel of the waters say , T@@ ho@@ u art righ@@ te@@ ous , O Lord , which art , and w@@ ast , and s@@ halt be , because th@@ ou h@@ ast jud@@ ged thus .
and the fourth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the sun ; and power was given un@@ to him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
and men were scor@@ ched with great heat , and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the name of God , which hat@@ h power over these plagu@@ es : and they re@@ pen@@ ted not to give him gl@@ ory .
and the fifth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the seat of the be@@ ast ; and his k@@ ing@@ dom was full of d@@ ark@@ ness ; and they gn@@ a@@ wed their ton@@ gues for p@@ ain ,
and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the God of heav@@ en because of their pain@@ s and their so@@ res , and re@@ pen@@ ted not of their de@@ eds .
and the sixth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the great river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates ; and the water there@@ of was dri@@ ed up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three un@@ clean spir@@ its like fro@@ gs come out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t .
for they are the spir@@ its of dev@@ ils , working mir@@ ac@@ les , which go forth un@@ to the kings of the ear@@ th and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
be@@ hold , I come as a th@@ i@@ ef . b@@ les@@ sed is he that watch@@ eth , and keep@@ eth his gar@@ ments , lest he walk nak@@ ed , and they see his sh@@ ame .
and the seventh an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temp@@ le of heav@@ en , from the th@@ r@@ one , saying , It is done .
and there came one of the seven an@@ gel@@ s which had the seven vi@@ als , and talked with me , saying un@@ to me , C@@ ome hi@@ ther ; I will she@@ w un@@ to the@@ e the judgment of the great wh@@ ore that sit@@ te@@ th upon many waters :
with whom the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation , and the inhabitants of the ear@@ th have been made dr@@ un@@ k with the wine of her for@@ nic@@ ation .
and the woman was ar@@ ray@@ ed in pur@@ ple and scar@@ let col@@ our , and dec@@ ked with gold and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones and pe@@ ar@@ ls , having a golden c@@ up in her hand full of ab@@ omin@@ ations and fil@@ th@@ iness of her for@@ nic@@ ation :
and upon her fore@@ head was a name written , my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of H@@ AR@@ L@@ O@@ T@@ S and AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth .
and I saw the woman dr@@ un@@ ken with the blood of the sa@@ ints , and with the blood of the m@@ art@@ yr@@ s of J@@ es@@ us : and when I saw her , I won@@ dered with great ad@@ mir@@ ation .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he co@@ me@@ th , he must continue a short space .
and the be@@ ast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and go@@ eth into per@@ di@@ tion .
and the ten hor@@ ns which th@@ ou sa@@ west are ten kings , which have received no k@@ ing@@ dom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the be@@ ast .
and the ten hor@@ ns which th@@ ou sa@@ west upon the be@@ ast , these shall h@@ ate the wh@@ ore , and shall make her de@@ so@@ late and nak@@ ed , and shall eat her f@@ les@@ h , and bur@@ n her with fire .
for God hat@@ h put in their hear@@ ts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their k@@ ing@@ dom un@@ to the be@@ ast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
and the woman which th@@ ou sa@@ west is that great city , which re@@ ig@@ net@@ h over the kings of the ear@@ th .
and after these things I saw another an@@ gel come down from heav@@ en , having great power ; and the ear@@ th was ligh@@ tened with his gl@@ ory .
for all nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her for@@ nic@@ ation , and the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th are wa@@ xed rich through the ab@@ und@@ ance of her de@@ lic@@ acies .
and I heard another voice from heav@@ en , saying , C@@ ome out of her , my people , that ye be not par@@ tak@@ ers of her sin@@ s , and that ye receive not of her plagu@@ es .
reward her even as she re@@ warded you , and double un@@ to her double according to her works : in the c@@ up which she hat@@ h filled fill to her double .
therefore shall her plagu@@ es come in one day , death , and mourning , and fam@@ ine ; and she shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who jud@@ get@@ h her .
and the kings of the ear@@ th , who have committed for@@ nic@@ ation and lived deli@@ ci@@ ously with her , shall be@@ wa@@ il her , and la@@ ment for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
standing af@@ ar off for the fear of her tor@@ ment , saying , A@@ las , al@@ as , that great city Bab@@ yl@@ on , that m@@ igh@@ ty city ! for in one hour is TH@@ Y judgment come .
and the fru@@ its that TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ ted after are depar@@ ted from the@@ e , and all things which were da@@ in@@ ty and good@@ ly are depar@@ ted from the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt find them no more at all .
the mer@@ chan@@ ts of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand af@@ ar off for the fear of her tor@@ ment , we@@ eping and w@@ ailing ,
and a m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Th@@ us with violence shall that great city Bab@@ yl@@ on be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and in her was found the blood of pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of sa@@ ints , and of all that were sla@@ in upon the ear@@ th .
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments : for he hat@@ h jud@@ ged the great wh@@ ore , which did corrupt the ear@@ th with her for@@ nic@@ ation , and hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and a voice came out of the th@@ r@@ one , saying , P@@ raise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
let us be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the lam@@ b is come , and his wife hat@@ h made her@@ self ready .
and to her was granted that she should be ar@@ ray@@ ed in fine lin@@ en , clean and white : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of sa@@ ints .
and I saw heav@@ en opened , and be@@ hold a white hor@@ se ; and he that sat upon him was called fa@@ ith@@ ful and Tru@@ e , and in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness he do@@ th judge and make war .
his eyes were as a fla@@ me of fire , and on his head were many crow@@ ns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
and he was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ves@@ ture di@@ pped in blood : and his name is called The Wor@@ d of God .
and he hat@@ h on his ves@@ ture and on his th@@ igh a name written , King of K@@ ings , and Lord of lor@@ ds .
and I saw the be@@ ast , and the kings of the ear@@ th , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the hor@@ se , and against his army .
and I saw an an@@ gel come down from heav@@ en , having the key of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it and a great chain in his hand .
and he laid hold on the dra@@ g@@ on , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , which is the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , and bound him a thousand years ,
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . this is the first resur@@ rec@@ tion .
b@@ les@@ sed and hol@@ y is he that hat@@ h part in the first resur@@ rec@@ tion : on such the second death hat@@ h no power , but they shall be pri@@ ests of God and of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and when the thousand years are expired , S@@ atan shall be lo@@ os@@ ed out of his prison ,
and shall go out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four quarters of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
and I saw a great white th@@ r@@ one , and him that sat on it , from whose face the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were jud@@ ged every man according to their works .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
and I saw a new heav@@ en and a new ear@@ th : for the first heav@@ en and the first ear@@ th were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
and I John saw the hol@@ y city , new Jer@@ usalem , coming down from God out of heav@@ en , prepared as a bri@@ de ad@@ or@@ ned for her husband .
and God shall wi@@ pe away all te@@ ars from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sor@@ row , nor cr@@ ying , neither shall there be any more p@@ ain : for the former things are passed away .
on the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
and he that talked with me had a golden Re@@ ed to measure the city , and the gates there@@ of , and the wall there@@ of .
and the city li@@ eth fo@@ ur@@ square , and the length is as large as the b@@ read@@ th : and he meas@@ ured the city with the Re@@ ed , twelve thousand fur@@ lon@@ gs . the length and the b@@ read@@ th and the he@@ ight of it are equal .
and he meas@@ ured the wall there@@ of , an hundred and for@@ ty and four cu@@ bi@@ ts , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the an@@ gel .
and the building of the wall of it was of j@@ as@@ per : and the city was p@@ ure gold , like un@@ to clear glass .
and the twelve gates were twelve pe@@ ar@@ ls ; every several gate was of one pe@@ ar@@ l : and the street of the city was p@@ ure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to sh@@ ine in it : for the gl@@ ory of God did ligh@@ ten it , and the lam@@ b is the light there@@ of .
