and A@@ dam gave names to all c@@ attle , and to the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and to every be@@ ast of the field ; but for A@@ dam there was not found an help meet for him .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were nak@@ ed ; and they se@@ wed fi@@ g leaves together , and made themselves ap@@ r@@ ons .
and I will put en@@ mity between the@@ e and the woman , and between TH@@ Y se@@ ed and her se@@ ed ; it shall bru@@ ise TH@@ Y head , and th@@ ou s@@ halt bru@@ ise his he@@ el .
and they said , G@@ o to , let us build us a city and a to@@ wer , whose top may reach un@@ to heav@@ en ; and let us make us a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad upon the face of the whole ear@@ th .
then lot chose him all the pla@@ in of Jordan ; and lot jour@@ ne@@ yed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
and it came to pass the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dig@@ ged , and said un@@ to him , We have found water .
and I@@ sa@@ ac sent away Jac@@ o@@ b : and he went to P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am un@@ to Lab@@ an , son of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian , the brother of Re@@ bek@@ ah , Jac@@ o@@ b 's and E@@ sa@@ u 's mother .
and Jac@@ o@@ b be@@ held the coun@@ tenance of Lab@@ an , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
whereas th@@ ou h@@ ast searched all my stu@@ ff , what h@@ ast th@@ ou found of all TH@@ Y household stu@@ ff ? set it here before my bre@@ th@@ ren and TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , that they may judge bet@@ wi@@ xt us both .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say , They be TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b 's ; it is a present sent un@@ to my lor@@ d E@@ sa@@ u : and , be@@ hold , also he is behind us .
and he passed over before them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
only her@@ e@@ in will the men consent un@@ to us for to d@@ well with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
and O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in un@@ to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest that he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
and he asked P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's officers that were with him in the ward of his lor@@ d 's house , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore look ye so sad@@ ly to day ?
then Joseph comman@@ ded to fill their s@@ acks with cor@@ n , and to restore every man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he un@@ to them .
and bring your youngest brother un@@ to me : then shall I know that ye are no sp@@ ies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffic@@ k in the land .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant became su@@ re@@ ty for the la@@ d un@@ to my father , saying , If I bring him not un@@ to the@@ e , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cri@@ ed , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
to all of them he gave each man changes of ra@@ im@@ ent ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of ra@@ im@@ ent .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten ass@@ es la@@ den with the good things of Egypt , and ten she ass@@ es la@@ den with cor@@ n and bread and meat for his father by the way .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said un@@ to them : and when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b their father revi@@ ved :
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b their father , and their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
and Joseph fell upon his father 's face , and we@@ pt upon him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that went up with him to bur@@ y his father , after he had buried his father .
and it came to pass , because the M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves fear@@ ed God , that he made them houses .
go ye , get you stra@@ w where ye can find it : yet not ought of your work shall be dimin@@ ished .
there is no stra@@ w given un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , and they say to us , Mak@@ e bri@@ ck : and , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in ev@@ il case , after it was said , Y@@ e shall not min@@ ish ought from your bri@@ cks of your daily task .
and when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that the rain and the ha@@ il and the th@@ unders were ce@@ ased , he sin@@ ned yet more , and har@@ dened his heart , he and his servants .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Y@@ et will I bring one pla@@ gue more upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall su@@ rely th@@ rust you out hence altogether .
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
and in the first day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
then Mos@@ es called for all the el@@ ders of Israel , and said un@@ to them , Dra@@ w out and take you a lam@@ b according to your families , and kill the pass@@ over .
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
he that sm@@ ite@@ th a man , so that he die , shall be su@@ rely put to death .
if th@@ ou meet th@@ ine enemy 's o@@ x or his ass going as@@ tra@@ y , th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely bring it back to him again .
and there shall be a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt gir@@ d them with gir@@ d@@ les , Aaron and his sons , and put the bon@@ n@@ ets on them : and the pri@@ est 's office shall be the@@ ir@@ s for a perpet@@ ual statute : and th@@ ou s@@ halt consec@@ rate Aaron and his sons .
and the hol@@ y gar@@ ments of Aaron shall be his sons ' after him , to be ano@@ in@@ ted there@@ in , and to be consec@@ rated in them .
and as for the perf@@ ume which th@@ ou s@@ halt make , ye shall not make to yo@@ ur@@ selves according to the composition there@@ of : it shall be un@@ to the@@ e hol@@ y for the Lord .
for Mos@@ es had said , Con@@ sec@@ rate yo@@ ur@@ selves to day to the Lord , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bes@@ to@@ w upon you a b@@ les@@ sing this day .
and Mos@@ es returned un@@ to the Lord , and said , O@@ h , this people have sin@@ ned a great sin , and have made them go@@ ds of gold .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es came down from mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tables of testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Mos@@ es w@@ ist not that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one while he talked with him .
and Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise hear@@ ted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wis@@ dom , even every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come un@@ to the work to do it :
and he made the cand@@ le@@ stick of p@@ ure gold : of beaten work made he the cand@@ le@@ stick ; his S@@ haf@@ t , and his branch , his bo@@ w@@ ls , his k@@ n@@ ops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made the incen@@ se alt@@ ar of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : the length of it was a cu@@ bit , and the b@@ read@@ th of it a cu@@ bit ; it was fo@@ ur@@ square ; and two cu@@ bi@@ ts was the he@@ ight of it ; the hor@@ ns there@@ of were of the same .
which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es in mount S@@ ina@@ i , in the day that he comman@@ ded the children of Israel to offer their ob@@ lations un@@ to the Lord , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
and Mos@@ es brought Aaron 's sons , and put co@@ ats upon them , and gir@@ ded them with gir@@ d@@ les , and put bon@@ n@@ ets upon them ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
Aaron therefore went un@@ to the alt@@ ar , and sle@@ w the cal@@ f of the sin offering , which was for himself .
for I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , and ye shall be hol@@ y ; for I am hol@@ y : neither shall ye def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his ha@@ ir off his head and his be@@ ard and his eye@@ bro@@ ws , even all his ha@@ ir he shall s@@ have off : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , also he shall was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h in water , and he shall be clean .
and the pri@@ est shall take some of the lo@@ g of oil , and p@@ our it into the pal@@ m of his own left hand :
and the pri@@ est shall p@@ our of the oil into the pal@@ m of his own left hand :
and Aaron shall offer his bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house .
and Aaron shall bring the bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bul@@ lock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation when he go@@ eth in to make an At@@ on@@ ement in the hol@@ y place , until he come out , and have made an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his household , and for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
and he shall was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h with water in the hol@@ y place , and put on his gar@@ ments , and come forth , and offer his bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the bur@@ n@@ t offering of the people , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for the people .
and he that let go the go@@ at for the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward come into the camp .
and he that bur@@ net@@ h them shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp .
for the life of the f@@ les@@ h is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the alt@@ ar to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s : for it is the blood that mak@@ eth an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not un@@ cover the nak@@ edn@@ ess of a woman and her daughter , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; for they are her near k@@ ins@@ women : it is w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
and the man that commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery with another man 's wife , even he that commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery with his neighbour 's wife , the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ er and the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ess shall su@@ rely be put to death .
and the daughter of any pri@@ est , if she prof@@ ane her@@ self by playing the wh@@ ore , she prof@@ an@@ eth her father : she shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire .
and if a man cause a ble@@ mis@@ h in his neighbour ; as he hat@@ h done , so shall it be done to him ;
breach for breach , eye for eye , to@@ o@@ th for to@@ o@@ th : as he hat@@ h caused a ble@@ mis@@ h in a man , so shall it be done to him again .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the L@@ evi@@ tes re@@ de@@ em at any time .
and if TH@@ Y brother that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th by the@@ e be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and be sold un@@ to the@@ e ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not comp@@ el him to serve as a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant :
and I will bring a s@@ word upon you , that shall av@@ en@@ ge the quar@@ rel of my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments and laws , which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount S@@ ina@@ i by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and every man 's hal@@ low@@ ed things shall be his : wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever any man gi@@ vet@@ h the pri@@ est , it shall be his .
and the pri@@ est shall set the woman before the Lord , and un@@ cover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering : and the pri@@ est shall have in his hand the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se :
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vo@@ w a vo@@ w of a N@@ azar@@ ite , to separate themselves un@@ to the Lord :
all the days of the vo@@ w of his separation there shall no ras@@ or come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separ@@ ate@@ th himself un@@ to the Lord , he shall be hol@@ y , and shall let the loc@@ ks of the ha@@ ir of his head grow .
all the days that he separ@@ ate@@ th himself un@@ to the Lord he shall come at no dead body .
he shall not make himself un@@ clean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consec@@ ration of his God is upon his head .
and he shall consec@@ rate un@@ to the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lam@@ b of the first year for a t@@ res@@ pass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was def@@ iled .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified , and they was@@ hed their clo@@ th@@ es ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord ; and Aaron made an At@@ on@@ ement for them to cleans@@ e them .
but shall minister with their bre@@ th@@ ren in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes tou@@ ching their charge .
and he said , He@@ ar now my words : if there be a pro@@ phe@@ t among you , I the Lord will make myself known un@@ to him in a vision , and will speak un@@ to him in a dream .
but the men that went up with him said , We be not able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we .
and there we saw the gi@@ ants , the sons of An@@ ak , which come of the gi@@ ants : and we were in our own sight as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , and so we were in their sight .
and they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt .
this do ; T@@ ake you cen@@ s@@ ers , Kor@@ ah , and all his company ;
and ships shall come from the coast of Ch@@ it@@ tim , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t As@@ sh@@ ur , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t E@@ ber , and he also shall per@@ ish for ever .
and he shall have it , and his se@@ ed after him , even the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of an ever@@ lasting pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; because he was z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for his God , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the children of Israel .
if a man vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , or swe@@ ar an oath to bin@@ d his sou@@ l with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proce@@ ede@@ th out of his m@@ outh .
if a woman also vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and bin@@ d her@@ self by a bond , being in her father 's house in her youth ;
and her father hear her vo@@ w , and her bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her father dis@@ allow her in the day that he he@@ aret@@ h ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , shall stand : and the Lord shall for@@ give her , because her father dis@@ allowed her .
and if she had at all an husband , when she vowed , or ut@@ tered ought out of her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her husband dis@@ allowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vo@@ w which she vowed , and that which she ut@@ tered with her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l , of none effect : and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but every vo@@ w of a wi@@ dow , and of her that is div@@ or@@ ced , where@@ with they have bound their so@@ ul@@ s , shall stand against her .
and if she vowed in her husband 's house , or bound her sou@@ l by a bond with an oath ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and dis@@ allowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her husband hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly made them vo@@ id on the day he heard them ; then wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever proce@@ eded out of her li@@ ps concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her sou@@ l , shall not stand : her husband hat@@ h made them vo@@ id ; and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
every vo@@ w , and every binding oath to aff@@ lic@@ t the sou@@ l , her husband may establish it , or her husband may make it vo@@ id .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h killed any person , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h touched any sla@@ in , pur@@ ify both yo@@ ur@@ selves and your cap@@ tives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tri@@ bes , and I will make them rul@@ ers over you .
your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : for all the men that followed Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h destroyed them from among you .
take ye therefore good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for ye saw no manner of si@@ milit@@ u@@ de on the day that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in Ho@@ re@@ b out of the mid@@ st of the fire :
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
know therefore that the Lord TH@@ Y God , he is God , the fa@@ ith@@ ful God , which keep@@ eth C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and mer@@ cy with them that love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments to a thousand generations ;
and re@@ pay@@ eth them that h@@ ate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be S@@ lack to him that ha@@ te@@ th him , he will repay him to his face .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , ye had sin@@ ned against the Lord your God , and had made you a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had comman@@ ded you .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
and it shall be , when he sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
that his heart be not lifted up above his bre@@ th@@ ren , and that he turn not aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he , and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
therefore shall they have no inher@@ it@@ ance among their bre@@ th@@ ren : the Lord is their inher@@ it@@ ance , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to them .
the Lord TH@@ Y God will raise up un@@ to the@@ e a Pro@@ phe@@ t from the mid@@ st of the@@ e , of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; un@@ to him ye shall he@@ arken ;
I will raise them up a Pro@@ phe@@ t from among their bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to the@@ e , and will put my words in his m@@ outh ; and he shall speak un@@ to them all that I shall command him .
when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h cut off the nations , whose land the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their cities , and in their houses ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt separate three cities for the@@ e .
and the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi shall come near ; for them the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to minister un@@ to him , and to b@@ less in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stro@@ ke be tried :
and se@@ est among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and h@@ ast a desire un@@ to her , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest have her to TH@@ Y wife ;
if a man have two wi@@ ves , one bel@@ ov@@ ed , and another ha@@ ted , and they have born him children , both the bel@@ ov@@ ed and the ha@@ ted ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers that was ha@@ ted :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt stand abroad , and the man to whom th@@ ou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad un@@ to the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast av@@ ou@@ ched the Lord this day to be TH@@ Y God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his judg@@ ments , and to he@@ arken un@@ to his voice :
and to make the@@ e high above all nations which he hat@@ h made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that th@@ ou may@@ est be an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , as he hat@@ h spoken .
the Lord shall establish the@@ e an hol@@ y people un@@ to himself , as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to the@@ e , if th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and walk in his ways .
then men shall say , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
for they went and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them , go@@ ds whom they knew not , and whom he had not given un@@ to them :
and the Lord , he it is that do@@ th go before the@@ e ; he will be with the@@ e , he will not fail the@@ e , neither for@@ sake the@@ e : fear not , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
and they went , and came un@@ to the mountain , and abo@@ de there three days , until the pursu@@ ers were returned : and the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tri@@ bes of Israel , out of every tri@@ be a man .
and the young men that were sp@@ ies went in , and brought Ra@@ ha@@ b , and her father , and her mother , and her bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kin@@ d@@ red , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accur@@ sed thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he hat@@ h : because he hat@@ h trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and because he hat@@ h w@@ rought Fol@@ ly in Israel .
and Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning , and num@@ ber@@ ed the people , and went up , he and the el@@ ders of Israel , before the people to A@@ I .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where@@ in they ch@@ ased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes returned un@@ to A@@ I , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word .
they did work w@@ il@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their ass@@ es , and wine bott@@ les , old , and rent , and bound up ;
the Lord also sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord , What t@@ res@@ pass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have buil@@ ded you an alt@@ ar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
is the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we are not cleans@@ ed until this day , although there was a pla@@ gue in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord ,
therefore we said , Let us now prepare to build us an alt@@ ar , not for bur@@ n@@ t offering , nor for sacrifice :
now therefore put away , said he , the st@@ range go@@ ds which are among you , and inc@@ line your heart un@@ to the Lord God of Israel .
and they for@@ so@@ ok the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the people that were round about them , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them , and provoked the Lord to an@@ ger .
but E@@ h@@ ud made him a da@@ g@@ ger which had two ed@@ ges , of a cu@@ bit length ; and he did gir@@ d it under his ra@@ im@@ ent upon his right th@@ igh .
and the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel : and because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and c@@ aves , and strong holds .
and G@@ ide@@ on said , T@@ her@@ e@@ fore when the Lord hat@@ h delivered Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na into mine hand , then I will tear your f@@ les@@ h with the thor@@ ns of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and with bri@@ ers .
and the children of Israel remember@@ ed not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enem@@ ies on every side :
the trees went forth on a time to ano@@ int a king over them ; and they said un@@ to the olive tree , reign th@@ ou over us .
and he said un@@ to them , Th@@ us and thus deal@@ eth Mic@@ ah with me , and hat@@ h hired me , and I am his pri@@ est .
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back un@@ to his house .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Lev@@ ite so@@ jour@@ ning on the side of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , who took to him a conc@@ ub@@ ine out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h .
yet there is both stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for our ass@@ es ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id , and for the young man which is with TH@@ Y servants : there is no want of any thing .
and they took them wi@@ ves of the women of Mo@@ a@@ b ; the name of the one was Or@@ p@@ ah , and the name of the other R@@ ut@@ h : and they d@@ wel@@ led there about ten years .
and she went , and came , and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and her ha@@ p was to light on a part of the field belonging un@@ to Bo@@ az , who was of the kin@@ d@@ red of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Wh@@ o art th@@ ou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
so Bo@@ az took R@@ ut@@ h , and she was his wife : and when he went in un@@ to her , the Lord gave her concep@@ tion , and she b@@ are a son .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him un@@ to the house of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h : and the child was young .
and there came a man of God un@@ to E@@ li , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , did I pla@@ in@@ ly appear un@@ to the house of TH@@ Y father , when they were in Egypt in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ?
now therefore he@@ arken un@@ to their voice : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it yet protest so@@ lem@@ n@@ ly un@@ to them , and she@@ w them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the Lord un@@ to the people that asked of him a king .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and , be@@ hold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and Samuel said , When th@@ ou w@@ ast little in th@@ ine own sight , w@@ ast th@@ ou not made the head of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the Lord ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e king over Israel ?
so David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ram@@ ah , and told him all that Sa@@ ul had done to him . and he and Samuel went and d@@ wel@@ t in N@@ ai@@ o@@ th .
if TH@@ Y father at all mis@@ s me , then say , David ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly asked leave of me that he might run to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem his city : for there is a ye@@ arly sacrifice there for all the family .
and Jon@@ athan said , F@@ ar be it from the@@ e : for if I knew certainly that ev@@ il were determined by my father to come upon the@@ e , then would not I tell it the@@ e ?
then Sa@@ ul said un@@ to his servants that stood about him , He@@ ar now , ye Benj@@ am@@ ites ; will the son of J@@ es@@ se give every one of you fields and v@@ ine@@ yards , and make you all cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds ;
and David knew that Sa@@ ul secre@@ tly practi@@ sed mis@@ chief against him ; and he said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , Br@@ ing hi@@ ther the ep@@ ho@@ d .
David said furthermore , As the Lord li@@ vet@@ h , the Lord shall sm@@ ite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall des@@ cen@@ d into battle , and per@@ ish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . and Sa@@ ul had put away those that had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
and when his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er saw that Sa@@ ul was dead , he fell likewise upon his s@@ word , and died with him .
and David said un@@ to the young man that told him , Ho@@ w know@@ est th@@ ou that Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son be dead ?
and David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that he had ex@@ al@@ ted his k@@ ing@@ dom for his people Israel 's sake .
and David took him more conc@@ ub@@ ines and wi@@ ves out of Jer@@ usalem , after he was come from He@@ br@@ on : and there were yet sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters born to David .
and I will yet be more v@@ ile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the ma@@ id@@ servants which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
and it came to pass after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ ses , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
then Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ex@@ al@@ ted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore Na@@ than sp@@ ake un@@ to B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba the mother of Solomon , saying , H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard that Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h do@@ th reign , and David our lor@@ d know@@ eth it not ?
and the king sent and called for Shi@@ me@@ i , and said un@@ to him , Bu@@ ild the@@ e an house in Jer@@ usalem , and d@@ well there , and go not forth th@@ ence any w@@ hi@@ ther .
but Solomon was building his own house thir@@ teen years , and he finished all his house .
and there were four under@@ set@@ ters to the four cor@@ ners of one base : and the under@@ set@@ ters were of the very base itself .
for they be TH@@ Y people , and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test forth out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron :
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter came up out of the city of David un@@ to her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Mil@@ lo .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I will not ren@@ d away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but will give one tri@@ be to TH@@ Y son for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was come again , that they sent and called him un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
but h@@ ast done ev@@ il above all that were before the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast gone and made the@@ e other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and h@@ ast cast me behind TH@@ Y back :
for they also built them high places , and images , and gro@@ ves , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
and he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the Lord his God give him a lam@@ p in Jer@@ usalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jer@@ usalem :
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
but Om@@ ri w@@ rought ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord , and did worse than all that were before him .
and A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him .
and A@@ ha@@ b made a gro@@ ve ; and A@@ ha@@ b did more to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
and the servants of the king of Syria said un@@ to him , The@@ ir go@@ ds are go@@ ds of the hil@@ ls ; therefore they were stronger than we ; but let us fight against them in the pla@@ in , and su@@ rely we shall be stronger than they .
but there was none like un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b , which did sell himself to work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord , whom J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel his wife s@@ tir@@ red up .
and the king of Israel said un@@ to J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , did I not tell the@@ e that he would pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y no good concerning me , but ev@@ il ?
and when they came down to him , E@@ lis@@ ha pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , Sm@@ ite this people , I pra@@ y the@@ e , with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness . and he smo@@ te them with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness according to the word of E@@ lis@@ ha .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
and they left all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made a gro@@ ve , and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served Ba@@ al .
and they caused their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and en@@ chan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
he tr@@ usted in the Lord God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor any that were before him .
for I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
and I will add un@@ to TH@@ Y days fif@@ teen years ; and I will deliver the@@ e and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sahi@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
and they sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he sp@@ ake kin@@ dly to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings that were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
and when Az@@ ub@@ ah was dead , Cal@@ e@@ b took un@@ to him E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath , which b@@ are him H@@ ur .
and when his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er saw that Sa@@ ul was dead , he fell likewise on the s@@ word , and died .
and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his k@@ ing@@ dom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
and David took more wi@@ ves at Jer@@ usalem : and David beg@@ at more sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the Ar@@ k of God , and pit@@ ched for it a tent .
then David said , N@@ one ought to carry the Ar@@ k of God but the L@@ evi@@ tes : for them hat@@ h the Lord chosen to carry the Ar@@ k of God , and to minister un@@ to him for ever .
at that time when David saw that the Lord had answ@@ ered him in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , then he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there .
now , my son , the Lord be with the@@ e ; and prosp@@ er th@@ ou , and build the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God , as he hat@@ h said of the@@ e .
and he said un@@ to me , Solomon TH@@ Y son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
and Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord , and an house for his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and Solomon sent to Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re , saying , As th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st deal with David my father , and di@@ d@@ st send him c@@ ed@@ ars to build him an house to d@@ well there@@ in , even so deal with me .
then hear th@@ ou from the heav@@ ens , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y people Israel , and bring them again un@@ to the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est to them and to their fa@@ thers .
and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said un@@ to him , I have heard TH@@ Y pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak : for your work shall be re@@ warded .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
for the eyes of the Lord run to and f@@ ro throughout the whole ear@@ th , to she@@ w himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : therefore from hen@@ ce@@ forth th@@ ou s@@ halt have wars .
and he placed forces in all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
and next him was A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself un@@ to the Lord ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and the king of Israel said to J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , did I not tell the@@ e that he would not pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y good un@@ to me , but ev@@ il ?
and he set judges in the land throughout all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , city by city ,
and after this did J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h join himself with A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Israel , who did very w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly :
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the Lord 's people .
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
now it came to pass , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se un@@ to them .
and he sought God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosp@@ er .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temp@@ le of the Lord to bur@@ n incen@@ se upon the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
but H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah ren@@ dered not again according to the benefit done un@@ to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wr@@ ath upon him , and upon Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
moreover he provided him cities , and pos@@ sessions of f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds in ab@@ und@@ ance : for God had given him sub@@ stance very much .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to TH@@ Y servants , they do it .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
and the ar@@ chers shot at king Jos@@ i@@ ah ; and the king said to his servants , H@@ ave me away ; for I am sor@@ e wounded .
his servants therefore took him out of that char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had ; and they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of his fa@@ thers . and all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
and he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart from turning un@@ to the Lord God of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , The Lord God of heav@@ en hat@@ h given me all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th ; and he hat@@ h charged me to build him an house at Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and came again un@@ to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified together , all of them were p@@ ure , and killed the pass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
for E@@ z@@ ra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments .
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have min@@ g@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers hat@@ h been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass .
and that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever would not come within three days , according to the coun@@ sel of the pr@@ inces and the el@@ ders , all his sub@@ stance should be for@@ fe@@ ited , and himself separated from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of those that had been carried away .
now these are TH@@ Y servants and TH@@ Y people , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed by TH@@ Y great power , and by TH@@ Y strong hand .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and came again to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared un@@ to them .
Ye@@ a , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , This is TH@@ Y God that brought the@@ e up out of Egypt , and had w@@ rought great provoc@@ ations ;
and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes pur@@ ified themselves , and pur@@ ified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
and Es@@ ther answ@@ ered , If it seem good un@@ to the king , let the king and Ham@@ an come this day un@@ to the ban@@ qu@@ et that I have prepared for him .
nevertheless Ham@@ an ref@@ ra@@ ined himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and Zer@@ es@@ h his wife .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
shall mort@@ al man be more just than God ? shall a man be more p@@ ure than his maker ?
no doubt but ye are the people , and wis@@ dom shall die with you .
the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of rob@@ bers prosp@@ er , and they that prov@@ oke God are secure ; into whose hand God br@@ ing@@ eth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly .
he lo@@ os@@ eth the bond of kings , and gir@@ de@@ th their lo@@ ins with a gir@@ dle .
only do not two things un@@ to me : then will I not hide myself from the@@ e .
but his f@@ les@@ h upon him shall have p@@ ain , and his sou@@ l within him shall mour@@ n .
Th@@ ine own m@@ outh condem@@ net@@ h the@@ e , and not I : ye@@ a , th@@ ine own li@@ ps testify against the@@ e .
H@@ ast th@@ ou heard the secret of God ? and dost th@@ ou re@@ strain wis@@ dom to th@@ y@@ self ?
I was at ease , but he hat@@ h broken me as@@ under : he hat@@ h also taken me by my nec@@ k , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
O that one might p@@ lead for a man with God , as a man ple@@ ade@@ th for his neighbour !
lay down now , put me in a su@@ re@@ ty with the@@ e ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
he te@@ aret@@ h himself in his an@@ ger : shall the ear@@ th be for@@ sak@@ en for the@@ e ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
if indeed ye will mag@@ ni@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves against me , and p@@ lead against me my re@@ pro@@ ach :
mark me , and be ast@@ on@@ ished , and lay your hand upon your m@@ outh .
I would declare un@@ to him the number of my steps ; as a pr@@ ince would I go near un@@ to him .
Ye@@ a , I attended un@@ to you , and , be@@ hold , there was none of you that convinced Jo@@ b , or that answ@@ ered his words :
she is har@@ dened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in v@@ ain without fear ;
Wil@@ t th@@ ou also dis@@ annul my judgment ? w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou condemn me , that th@@ ou may@@ est be righ@@ te@@ ous ?
he be@@ hol@@ de@@ th all high things : he is a king over all the children of pride .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I ab@@ h@@ or myself , and rep@@ ent in d@@ ust and ashes .
for he hat@@ h not desp@@ ised nor ab@@ hor@@ red the aff@@ li@@ ction of the aff@@ lic@@ ted ; neither hat@@ h he hi@@ d his face from him ; but when he cri@@ ed un@@ to him , he heard .
the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him ; and he will she@@ w them his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
O love the Lord , all ye his sa@@ ints : for the Lord preser@@ vet@@ h the fa@@ ith@@ ful , and plen@@ ti@@ fully re@@ war@@ de@@ th the proud do@@ er .
be@@ hold , the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mer@@ cy ;
Ye@@ a , they opened their m@@ outh wide against me , and said , A@@ ha , a@@ ha , our eye hat@@ h seen it .
for he f@@ lat@@ ter@@ eth himself in his own eyes , until his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity be found to be ha@@ te@@ ful .
for they got not the land in possession by their own s@@ word , neither did their own arm save them : but TH@@ Y right hand , and th@@ ine arm , and the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , because th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st a favour un@@ to them .
but it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord God , that I may declare all TH@@ Y works .
and I said , This is my in@@ fir@@ mity : but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High .
TH@@ Y way is in the sea , and TH@@ Y path in the great waters , and TH@@ Y foot@@ steps are not known .
they remember@@ ed not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy .
she sent out her b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s un@@ to the sea , and her branches un@@ to the river .
make their no@@ bles like O@@ re@@ b , and like Ze@@ e@@ b : ye@@ a , all their pr@@ inces as Z@@ eb@@ ah , and as Zal@@ mun@@ na :
su@@ rely his sal@@ vation is n@@ igh them that fear him ; that gl@@ ory may d@@ well in our land .
only with th@@ ine eyes s@@ halt th@@ ou be@@ hold and see the reward of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
for as the heav@@ en is high above the ear@@ th , so great is his mer@@ cy toward them that fear him .
but the mer@@ cy of the Lord is from ever@@ lasting to ever@@ lasting upon them that fear him , and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to children 's children ;
who lay@@ eth the be@@ ams of his ch@@ ambers in the waters : who mak@@ eth the cl@@ ou@@ ds his char@@ i@@ ot : who walk@@ eth upon the w@@ ings of the wind :
he hat@@ h given meat un@@ to them that fear him : he will ever be min@@ d@@ ful of his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
the w@@ ic@@ ked shall see it , and be gri@@ ev@@ ed ; he shall gn@@ ash with his te@@ eth , and mel@@ t away : the desire of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall per@@ ish .
he will b@@ less them that fear the Lord , both small and great .
and take not the word of truth ut@@ ter@@ ly out of my m@@ outh ; for I have hoped in TH@@ Y judg@@ ments .
for the Lord hat@@ h chosen Jac@@ o@@ b un@@ to himself , and Israel for his pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure .
to him which divided the Red sea into parts : for his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever :
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
which made heav@@ en , and ear@@ th , the sea , and all that there@@ in is : which keep@@ eth truth for ever :
and they lay wait for their own blood ; they l@@ ur@@ k priv@@ ily for their own lives .
be not wise in th@@ ine own eyes : fear the Lord , and de@@ part from ev@@ il .
but he that sin@@ net@@ h against me wron@@ get@@ h his own sou@@ l : all they that h@@ ate me love death .
the mer@@ ci@@ ful man do@@ eth good to his own sou@@ l : but he that is cru@@ el troub@@ le@@ th his own f@@ les@@ h .
the w@@ ic@@ ked is s@@ nar@@ ed by the trans@@ gres@@ sion of his li@@ ps : but the just shall come out of trouble .
there is that mak@@ eth himself rich , yet hat@@ h nothing : there is that mak@@ eth himself poor , yet hat@@ h great ri@@ ches .
wis@@ dom res@@ te@@ th in the heart of him that hat@@ h understanding : but that which is in the mid@@ st of fo@@ ols is made known .
he that beg@@ et@@ te@@ th a fo@@ ol do@@ eth it to his sor@@ row : and the father of a fo@@ ol hat@@ h no joy .
through desire a man , having separated himself , seek@@ eth and inter@@ med@@ d@@ le@@ th with all wis@@ dom .
a man 's gift mak@@ eth room for him , and br@@ ing@@ eth him before great men .
even a child is known by his do@@ ings , whether his work be p@@ ure , and whether it be right .
the man that w@@ ander@@ eth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the dead .
L@@ est th@@ ou learn his ways , and get a sn@@ are to TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as he that li@@ eth down in the mid@@ st of the sea , or as he that li@@ eth upon the top of a m@@ ast .
answer a fo@@ ol according to his Fol@@ ly , lest he be wise in his own conce@@ it .
Se@@ est th@@ ou a man wise in his own conce@@ it ? there is more hope of a fo@@ ol than of him .
let another man praise the@@ e , and not th@@ ine own m@@ outh ; a st@@ ran@@ ger , and not th@@ ine own li@@ ps .
the rich man is wise in his own conce@@ it ; but the poor that hat@@ h understanding sear@@ ch@@ eth him out .
every word of God is p@@ ure : he is a shield un@@ to them that put their trust in him .
give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wis@@ dom concerning all things that are done under heav@@ en : this sor@@ e trav@@ ail hat@@ h God given to the sons of man to be exerc@@ ised there@@ with .
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wis@@ dom than all they that have been before me in Jer@@ usalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wis@@ dom and knowledge .
I said in mine heart , G@@ o to now , I will prove the@@ e with mir@@ th , therefore enjoy pleas@@ ure : and , be@@ hold , this also is van@@ ity .
that which hat@@ h been is named already , and it is known that it is man : neither may he conten@@ d with him that is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than he .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , but in the day of ad@@ versity consider : God also hat@@ h set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
a fo@@ ol also is full of words : a man can@@ not tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
I would lead the@@ e , and bring the@@ e into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me : I would cause the@@ e to drink of sp@@ ic@@ ed wine of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lo@@ f@@ ty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
then shall the lam@@ bs fe@@ ed after their manner , and the waste places of the f@@ at ones shall st@@ ran@@ gers eat .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that are wise in their own eyes , and pru@@ dent in their own sight !
therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; be@@ hold , a vir@@ gin shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Im@@ man@@ uel .
and I will wait upon the Lord , that hi@@ de@@ th his face from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and I will look for him .
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your gl@@ ory ?
shall the ax@@ e bo@@ ast itself against him that he@@ w@@ eth there@@ with ? or shall the saw mag@@ ni@@ fy itself against him that shak@@ eth it ? as if the ro@@ d should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his wr@@ ath : but his lies shall not be so .
in that day shall Egypt be like un@@ to women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shak@@ eth over it .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and perform it .
stay yo@@ ur@@ selves , and wonder ; cry ye out , and cry : they are dr@@ un@@ ken , but not with wine ; they stag@@ ger , but not with strong drink .
they were all as@@ ha@@ med of a people that could not profit them , nor be an help nor profit , but a sh@@ ame , and also a re@@ pro@@ ach .
be@@ hold , the name of the Lord co@@ me@@ th from far , burning with his an@@ ger , and the burden there@@ of is heavy : his li@@ ps are full of in@@ dign@@ ation , and his ton@@ gue as a dev@@ our@@ ing fire :
for I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
who gave Jac@@ o@@ b for a sp@@ oil , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did not the Lord , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his law .
this people have I formed for myself ; they shall she@@ w forth my praise .
he he@@ w@@ eth him down c@@ ed@@ ars , and tak@@ eth the Cy@@ press and the o@@ ak , which he strength@@ en@@ eth for himself among the trees of the forest : he plan@@ te@@ th an ash , and the rain do@@ th no@@ ur@@ ish it .
and the resi@@ due there@@ of he mak@@ eth a go@@ d , even his Gra@@ ven image : he fal@@ le@@ th down un@@ to it , and wor@@ ship@@ pet@@ h it , and pray@@ eth un@@ to it , and sa@@ ith , D@@ eli@@ ver me ; for th@@ ou art my go@@ d .
they bear him upon the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he stan@@ de@@ th ; from his place shall he not remove : ye@@ a , one shall cry un@@ to him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be pollu@@ ted ? and I will not give my gl@@ ory un@@ to another .
and he hat@@ h made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand hat@@ h he hi@@ d me , and made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver hat@@ h he hi@@ d me ;
art th@@ ou not it which hat@@ h dri@@ ed the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hat@@ h made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the ran@@ so@@ med to pass over ?
cry al@@ oud , spar@@ e not , lift up TH@@ Y voice like a tr@@ ump@@ et , and she@@ w my people their trans@@ gres@@ sion , and the house of Jac@@ o@@ b their sin@@ s .
the way of peace they know not ; and there is no judgment in their go@@ ings : they have made them cro@@ oked p@@ aths : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever go@@ eth there@@ in shall not know peace .
be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h proclaimed un@@ to the end of the world , S@@ ay ye to the daughter of Z@@ ion , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y sal@@ vation co@@ me@@ th ; be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
they shall not labour in v@@ ain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the se@@ ed of the b@@ les@@ sed of the Lord , and their off@@ spring with them .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , What in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity have your fa@@ thers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after van@@ ity , and are become v@@ ain ?
for my people have committed two ev@@ ils ; they have for@@ sak@@ en me the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters , and he@@ wed them out c@@ ister@@ ns , broken c@@ ister@@ ns , that can hold no water .
turn , O back@@ sli@@ ding children , sa@@ ith the Lord ; for I am married un@@ to you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Z@@ ion :
the lion is come up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and the destro@@ yer of the Gen@@ ti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make TH@@ Y land de@@ so@@ late ; and TH@@ Y cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabi@@ tant .
make ye mention to the nations ; be@@ hold , publish against Jer@@ usalem , that wat@@ chers come from a far country , and give out their voice against the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the he@@ a@@ then , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known : and I will send a s@@ word after them , ti@@ ll I have consu@@ med them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not take the@@ e a wife , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou have sons or da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in this place .
and th@@ ou , even th@@ y@@ self , s@@ halt dis@@ continue from th@@ ine heritage that I gave the@@ e ; and I will cause the@@ e to serve th@@ ine enem@@ ies in the land which th@@ ou know@@ est not : for ye have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in mine an@@ ger , which shall bur@@ n for ever .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ te@@ th on eg@@ gs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ te@@ th ri@@ ches , and not by right , shall leave them in the mid@@ st of his days , and at his end shall be a fo@@ ol .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when th@@ ou s@@ halt bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them : for they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
that sa@@ ith , I will build me a wide house and large ch@@ ambers , and cut@@ te@@ th him out windows ; and it is ci@@ eled with c@@ ed@@ ar , and pain@@ ted with ver@@ mil@@ ion .
I sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e in TH@@ Y prosperity ; but th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I will not hear . this hat@@ h been TH@@ Y manner from TH@@ Y youth , that th@@ ou obe@@ yed@@ st not my voice .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken i@@ dol ? is he a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure ? where@@ fore are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , ti@@ ll they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave un@@ to them and to their fa@@ thers .
yet ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord ; that ye might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with the works of your hands to your own hurt .
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
and command them to say un@@ to their mas@@ ters , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say un@@ to your mas@@ ters ;
now therefore why h@@ ast th@@ ou not re@@ proved Jerem@@ i@@ ah of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , which mak@@ eth himself a pro@@ phe@@ t to you ?
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and will bur@@ st TH@@ Y bonds , and st@@ ran@@ gers shall no more serve themselves of him :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have mer@@ cy on his d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places ; and the city shall be buil@@ ded upon her own he@@ ap , and the palace shall remain after the manner there@@ of .
for the Lord hat@@ h re@@ deemed Jac@@ o@@ b , and ran@@ so@@ med him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
set the@@ e up w@@ ay@@ marks , make the@@ e high he@@ aps : set th@@ ine heart toward the highway , even the way which th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test : turn again , O vir@@ gin of Israel , turn again to these TH@@ Y cities .
and I bought the field of Han@@ ame@@ el my un@@ cle 's son , that was in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , and weighed him the money , even se@@ ven@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els of silver .
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
when the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army fought against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish , and against Az@@ ek@@ ah : for these def@@ enced cities remained of the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but ye turned and pollu@@ ted my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom ye had set at liber@@ ty at their pleas@@ ure , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection , to be un@@ to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did he@@ arken un@@ to the words of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore my fur@@ y and mine an@@ ger was p@@ oured forth , and was kin@@ d@@ led in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ; and they are was@@ ted and de@@ so@@ late , as at this day .
we have heard the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b , ( he is exceeding proud ) his lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess , and his ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy , and his pride , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of his heart .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is sp@@ o@@ iled , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
and sp@@ ake kin@@ dly un@@ to him , and set his th@@ r@@ one above the th@@ r@@ one of the kings that were with him in Bab@@ yl@@ on ,
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts : all her gates are de@@ so@@ late : her pri@@ ests si@@ gh , her vir@@ g@@ ins are aff@@ lic@@ ted , and she is in bit@@ ter@@ ness .
and from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her beauty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , and they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have so@@ dden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rus@@ hing , saying , b@@ les@@ sed be the gl@@ ory of the Lord from his place .
make a chain : for the land is full of blo@@ ody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , G@@ o ye after him through the city , and sm@@ ite : let not your eye spar@@ e , neither have ye p@@ ity :
that th@@ ou h@@ ast also built un@@ to the@@ e an emin@@ ent place , and h@@ ast made the@@ e an high place in every street .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of TH@@ Y sister So@@ dom , pride , ful@@ ness of bread , and ab@@ und@@ ance of id@@ len@@ ess was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
H@@ ath given forth upon us@@ ury , and hat@@ h taken increase : shall he then live ? he shall not live : he hat@@ h done all these ab@@ omin@@ ations ; he shall su@@ rely die ; his blood shall be upon him .
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand un@@ to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known un@@ to them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ p@@ ied for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands :
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known un@@ to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
moreover also I gave them my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
in the@@ e are men that carry tal@@ es to shed blood : and in the@@ e they eat upon the mountains : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e they commit le@@ w@@ d@@ ness .
then I saw that she was def@@ iled , that they took both one way ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city ! I will even make the p@@ ile for fire great .
and your ti@@ res shall be upon your heads , and your sho@@ es upon your feet : ye shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but ye shall p@@ ine away for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mour@@ n one toward another .
and they shall make a sp@@ oil of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and they shall break down TH@@ Y walls , and destroy TH@@ Y pleas@@ ant houses : and they shall lay TH@@ Y stones and TH@@ Y tim@@ ber and TH@@ Y d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the water .
with TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and with th@@ ine understanding th@@ ou h@@ ast gotten the@@ e ri@@ ches , and h@@ ast gotten gold and silver into TH@@ Y treasures :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast set th@@ ine heart as the heart of God ;
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely because my flock became a pre@@ y , and my flock became meat to every be@@ ast of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my flock , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and f@@ ed not my flock ;
and they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , where@@ in your fa@@ thers have d@@ wel@@ t ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my ser@@ vant David shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall bur@@ n the weapons with fire : and they shall sp@@ oil those that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and ro@@ b those that ro@@ bbed them , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions have I done un@@ to them , and hi@@ d my face from them .
and in the day that he go@@ eth into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , un@@ to the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and upon that day shall the pr@@ ince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; If the pr@@ ince give a gift un@@ to any of his sons , the inher@@ it@@ ance there@@ of shall be his sons ' ; it shall be their possession by inher@@ it@@ ance .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace , and he will deliver us out of th@@ ine hand , O king .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . now the king sp@@ ake and said un@@ to Daniel , Th@@ y God whom th@@ ou serv@@ est continu@@ ally , he will deliver the@@ e .
Ye@@ a , he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself even to the pr@@ ince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
neither shall he regard the God of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d : for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
so he went and took Go@@ mer the daughter of Di@@ bla@@ im ; which conce@@ ived , and b@@ are him a son .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can@@ not be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people , there it shall be said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the sons of the living God .
and I will give her her v@@ ine@@ yards from th@@ ence , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
and I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me for ever ; ye@@ a , I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and in judgment , and in lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , and in mer@@ cies .
and the pride of Israel do@@ th testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fall in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; Ju@@ da@@ h also shall fall with them .
and the pride of Israel testi@@ fi@@ eth to his face : and they do not return to the Lord their God , nor seek him for all this .
though I have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they imag@@ ine mis@@ chief against me .
I ta@@ ught E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im also to go , taking them by their arms ; but they knew not that I he@@ aled them .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; and I fear the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , which hat@@ h made the sea and the d@@ ry land .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the shadow , ti@@ ll he might see what would become of the city .
hear , all ye people ; he@@ arken , O ear@@ th , and all that there@@ in is : and let the Lord God be witness against you , the Lord from his hol@@ y temp@@ le .
and I will p@@ lu@@ ck up TH@@ Y gro@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e : so will I destroy TH@@ Y cities .
he re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h the sea , and mak@@ eth it d@@ ry , and dri@@ eth up all the rivers : B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ het@@ h , and Car@@ mel , and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ het@@ h .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and off@@ end , imp@@ ut@@ ing this his power un@@ to his go@@ d .
therefore they sacrifice un@@ to their net , and bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to their dra@@ g ; because by them their portion is f@@ at , and their meat plen@@ te@@ ous .
for I , sa@@ ith the Lord , will be un@@ to her a wall of fire round about , and will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
thus speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , saying , exec@@ ute true judgment , and she@@ w mer@@ cy and comp@@ as@@ sions every man to his brother :
and op@@ press not the wi@@ dow , nor the fa@@ ther@@ less , the st@@ ran@@ ger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imag@@ ine ev@@ il against his brother in your heart .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Spe@@ ak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and let none of you imag@@ ine ev@@ il in your hear@@ ts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that I h@@ ate , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and T@@ y@@ ru@@ s did build her@@ self a strong hold , and he@@ ap@@ ed up silver as the d@@ ust , and fine gold as the m@@ ire of the streets .
in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem ; and he that is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the an@@ gel of the Lord before them .
my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him for the fear where@@ with he fear@@ ed me , and was afraid before my name .
and now we call the proud happy ; ye@@ a , they that work w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess are set up ; ye@@ a , they that temp@@ t God are even delivered .
when Her@@ od the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jer@@ usalem with him .
and think not to say within yo@@ ur@@ selves , We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham to our father : for I say un@@ to you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
lay not up for yo@@ ur@@ selves treasures upon ear@@ th , where mo@@ th and rust do@@ th corrupt , and where th@@ i@@ ev@@ es break through and ste@@ al :
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but consider@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
T@@ ho@@ u hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite , first cast out the be@@ am out of th@@ ine own eye ; and then s@@ halt th@@ ou see clearly to cast out the mote out of TH@@ Y brother 's eye .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
if ye then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts un@@ to your children , how much more shall your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en give good things to them that ask him ?
and , be@@ hold , they brought to him a man si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , lying on a bed : and J@@ es@@ us seeing their faith said un@@ to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy ; Son , be of good che@@ er ; TH@@ Y sin@@ s be for@@ given the@@ e .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
and , be@@ hold , there was a man which had his hand with@@ ered . and they asked him , saying , Is it law@@ ful to he@@ al on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days ? that they might accuse him .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay J@@ es@@ us con@@ strained his dis@@ cip@@ les to get into a ship , and to go before him un@@ to the other side , while he sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away .
and his dis@@ cip@@ les say un@@ to him , Wh@@ ence should we have so much bread in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , as to fill so great a multi@@ tude ?
then charged he his dis@@ cip@@ les that they should tell no man that he was J@@ es@@ us the Ch@@ r@@ ist .
then said J@@ es@@ us un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what is a man pro@@ fi@@ ted , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own sou@@ l ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his sou@@ l ?
then the dis@@ cip@@ les understood that he sp@@ ake un@@ to them of John the B@@ ap@@ tist .
but wh@@ os@@ o shall off@@ end one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and that he were dro@@ w@@ ned in the dep@@ th of the sea .
and when he had begun to rec@@ k@@ on , one was brought un@@ to him , which owed him ten thousand tal@@ ents .
but the same ser@@ vant went out , and found one of his fel@@ low@@ servants , which owed him an hundred p@@ ence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the thro@@ at , saying , P@@ ay me that th@@ ou ow@@ est .
for there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were so born from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b : and there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which have made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
then came to him the mother of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e 's children with her sons , wor@@ shipping him , and desi@@ ring a certain thing of him .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , that they might receive the fru@@ its of it .
they say un@@ to him , He will mis@@ er@@ ably destroy those w@@ ic@@ ked men , and will let out his v@@ ine@@ yard un@@ to other hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , which shall ren@@ der him the fru@@ its in their se@@ as@@ ons .
and when the chief pri@@ ests and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had heard his par@@ ables , they perceived that he sp@@ ake of them .
and gre@@ et@@ ings in the markets , and to be called of men , R@@ ab@@ bi , R@@ ab@@ bi .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall ex@@ alt himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that shall hum@@ ble himself shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
and he shall send his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heav@@ en to the other .
but the wise answ@@ ered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
the Son of man go@@ eth as it is written of him : but wo@@ e un@@ to that man by whom the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
now the chief pri@@ ests , and el@@ ders , and all the council , sought false witness against J@@ es@@ us , to put him to death ;
and when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean lin@@ en clo@@ th ,
and go quickly , and tell his dis@@ cip@@ les that he is risen from the dead ; and , be@@ hold , he go@@ eth before you into Gal@@ il@@ ee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
and J@@ es@@ us came and sp@@ ake un@@ to them , saying , All power is given un@@ to me in heav@@ en and in ear@@ th .
and he he@@ aled many that were si@@ ck of di@@ vers diseases , and cast out many dev@@ ils ; and suffered not the dev@@ ils to speak , because they knew him .
and if S@@ atan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can@@ not stand , but hat@@ h an end .
and should sle@@ ep , and rise night and day , and the se@@ ed should spring and grow up , he know@@ eth not how .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tom@@ bs , cr@@ ying , and cutting himself with stones .
and he depar@@ ted , and began to publish in Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is how great things J@@ es@@ us had done for him : and all men did mar@@ v@@ el .
and when J@@ es@@ us was passed over again by ship un@@ to the other side , much people gathered un@@ to him : and he was n@@ igh un@@ to the sea .
and J@@ es@@ us , immediately kno@@ wing in himself that vir@@ tu@@ e had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Wh@@ o touched my clo@@ th@@ es ?
and he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
and they la@@ ug@@ hed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay he con@@ strained his dis@@ cip@@ les to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before un@@ to B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida , while he sent away the people .
and when he had called the people un@@ to him with his dis@@ cip@@ les also , he said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own sou@@ l ?
for he ta@@ ught his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said un@@ to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall off@@ end one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and he were cast into the sea .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
for David himself said by the Holy gh@@ ost , The Lord said to my Lord , sit th@@ ou on my right hand , ti@@ ll I make th@@ ine enem@@ ies TH@@ Y foot@@ st@@ ool .
David therefore himself cal@@ le@@ th him Lord ; and wh@@ ence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gla@@ dly .
and they began to be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and to say un@@ to him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
the Son of man indeed go@@ eth , as it is written of him : but wo@@ e to that man by whom the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and the chief pri@@ ests and all the council sought for witness against J@@ es@@ us to put him to death ; and found none .
and the second time the Co@@ ck crew . and Peter called to mind the word that J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to him , Be@@ fore the Co@@ ck cro@@ w twice , th@@ ou s@@ halt deny me th@@ ri@@ ce . and when he thought there@@ on , he we@@ pt .
and the multi@@ tude cr@@ ying al@@ oud began to desire him to do as he had ever done un@@ to them .
but go your way , tell his dis@@ cip@@ les and Peter that he go@@ eth before you into Gal@@ il@@ ee : there shall ye see him , as he said un@@ to you .
after@@ ward he appeared un@@ to the eleven as they sat at meat , and up@@ bra@@ i@@ ded them with their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and when he came out , he could not speak un@@ to them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le : for he bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to them , and remained spe@@ ech@@ less .
he shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the High@@ est : and the Lord God shall give un@@ to him the th@@ r@@ one of his father David :
and his mer@@ cy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and begin not to say within yo@@ ur@@ selves , We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham to our father : for I say un@@ to you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and he brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on a pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said un@@ to him , If th@@ ou be the Son of God , cast th@@ y@@ self down from hence :
for he was ast@@ on@@ ished , and all that were with him , at the dra@@ ught of the fis@@ hes which they had taken :
and he withdrew himself into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and pray@@ ed .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but perce@@ iv@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore neither thought I myself wor@@ thy to come un@@ to the@@ e : but say in a word , and my ser@@ vant shall be he@@ aled .
Simon answ@@ ered and said , I sup@@ pose that he , to whom he for@@ gave most . and he said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast righ@@ tly jud@@ ged .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I say un@@ to the@@ e , Her sin@@ s , which are many , are for@@ given ; for she lov@@ ed much : but to whom little is for@@ given , the same lov@@ eth little .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the ma@@ iden .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , and he@@ aled them that had need of he@@ aling .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for what is a man advant@@ aged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
and sent mes@@ sen@@ gers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samar@@ it@@ ans , to make ready for him .
and he@@ al the si@@ ck that are there@@ in , and say un@@ to them , The k@@ ing@@ dom of God is come n@@ igh un@@ to you .
if ye then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts un@@ to your children : how much more shall your heav@@ en@@ ly F@@ ather give the Holy Spiri@@ t to them that ask him ?
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spir@@ its more w@@ ic@@ ked than himself ; and they enter in , and d@@ well there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
but he that den@@ i@@ eth me before men shall be denied before the an@@ gel@@ s of God .
and when they bring you un@@ to the syn@@ ago@@ gues , and un@@ to mag@@ istrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bes@@ to@@ w my fru@@ its ?
and I will say to my sou@@ l , Sou@@ l , th@@ ou h@@ ast much goods laid up for many years ; take th@@ ine ease , eat , drink , and be mer@@ ry .
and when he had said these things , all his ad@@ vers@@ aries were as@@ ha@@ med : and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the g@@ lor@@ ious things that were done by him .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever ex@@ al@@ te@@ th himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ ble@@ th himself shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
and he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
then the ste@@ ward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lor@@ d tak@@ eth away from me the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship : I can@@ not di@@ g ; to be@@ g I am as@@ ha@@ med .
and he said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are they which justify yo@@ ur@@ selves before men ; but God know@@ eth your hear@@ ts : for that which is highly es@@ te@@ emed among men is ab@@ omin@@ ation in the sight of God .
it were better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and he cast into the sea , than that he should off@@ end one of these little ones .
and shall not God av@@ en@@ ge his own elect , which cry day and night un@@ to him , though he bear long with them ?
the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee stood and pray@@ ed thus with himself , God , I than@@ k the@@ e , that I am not as other men are , ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , un@@ just , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , or even as this pub@@ lican .
and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they fear@@ ed the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this par@@ able against them .
there were therefore seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
settle it therefore in your hear@@ ts , not to medi@@ t@@ ate before what ye shall answer :
and they were glad , and c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted to give him money .
and he said un@@ to them , The kings of the Gen@@ ti@@ les exercise l@@ ord@@ ship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benef@@ actors .
and many other things b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ously sp@@ ake they against him .
and they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow per@@ ver@@ ting the nation , and for@@ bidding to give tri@@ bute to Ca@@ es@@ ar , saying that he himself is Ch@@ r@@ ist a King .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged un@@ to Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who himself also was at Jer@@ usalem at that time .
and one of the mal@@ ef@@ actors which were han@@ ged ra@@ iled on him , saying , If th@@ ou be Ch@@ r@@ ist , save th@@ y@@ self and us .
and they said one to another , did not our heart bur@@ n within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the s@@ crip@@ tures ?
and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
and they gave him a piece of a bro@@ iled fish , and of an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
he was not that L@@ ight , but was sent to bear witness of that L@@ ight .
he came un@@ to his own , and his own received him not .
the next day John se@@ eth J@@ es@@ us coming un@@ to him , and sa@@ ith , be@@ hold the lam@@ b of God , which tak@@ eth away the sin of the world .
this is he of whom I said , After me co@@ me@@ th a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
he first fin@@ de@@ th his own brother Simon , and sa@@ ith un@@ to him , We have found the Mes@@ si@@ as , which is , being interpreted , the Ch@@ r@@ ist .
J@@ es@@ us saw N@@ athan@@ a@@ el coming to him , and sa@@ ith of him , be@@ hold an Isra@@ elite indeed , in whom is no gu@@ ile !
but he sp@@ ake of the temp@@ le of his body .
and needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
John answ@@ ered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heav@@ en .
art th@@ ou greater than our father Jac@@ o@@ b , which gave us the well , and d@@ rank there@@ of himself , and his children , and his c@@ attle ?
but the hour co@@ me@@ th , and now is , when the true wor@@ ship@@ pers shall worship the F@@ ather in spirit and in truth : for the F@@ ather seek@@ eth such to worship him .
for J@@ es@@ us himself testified , that a pro@@ phe@@ t hat@@ h no honour in his own country .
so the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to him , Th@@ y son li@@ vet@@ h : and himself believed , and his whole house .
the man depar@@ ted , and told the Jews that it was J@@ es@@ us , which had made him whole .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the F@@ ather which hat@@ h sent me .
if I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
when J@@ es@@ us then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come un@@ to him , he sa@@ ith un@@ to Philip , Wh@@ ence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
it is written in the pro@@ ph@@ ets , An@@ d they shall be all ta@@ ught of God . every man therefore that hat@@ h heard , and hat@@ h learned of the F@@ ather , co@@ me@@ th un@@ to me .
for there is no man that do@@ eth any thing in secret , and he himself seek@@ eth to be known openly . if th@@ ou do these things , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self to the world .
but when his bre@@ th@@ ren were gone up , then went he also up un@@ to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
he that speak@@ eth of himself seek@@ eth his own gl@@ ory : but he that seek@@ eth his gl@@ ory that sent him , the same is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
( but this sp@@ ake he of the Spiri@@ t , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy gh@@ ost was not yet given ; because that J@@ es@@ us was not yet gl@@ ori@@ fied . )
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Th@@ ough I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know wh@@ ence I came , and w@@ hi@@ ther I go ; but ye can@@ not tell wh@@ ence I come , and w@@ hi@@ ther I go .
I am one that bear witness of myself , and the F@@ ather that sent me be@@ aret@@ h witness of me .
then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he sa@@ ith , W@@ hi@@ ther I go , ye can@@ not come .
they understood not that he sp@@ ake to them of the F@@ ather .
art th@@ ou greater than our father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which is dead ? and the pro@@ ph@@ ets are dead : whom mak@@ est th@@ ou th@@ y@@ self ?
and his dis@@ cip@@ les asked him , saying , Mas@@ ter , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born b@@ lin@@ d ?
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , Ne@@ ither hat@@ h this man sin@@ ned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manif@@ est in him .
but by what means he now se@@ eth , we know not ; or who hat@@ h opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
now we know that God he@@ aret@@ h not sin@@ ners : but if any man be a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and do@@ eth his will , him he he@@ aret@@ h .
he answ@@ ered and said , Wh@@ o is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
if he called them go@@ ds , un@@ to whom the word of God came , and the s@@ crip@@ ture can@@ not be broken ;
there they made him a Sup@@ per ; and Mar@@ th@@ a served : but Lazar@@ us was one of them that sat at the table with him .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the F@@ ather which sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the pass@@ over , when J@@ es@@ us knew that his hour was come that he should de@@ part out of this world un@@ to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own which were in the world , he lov@@ ed them un@@ to the end .
J@@ es@@ us kno@@ wing that the F@@ ather had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
for he knew who should bet@@ ray him ; therefore said he , Y@@ e are not all clean .
by this shall all men know that ye are my dis@@ cip@@ les , if ye have love one to another .
he that hat@@ h my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keep@@ eth them , he it is that lov@@ eth me : and he that lov@@ eth me shall be lov@@ ed of my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will manif@@ est myself to him .
Ju@@ das sa@@ ith un@@ to him , not Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , Lord , how is it that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t manif@@ est th@@ y@@ self un@@ to us , and not un@@ to the world ?
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world ha@@ te@@ th you .
and ye now therefore have sor@@ row : but I will see you again , and your heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and your joy no man tak@@ eth from you .
for the F@@ ather himself lov@@ eth you , because ye have lov@@ ed me , and have believed that I came out from God .
and for their sak@@ es I sanc@@ ti@@ fy myself , that they also might be sanc@@ ti@@ fied through the truth .
that the saying might be fulfilled , which he sp@@ ake , O@@ f them which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me have I lost none .
then led they J@@ es@@ us from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has un@@ to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be def@@ iled ; but that they might eat the pass@@ over .
the Jews answ@@ ered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
and how hear we every man in our own ton@@ gue , where@@ in we were born ?
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
for David is not as@@ cen@@ ded into the heav@@ ens : but he sa@@ ith himself , The Lord said un@@ to my Lord , sit th@@ ou on my right hand ,
now when they heard this , they were pri@@ cked in their heart , and said un@@ to Peter and to the rest of the A@@ post@@ les , Men and bre@@ th@@ ren , what shall we do ?
and with many other words did he testify and ex@@ h@@ ort , saying , S@@ ave yo@@ ur@@ selves from this un@@ toward generation .
and they continued ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in the A@@ post@@ les ' doc@@ tr@@ ine and fel@@ low@@ ship , and in breaking of bread , and in pray@@ ers .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , th@@ ou art God , which h@@ ast made heav@@ en , and ear@@ th , and the sea , and all that in them is :
but we will give ourselves continu@@ ally to pray@@ er , and to the ministry of the word .
so Jac@@ o@@ b went down into Egypt , and died , he , and our fa@@ thers ,
then Simon himself believed also : and when he was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , he continued with Philip , and won@@ dered , be@@ holding the mir@@ ac@@ les and signs which were done .
and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch answ@@ ered Philip , and said , I pra@@ y the@@ e , of whom speak@@ eth the pro@@ phe@@ t this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
but Philip was found at Az@@ o@@ tus : and passing through he pre@@ ached in all the cities , ti@@ ll he came to Ca@@ es@@ area .
and he fell to the ear@@ th , and heard a voice saying un@@ to him , Sa@@ ul , Sa@@ ul , why persec@@ u@@ test th@@ ou me ?
a dev@@ out man , and one that fear@@ ed God with all his house , which gave much al@@ ms to the people , and pray@@ ed to God al@@ way .
and when he had declared all these things un@@ to them , he sent them to J@@ op@@ pa .
not to all the people , but un@@ to witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
as they minist@@ ered to the Lord , and fas@@ ted , the Holy gh@@ ost said , separate me Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Sa@@ ul for the work where@@ un@@ to I have called them .
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Gal@@ il@@ ee to Jer@@ usalem , who are his witnesses un@@ to the people .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heav@@ en , and fruit@@ ful se@@ as@@ ons , filling our hear@@ ts with food and gla@@ d@@ ness .
and with these say@@ ings scar@@ ce re@@ strained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice un@@ to them .
and when they were come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received of the church , and of the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
then all the multi@@ tude kept sil@@ ence , and gave audience to Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Paul , declaring what mir@@ ac@@ les and won@@ ders God had w@@ rought among the Gen@@ ti@@ les by them .
Simeon hat@@ h declared how God at the first did visit the Gen@@ ti@@ les , to take out of them a people for his name .
and Ju@@ das and Sil@@ as , being pro@@ ph@@ ets also themselves , ex@@ hor@@ ted the bre@@ th@@ ren with many words , and confirmed them .
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and was@@ hed their stri@@ pes ; and was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , he and all his , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay .
that they should seek the Lord , if hap@@ ly they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
and when Sil@@ as and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the Jews that J@@ es@@ us was Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and he came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and left them there : but he himself entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and reas@@ oned with the Jews .
then said Paul , John veril@@ y b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism of rep@@ ent@@ ance , saying un@@ to the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that minist@@ ered un@@ to him , Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us and Er@@ as@@ tus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
but when they knew that he was a J@@ ew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cri@@ ed out , Great is Diana of the E@@ ph@@ es@@ ians .
and after the u@@ pro@@ ar was ce@@ ased , Paul called un@@ to him the dis@@ cip@@ les , and embrac@@ ed them , and depar@@ ted for to go into Macedonia .
and there abo@@ de three months . and when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sa@@ il into Syria , he pur@@ posed to return through Macedonia .
and we went before to ship , and sa@@ iled un@@ to As@@ sos , there inten@@ ding to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , min@@ ding himself to go af@@ oo@@ t .
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ce@@ ased not to warn every one night and day with te@@ ars .
and as they bound him with th@@ on@@ gs , Paul said un@@ to the centur@@ ion that stood by , Is it law@@ ful for you to s@@ cour@@ ge a man that is a Roman , and un@@ condemned ?
then stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay they depar@@ ted from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and res@@ cu@@ ed him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause where@@ fore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
then the soldiers , as it was comman@@ ded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Anti@@ patri@@ s .
and he comman@@ ded a centur@@ ion to keep Paul , and to let him have liber@@ ty , and that he should for@@ bid none of his acqu@@ ain@@ tance to minister or come un@@ to him .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : where@@ fore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er , and commun@@ ed with him .
but rise , and stand upon TH@@ Y feet : for I have appeared un@@ to the@@ e for this purpose , to make the@@ e a minister and a witness both of these things which th@@ ou h@@ ast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear un@@ to the@@ e ;
therefore th@@ ou art in@@ ex@@ cus@@ able , O man , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever th@@ ou art that jud@@ gest : for where@@ in th@@ ou jud@@ gest another , th@@ ou condem@@ n@@ est th@@ y@@ self ; for th@@ ou that jud@@ gest do@@ est the same things .
but after TH@@ Y hard@@ ness and im@@ pen@@ it@@ ent heart treas@@ u@@ rest up un@@ to th@@ y@@ self wr@@ ath against the day of wr@@ ath and reve@@ lation of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God ;
be@@ hold , th@@ ou art called a J@@ ew , and res@@ test in the law , and mak@@ est TH@@ Y bo@@ ast of God ,
T@@ ho@@ u therefore which teach@@ est another , teach@@ est th@@ ou not th@@ y@@ self ? th@@ ou that pre@@ ach@@ est a man should not ste@@ al , dost th@@ ou ste@@ al ?
and not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , by whom we have now received the At@@ on@@ ement .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to sin : but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to God .
the Spiri@@ t itself be@@ aret@@ h witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
likewise the Spiri@@ t also hel@@ pet@@ h our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities : for we know not what we should pra@@ y for as we ought : but the Spiri@@ t itself mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can@@ not be ut@@ tered .
N@@ ay but , O man , who art th@@ ou that rep@@ li@@ est against God ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou made me thus ?
and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
for there is no difference between the J@@ ew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich un@@ to all that call upon him .
I bes@@ e@@ ech you therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , by the mer@@ cies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , hol@@ y , acceptable un@@ to God , which is your reasonable service .
be kin@@ dly aff@@ ec@@ tioned one to another with bro@@ ther@@ ly love ; in honour prefer@@ ring one another ;
Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing in hope ; patient in tri@@ bu@@ lation ; continuing in@@ stan@@ t in pray@@ er ;
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things where@@ with one may edi@@ fy another .
and I myself also am persu@@ aded of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye also are full of Go@@ od@@ ness , filled with all knowledge , able also to ad@@ mon@@ ish one another .
it hat@@ h pleased them veril@@ y ; and their deb@@ tors they are . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , their duty is also to minister un@@ to them in car@@ nal things .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as bec@@ o@@ me@@ th sa@@ ints , and that ye assist her in wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever business she hat@@ h need of you : for she hat@@ h been a succ@@ ou@@ rer of many , and of myself also .
sal@@ ute one another with an hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s . the churches of Ch@@ r@@ ist sal@@ ute you .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence is come abroad un@@ to all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise un@@ to that which is good , and simple concerning ev@@ il .
I than@@ k God that I b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed none of you , but Cris@@ p@@ us and G@@ ai@@ us ;
let no man dec@@ e@@ ive himself . if any man among you se@@ eme@@ th to be wise in this world , let him become a fo@@ ol , that he may be wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged of you , or of man 's judgment : ye@@ a , I judge not mine own self .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temp@@ le of the Holy gh@@ ost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
the wife hat@@ h not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hat@@ h not power of his own body , but the wife .
Def@@ ra@@ ud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er ; and come together again , that S@@ atan temp@@ t you not for your in@@ contin@@ ency .
I say therefore to the un@@ married and wi@@ dows , It is good for them if they abide even as I@@ .
but as God hat@@ h distributed to every man , as the Lord hat@@ h called every one , so let him walk . and so or@@ da@@ in I in all churches .
mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
and un@@ to the Jews I became as a J@@ ew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
and every man that stri@@ vet@@ h for the mas@@ tery is temper@@ ate in all things . now they do it to obtain a cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble cro@@ wn ; but we an incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be jud@@ ged .
he that speak@@ eth in an unknown ton@@ gue edi@@ fi@@ eth himself ; but he that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth edi@@ fi@@ eth the church .
if any man think himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write un@@ to you are the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord .
but if any man be ignor@@ ant , let him be ignor@@ ant .
and when all things shall be sub@@ du@@ ed un@@ to him , then shall the Son also himself be subject un@@ to him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
and why stand we in jeop@@ ard@@ y every hour ?
all the bre@@ th@@ ren gre@@ et you . gre@@ et ye one another with an hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s .
do we begin again to commen@@ d ourselves ? or need we , as some others , ep@@ ist@@ les of commen@@ dation to you , or letters of commen@@ dation from you ?
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
for we pre@@ ach not ourselves , but Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for J@@ es@@ us ' sake .
for we commen@@ d not ourselves again un@@ to you , but give you occasion to gl@@ ory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which gl@@ ory in appearance , and not in heart .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not hen@@ ce@@ forth live un@@ to themselves , but un@@ to him which died for them , and rose again .
and his in@@ ward aff@@ ection is more ab@@ und@@ ant toward you , wh@@ il@@ st he remember@@ eth the obe@@ di@@ ence of you all , how with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ye received him .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and un@@ to us by the will of God .
do ye look on things after the ou@@ tw@@ ard appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , even so are we Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compar@@ e ourselves with some that commen@@ d themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
for such are false A@@ post@@ les , dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful workers , trans@@ forming themselves into the A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and no mar@@ v@@ el ; for S@@ atan himself is transformed into an an@@ gel of light .
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
and I will very gla@@ dly spend and be spent for you ; though the more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly I love you , the less I be lov@@ ed .
gre@@ et one another with an hol@@ y k@@ is@@ s .
and the s@@ crip@@ ture , fore@@ seeing that God would justify the he@@ a@@ then through faith , pre@@ ached before the g@@ os@@ p@@ el un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , In the@@ e shall all nations be b@@ les@@ sed .
they z@@ e@@ al@@ ously affect you , but not well ; ye@@ a , they would exclu@@ de you , that ye might affect them .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h himself .
let him that is ta@@ ught in the word communicate un@@ to him that teach@@ eth in all good things .
for neither they themselves who are circum@@ c@@ ised keep the law ; but desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may gl@@ ory in your f@@ les@@ h .
who being past feeling have given themselves over un@@ to las@@ ci@@ vi@@ ous@@ ness , to work all un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess with gre@@ ed@@ iness .
and be ye kind one to another , ten@@ der@@ hear@@ ted , for@@ giving one another , even as God for Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake hat@@ h for@@ given you .
and walk in love , as Ch@@ r@@ ist also hat@@ h lov@@ ed us , and hat@@ h given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a swe@@ et@@ s@@ mel@@ ling sav@@ our .
submitting yo@@ ur@@ selves one to another in the fear of God .
hus@@ bands , love your wi@@ ves , even as Ch@@ r@@ ist also lov@@ ed the church , and gave himself for it ;
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she rever@@ ence her husband .
stand therefore , having your lo@@ ins gir@@ t about with truth , and having on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
whom I have sent un@@ to you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts .
grace be with all them that love our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist in sinc@@ erity . A@@ men .
let nothing be done through stri@@ fe or va@@ ing@@ l@@ ory ; but in low@@ lin@@ ess of mind let each es@@ te@@ em other better than themselves .
for it is God which wor@@ ket@@ h in you both to will and to do of his good pleas@@ ure .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may re@@ jo@@ ice , and that I may be the less sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful .
who shall change our v@@ ile body , that it may be fas@@ hi@@ oned like un@@ to his g@@ lor@@ ious body , according to the working where@@ by he is able even to sub@@ due all things un@@ to himself .
For@@ bearing one another , and for@@ giving one another , if any man have a quar@@ rel against any : even as Ch@@ r@@ ist for@@ gave you , so also do ye .
continue in pray@@ er , and watch in the same with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving ;
whom I have sent un@@ to you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts ;
as ye know how we ex@@ hor@@ ted and comfor@@ ted and charged every one of you , as a father do@@ th his children ,
now God himself and our F@@ ather , and our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , direct our way un@@ to you .
and the Lord make you to increase and ab@@ ound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
that every one of you should know how to poss@@ ess his ves@@ sel in sanc@@ ti@@ fication and honour ;
but as tou@@ ching bro@@ ther@@ ly love ye need not that I write un@@ to you : for ye yo@@ ur@@ selves are ta@@ ught of God to love one another .
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we comman@@ ded you ;
for the Lord himself shall des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with the tr@@ um@@ p of God : and the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist shall rise first :
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore comfor@@ t one another with these words .
and the very God of peace sanc@@ ti@@ fy you wh@@ ol@@ ly ; and I pra@@ y God your whole spirit and sou@@ l and body be preserved bla@@ me@@ less un@@ to the coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for n@@ ought ; but w@@ rought with labour and trav@@ ail night and day , that we might not be char@@ ge@@ able to any of you :
now them that are such we command and ex@@ h@@ ort by our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that with qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness they work , and eat their own bread .
now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . the Lord be with you all .
the sal@@ ut@@ ation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the to@@ ken in every ep@@ ist@@ le : so I write .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it for this cause I obtained mer@@ cy , that in me first J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist might she@@ w forth all long@@ suffering , for a pat@@ tern to them which should her@@ e@@ after believe on him to life ever@@ lasting .
for they that have used the office of a de@@ ac@@ on well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great bol@@ d@@ ness in the faith which is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
but refuse prof@@ ane and old wi@@ ves ' f@@ ables , and exercise th@@ y@@ self rather un@@ to go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess .
ti@@ ll I come , give attendance to reading , to ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation , to doc@@ tr@@ ine .
Medi@@ t@@ ate upon these things ; give th@@ y@@ self wh@@ ol@@ ly to them ; that TH@@ Y prof@@ iting may appear to all .
take heed un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , and un@@ to the doc@@ tr@@ ine ; continue in them : for in doing this th@@ ou s@@ halt both save th@@ y@@ self , and them that hear the@@ e .
but she that li@@ vet@@ h in pleas@@ ure is dead while she li@@ vet@@ h .
lay hands su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on no man , neither be par@@ tak@@ er of other men 's sin@@ s : keep th@@ y@@ self p@@ ure .
for the love of money is the root of all ev@@ il : which while some c@@ ov@@ eted after , they have er@@ red from the faith , and pi@@ er@@ ced themselves through with many sor@@ ro@@ ws .
lay@@ ing up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eter@@ nal life .
no man that war@@ re@@ th ent@@ ang@@ le@@ th himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may ple@@ ase him who hat@@ h chosen him to be a soldier .
study to she@@ w th@@ y@@ self approved un@@ to God , a work@@ man that ne@@ ede@@ th not to be as@@ ha@@ med , righ@@ tly dividing the word of truth .
if a man therefore pur@@ ge himself from these , he shall be a ves@@ sel un@@ to honour , sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared un@@ to every good work .
in me@@ ek@@ ness instruc@@ ting those that oppose themselves ; if God per@@ ad@@ venture will give them rep@@ ent@@ ance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
who gave himself for us , that he might re@@ de@@ em us from all in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and pur@@ ify un@@ to himself a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people , z@@ e@@ al@@ ous of good works .
kno@@ wing that he that is such is sub@@ ver@@ ted , and sin@@ net@@ h , being condemned of himself .
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they be not un@@ fruit@@ ful .
I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e for my son O@@ nes@@ im@@ us , whom I have be@@ gotten in my bonds :
whom I have sent again : th@@ ou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bo@@ wel@@ s :
if th@@ ou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : al@@ be@@ it I do not say to the@@ e how th@@ ou ow@@ est un@@ to me even th@@ ine own self besides .
there sal@@ ute the@@ e E@@ pap@@ h@@ ras , my fel@@ low@@ prison@@ er in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us ;
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons un@@ to gl@@ ory , to make the captain of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
but ex@@ h@@ ort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be har@@ dened through the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of sin .
and to whom sw@@ are he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
for un@@ to us was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached , as well as un@@ to them : but the word pre@@ ached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
neither is there any cre@@ ature that is not manif@@ est in his sight : but all things are nak@@ ed and opened un@@ to the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
who can have comp@@ as@@ sion on the ignor@@ ant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is comp@@ ass@@ ed with in@@ fir@@ mity .
and by reason her@@ e@@ of he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sin@@ s .
and no man tak@@ eth this honour un@@ to himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
so also Ch@@ r@@ ist gl@@ ori@@ fied not himself to be made an high pri@@ est ; but he that said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u art my Son , to day have I be@@ gotten the@@ e .
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have she@@ wed toward his name , in that ye have minist@@ ered to the sa@@ ints , and do minister .
for he of whom these things are spoken per@@ tain@@ eth to another tri@@ be , of which no man gave attendance at the alt@@ ar .
( for those pri@@ ests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said un@@ to him , The Lord sw@@ are and will not rep@@ ent , T@@ ho@@ u art a pri@@ est for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ is@@ ede@@ c : )
but into the second went the high pri@@ est alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the err@@ ors of the people :
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high pri@@ est enter@@ eth into the hol@@ y place every year with blood of others ;
but without faith it is impossible to ple@@ ase him : for he that co@@ me@@ th to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dil@@ ig@@ ently seek him .
through faith also Sar@@ a her@@ self received strength to conce@@ ive se@@ ed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she jud@@ ged him fa@@ ith@@ ful who had promised .
let no man say when he is temp@@ ted , I am temp@@ ted of God : for God can@@ not be temp@@ ted with ev@@ il , neither temp@@ te@@ th he any man :
for if any be a hear@@ er of the word , and not a do@@ er , he is like un@@ to a man be@@ holding his natural face in a glass :
p@@ ure religion and un@@ def@@ iled before God and the F@@ ather is this , To visit the fa@@ ther@@ less and wi@@ dows in their aff@@ li@@ ction , and to keep himself un@@ spot@@ ted from the world .
Hear@@ ken , my bel@@ ov@@ ed bre@@ th@@ ren , H@@ ath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and he@@ ir@@ s of the k@@ ing@@ dom which he hat@@ h promised to them that love him ?
Y@@ e ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is en@@ mity with God ? wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
Y@@ e have lived in pleas@@ ure on the ear@@ th , and been wan@@ ton ; ye have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts , as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
Gru@@ dge not one against another , bre@@ th@@ ren , lest ye be condemned : be@@ hold , the judge stan@@ de@@ th before the door .
finally , be ye all of one mind , having comp@@ as@@ sion one of another , love as bre@@ th@@ ren , be p@@ iti@@ ful , be cour@@ te@@ ous :
W@@ her@@ e@@ in they think it st@@ range that ye run not with them to the same exc@@ ess of riot , speaking ev@@ il of you :
and above all things have fer@@ v@@ ent charity among yo@@ ur@@ selves : for charity shall cover the multi@@ tude of sin@@ s .
as every man hat@@ h received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good ste@@ wards of the manif@@ old grace of God .
likewise , ye younger , submit yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the el@@ der . Ye@@ a , all of you be subject one to another , and be clo@@ th@@ ed with hum@@ il@@ ity : for God res@@ iste@@ th the proud , and gi@@ vet@@ h grace to the hum@@ ble .
but the God of all grace , who hat@@ h called us un@@ to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , st@@ ab@@ lish , strengthen , settle you .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the rather , bre@@ th@@ ren , give dil@@ ig@@ ence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
while they promise them liber@@ ty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bon@@ da@@ ge .
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the hol@@ y comman@@ d@@ ment delivered un@@ to them .
and every man that hat@@ h this hope in him pur@@ i@@ fi@@ eth himself , even as he is p@@ ure .
little children , keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from id@@ ols . A@@ men .
Demetri@@ us hat@@ h good report of all men , and of the truth itself : ye@@ a , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
but ye , bel@@ ov@@ ed , building up yo@@ ur@@ selves on your most hol@@ y faith , pray@@ ing in the Holy gh@@ ost ,
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which sear@@ ch@@ eth the re@@ ins and hear@@ ts : and I will give un@@ to every one of you according to your works .
and I saw , and be@@ hold a white hor@@ se : and he that sat on him had a bo@@ w ; and a cro@@ wn was given un@@ to him : and he went forth conqu@@ ering , and to conqu@@ er .
and he had power to give life un@@ to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the be@@ ast should be killed .
and I looked , and , lo , a lam@@ b stood on the mount S@@ ion , and with him an hundred for@@ ty and four thousand , having his F@@ ather 's name written in their fore@@ heads .
and the be@@ ast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and go@@ eth into per@@ di@@ tion .
and the ten hor@@ ns which th@@ ou sa@@ west upon the be@@ ast , these shall h@@ ate the wh@@ ore , and shall make her de@@ so@@ late and nak@@ ed , and shall eat her f@@ les@@ h , and bur@@ n her with fire .
his eyes were as a fla@@ me of fire , and on his head were many crow@@ ns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
