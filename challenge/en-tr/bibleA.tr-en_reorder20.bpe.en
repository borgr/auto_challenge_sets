God said , " Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the birds of the sky , and over the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th . "
to every animal of the ear@@ th , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , in which there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for food " ; and it was so .
out of the ground Yah@@ we@@ h God made every tree to grow that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the middle of the gar@@ den , and the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a de@@ light to the eyes , and that the tree was to be desi@@ red to make one wise , she took of its fruit , and ate ; and she gave some to her husband with her , and he ate .
they heard the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day , and the man and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the gar@@ den .
be@@ hold , you have driven me out this day from the sur@@ face of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . it will happen that who@@ ever finds me will kill me . "
of the birds after their kind , of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every sort shall come to you , to keep them alive .
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , on the same day all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep were bur@@ st open , and the sky 's windows were opened .
they , and every animal after its kind , all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th after its kind , and every bird after its kind , every bird of every sort .
every living thing was destroyed that was on the sur@@ face of the ground , including man , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky . they were destroyed from the ear@@ th . only No@@ ah was left , and those who were with him in the ship .
it happened in the six hundred first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from the ear@@ th . No@@ ah removed the covering of the ship , and looked . he saw that the sur@@ face of the ground was dri@@ ed .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all f@@ les@@ h , including birds , li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ear@@ th , that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply on the ear@@ th . "
the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you will be on every animal of the ear@@ th , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground te@@ em@@ s with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will su@@ rely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
Can@@ a@@ an became the father of S@@ id@@ on ( his fir@@ st@@ born ) , H@@ eth ,
Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , lot the son of Har@@ an , his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife . they went from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . they came to Har@@ an and lived there .
Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , lot his brother 's son , all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s whom they had gotten in Har@@ an , and they went to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an . into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
Is@@ n '@@ t the whole land before you ? ple@@ ase separate yo@@ ur@@ self from me . if you go to the left hand , then I will go to the right . or if you go to the right hand , then I will go to the left . "
that they made war with Ber@@ a , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha , king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house , and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the same day , as God had said to him .
he lifted up his eyes and looked , and saw that three men stood opposite him . when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself to the ear@@ th ,
but he lin@@ gered ; and the men gra@@ bbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ' hands , Yah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ci@@ ful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
see now , your ser@@ vant has found fav@@ or in your sight , and you have mag@@ ni@@ fied your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , which you have shown to me in saving my life . I can '@@ t escape to the mountain , lest ev@@ il over@@ take me , and I die .
it happened , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said to her , ' This is your kin@@ d@@ ness which you shall show to me . everywhere that we go , say of me , " He is my brother . " ' "
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bo@@ w shot away . for she said , " D@@ on '@@ t let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and we@@ pt .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns . Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering instead of his son .
that I will b@@ less you greatly , and I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed greatly like the stars of the heav@@ ens , and like the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your se@@ ed will poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies .
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place . "
now E@@ ph@@ ron was sitting in the middle of the children of H@@ eth . E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the hearing of the children of H@@ eth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
I will make you swe@@ ar by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en and the God of the ear@@ th , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I live .
the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls , of his master 's ca@@ me@@ ls , and depar@@ ted , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der .
be@@ hold , I am standing by this spring of water . let it happen , that the ma@@ iden who comes out to draw , to whom I will say , " P@@ le@@ ase give me a little water from your pit@@ cher to drink , "
it happened , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b had just gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
your se@@ ed will be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your se@@ ed will all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
it happened , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Lab@@ an heard the news of Jac@@ o@@ b , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jac@@ o@@ b , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . Jac@@ o@@ b told Lab@@ an all these things .
that day , he removed the male go@@ ats that were stre@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the female go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
Jac@@ o@@ b separated the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the stre@@ aked and all the black in the flock of Lab@@ an : and he put his own dro@@ ves apart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them into Lab@@ an 's flock .
Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses , and of all the truth , which you have shown to your ser@@ vant ; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I have become two companies .
therefore the children of Israel don '@@ t eat the sin@@ ew of the hip , which is on the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , to this day , because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew of the hip .
ple@@ ase let my lor@@ d pass over before his ser@@ vant , and I will lead on g@@ ently , according to the pace of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lor@@ d to Se@@ ir . "
he bought the par@@ cel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , his sons , his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the members of his household , with his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , all his animals , and all his pos@@ sessions , which he had gathered in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and went into a land away from his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
these are the sons of Re@@ uel , E@@ sa@@ u 's son : chief N@@ ah@@ ath , chief Zer@@ ah , chief Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h , chief M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of Re@@ uel in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a car@@ av@@ an of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes was coming from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ices and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
they both dre@@ amed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
it happened the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the head of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ ic@@ ians and wise men . P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dre@@ ams , but there was no one who could interpre@@ t them to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
there was with us there a young man , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bo@@ wed themselves down to him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
when we came to the lo@@ d@@ ging place , we opened our s@@ acks , and be@@ hold , each man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we ste@@ al silver or gold out of your lor@@ d 's house ?
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near to him , and said , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase let your ser@@ vant speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and don '@@ t let your an@@ ger bur@@ n against your ser@@ vant ; for you are even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Y@@ our servants have been ke@@ epers of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck from our youth even until now , both we , and our fa@@ thers : ' that you may d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; for every she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
they said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no pas@@ ture for your servants ' f@@ loc@@ ks . for the fam@@ ine is severe in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . now therefore , ple@@ ase let your servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en . "
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the gra@@ in which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
they brought their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the her@@ ds , and for the don@@ ke@@ ys : and he f@@ ed them with bread in exchange for all their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck for that year .
it will happen at the har@@ v@@ ests , that you shall give a fifth to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts will be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , for your food , for them of your households , and for food for your little ones . "
as for me , when I came from Pad@@ dan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when there was still some distance to come to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath , and I buried her there in the way to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ( the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ) . "
the an@@ gel who has re@@ deemed me from all ev@@ il , b@@ less the la@@ ds , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fa@@ thers Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac . let them grow into a multi@@ tude in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th . "
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of your an@@ c@@ est@@ ors , above the boundaries of the ancient hil@@ ls . they will be on the head of Joseph , on the cro@@ wn of the head of him who is separated from his brothers .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field , for a possession of a bur@@ ial site , from E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
and he said , " When you perform the duty of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them on the birth st@@ ool ; if it is a son , then you shall kill him ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . "
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ y@@ ru@@ s bas@@ ket for him , and co@@ ated it with tar and with pit@@ ch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
now Mos@@ es was keeping the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro , his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , and he led the flock to the back of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and came to God 's mountain , to Ho@@ re@@ b .
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land , to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
God said moreover to Mos@@ es , " You shall tell the children of Israel this , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , has sent me to you . ' this is my name fore@@ ver , and this is my memorial to all generations .
but every woman shall ask of her neigh@@ bor , and of her who visits her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . "
it will happen , if they will not believe even these two signs , neither listen to your voice , that you shall take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it on the d@@ ry land . the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the d@@ ry land . "
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she b@@ ore him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
go to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning . be@@ hold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent you shall take in your hand .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " In this you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I will strike with the ro@@ d that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the river shall s@@ warm with fro@@ gs , which shall go up and come into your house , and into your bed@@ room , and on your bed , and into the house of your servants , and on your people , and into your ov@@ ens , and into your k@@ ne@@ ading t@@ rough@@ s :
they did so ; and Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and struck the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and there were lice on man , and on animal ; all the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
else , if you will not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies on you , and on your servants , and on your people , and into your houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
Yah@@ we@@ h did so ; and there came gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies .
be@@ hold , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h is on your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which are in the field , on the hor@@ ses , on the don@@ ke@@ ys , on the ca@@ me@@ ls , on the her@@ ds , and on the f@@ loc@@ ks with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
the ha@@ il struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the ha@@ il struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . "
and they shall cover the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , so that one won '@@ t be able to see the ear@@ th . they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which has escaped , which remains to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which gro@@ ws for you out of the field .
your houses shall be filled , and the houses of all your servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; as neither your fa@@ thers nor your fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were on the ear@@ th to this day . ' " he turned , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who s@@ its on his th@@ r@@ one , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female ser@@ vant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
speak to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , ' On the tenth day of this month , they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , a lam@@ b for a household ;
in the first day there shall be to you a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day a hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
there shall be no ye@@ ast found in your houses for seven days , for who@@ ever e@@ ats that which is le@@ av@@ ened , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a foreig@@ ner , or one who is born in the land .
you shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ in , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two do@@ or@@ posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ in ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will pass through to strike the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he sees the blood on the lin@@ tel , and on the two do@@ or@@ posts , Yah@@ we@@ h will pass over the door , and will not allow the destro@@ yer to come in to your houses to strike you .
that you shall say , ' It is the sacrifice of Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he struck the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and spar@@ ed our houses . ' " the people bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
it happened at midnight , that Yah@@ we@@ h struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who sat on his th@@ r@@ one to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive who was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it shall be , when Yah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give you , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that you shall keep this service in this month .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were mar@@ ching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Is@@ n '@@ t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt , saying , ' Le@@ ave us alone , that we may serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ? ' for it were better for us to serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , than that we should die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . "
I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself hon@@ or over P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and over all his armies , over his char@@ i@@ ots , and over his hor@@ se@@ men .
for the hor@@ ses of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and Yah@@ we@@ h brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God . Aaron came with all of the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law before God .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
" you shall not c@@ ov@@ et your neigh@@ bor 's house . you shall not c@@ ov@@ et your neigh@@ bor 's wife , nor his male ser@@ vant , nor his female ser@@ vant , nor his o@@ x , nor his don@@ key , nor anything that is your neigh@@ bor 's . "

if he rises again and walk@@ s around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his he@@ aling until he is thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
but if the bul@@ l had a ha@@ bit of gor@@ ing in the past , and it has been testified to its owner , and he has not kept it in , but it has killed a man or a woman , the bul@@ l shall be st@@ oned , and its owner shall also be put to death .

I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to the River ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and you shall drive them out before you .

I , be@@ hold , I have appointed with him O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan ; and in the heart of all who are wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted I have put wis@@ dom , that they may make all that I have comman@@ ded you :
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them . they have made themselves a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ ped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to it , and said , ' These are your go@@ ds , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . ' "
why should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , saying , ' He brought them forth for ev@@ il , to kill them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ? ' turn from your fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against your people .
it happened , as soon as he came near to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger grew hot , and he threw the tab@@ lets out of his hands , and broke them ben@@ e@@ ath the mountain .
for they said to me , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us ; for as for this Mos@@ es , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
he said to them , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Every man put his s@@ word on his th@@ igh , and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp , and every man kill his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neigh@@ bor . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , " de@@ part , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . '
now Mos@@ es used to take the tent and to pit@@ ch it outside the camp , far away from the camp , and he called it " The tent of Meet@@ ing . " it happened that everyone who sought Yah@@ we@@ h went out to the tent of Meet@@ ing , which was outside the camp .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part out of the tent .

the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the family of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel :
when the ju@@ bil@@ ee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inher@@ it@@ ance be added to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be where@@ un@@ to they shall belong : so will their inher@@ it@@ ance be taken away from the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of our fa@@ thers . "
it happened in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment to them ;
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
moreover your little ones , whom you said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , who this day have no knowledge of good or ev@@ il , they shall go in there , and to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
you shall purchase food of them for money , that you may eat ; and you shall also buy water of them for money , that you may drink . ' "
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky , who shall hear the report of you , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of you . "
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the val@@ ley , even to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not a city too high for us ; Yah@@ we@@ h our God delivered up all before us :
( for only O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an remained of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im ; be@@ hold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is@@ n '@@ t it in R@@ ab@@ bah of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cu@@ bi@@ ts was its length , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts its b@@ read@@ th , after the cu@@ bit of a man . )
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , even all B@@ ash@@ an . ( the same is called the land of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even to the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , the middle of the val@@ ley , and its border , even to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
only take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self , and keep your sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest you forget the things which your eyes saw , and lest they de@@ part from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your children and your children 's children ;
you shall remember that you were a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God brought you out of there by a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by an out@@ stret@@ ched arm : therefore Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded you to keep the Sab@@ b@@ ath day .
it happened , when you heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , while the mountain was burning with fire , that you came near to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and you said , " be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h our God has shown us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God does speak with man , and he lives .
Yah@@ we@@ h heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
that you might fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
and you shall te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the mid@@ st of you is a Je@@ al@@ ous God ; lest the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h your God be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the ear@@ th .
remember , don '@@ t forget , how you provoked Yah@@ we@@ h your God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against Yah@@ we@@ h .
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you on the mountain out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them to me .
and what he did to the army of Egypt , to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red Sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how Yah@@ we@@ h has destroyed them to this day ;
for the land , where you go in to poss@@ ess it , is@@ n '@@ t as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you so@@ wed your se@@ ed , and wat@@ ered it with your fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs ;
and the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you per@@ ish quickly from off the good land which Yah@@ we@@ h gives you .
every place where@@ on the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even to the hin@@ der sea shall be your border .
and the cur@@ se , if you shall not listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which you have not known .
these are the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces which you shall observe to do in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , has given you to poss@@ ess it , all the days that you live on the ear@@ th .
then it shall happen that to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there , there you shall bring all that I command you : your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the wave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which you vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h .
you may not eat within your gates the ti@@ the of your gra@@ in , or of your new wine , or of your oil , or the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d or of your flock , nor any of your vows which you vo@@ w , nor your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , nor the wave offering of your hand ;
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall en@@ large your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your sou@@ l desi@@ res to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
if the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to put his name there , is too far from you , then you shall kill of your her@@ d and of your flock , which Yah@@ we@@ h has given you , as I have comman@@ ded you ; and you may eat within your gates , after all the desire of your sou@@ l .
and you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and the blood of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; and you shall eat the f@@ les@@ h .
you shall not do so to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , which he ha@@ tes , have they done to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters do they bur@@ n in the fire to their go@@ ds .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , of which he spoke to you , saying , " Let us go after other go@@ ds " ( which you have not known ) " and let us serve them " ;
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then you shall inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in the mid@@ st of you ,
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not har@@ den your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
you shall su@@ rely give him , and your heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when you give to him ; because that for this thing Yah@@ we@@ h your God will b@@ less you in all your work , and in all that you put your hand to .
but at the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well in , there you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male ser@@ vant , and your female ser@@ vant , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , who are within your gates .
if there is found in the mid@@ st of you , within any of your gates which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
then you shall bring forth that man or that woman , who has done this ev@@ il thing , to your gates , even the man or the woman ; and you shall stone them to death with stones .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
if there ar@@ ises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose ;
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall te@@ ach you :
according to the tenor of the law which they shall te@@ ach you , and according to the judgment which they shall tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you , to the right hand , nor to the left .
the man who does pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , in not list@@ ening to the pri@@ est who stands to minister there before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers , and that he not turn aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
this shall be the pri@@ ests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep , that they shall give to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
this is according to all that you desi@@ red of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , who shall speak a word pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , that same pro@@ phe@@ t shall die . "
when you go forth to battle against your enem@@ ies , and see hor@@ ses , char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint cap@@ tains of armies at the head of the people .
but the women , and the little ones , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that is in the city , even all its sp@@ oil , you shall take for a pre@@ y to yo@@ ur@@ self ; and you shall eat the sp@@ oil of your enem@@ ies , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
and it shall be , that the city which is near@@ est to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take a he@@ if@@ er of the her@@ d , which has@@ n '@@ t been worked with , and which has not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
it shall be , if you have no de@@ light in her , then you shall let her go where she will ; but you shall not sell her at all for money , you shall not deal with her as a sla@@ ve , because you have hum@@ b@@ led her .
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inher@@ it that which he has , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed the fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , who is the fir@@ st@@ born :
so you shall do with his don@@ key ; and so you shall do with his gar@@ ment ; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother 's , which he has lost , and you have found : you may not hide yo@@ ur@@ self .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eg@@ gs , and the h@@ en sitting on the young , or on the eg@@ gs , you shall not take the h@@ en with the young :
and acc@@ uses her of sha@@ me@@ ful things , and brings up an ev@@ il name on her , and says , " I took this woman , and when I came near to her , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find in her the to@@ ken@@ s of vir@@ gin@@ ity " ;
but it shall be , when evening comes on , he shall ba@@ the himself in water ; and when the sun is down , he shall come within the camp .
he shall d@@ well with you , in the mid@@ st of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it ple@@ ases him best : you shall not op@@ press him .
to a foreig@@ ner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God may b@@ less you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
that which is gone out of your li@@ ps you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , a fre@@ e@@ will offering , which you have promised with your m@@ outh .
when a man takes a wife , and mar@@ ries her , then it shall be , if she find no fav@@ or in his eyes , because he has found some un@@ seem@@ ly thing in her , that he shall write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h : and you shall not cause the land to sin , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his brothers of the children of Israel , and he deal with him as a sla@@ ve , or sell him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , by number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then your brother should seem v@@ ile to you .
that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which you shall bring in from your land that Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you ; and you shall put it in a bas@@ ket , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
you shall come to the pri@@ est who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I prof@@ ess this day to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , that I am come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers to give us . "
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , that you shall set yo@@ ur@@ self up great stones , and plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter :
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount E@@ bal , and you shall plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter .
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , that Yah@@ we@@ h your God will set you on high above all the nations of the ear@@ th :
Yah@@ we@@ h will make you the head , and not the ta@@ il ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be ben@@ e@@ ath ; if you shall listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
your o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before your eyes , and you shall not eat of it : your don@@ key shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before your face , and shall not be restored to you : your she@@ ep shall be given to your enem@@ ies , and you shall have none to save you .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bo@@ il , of which you can not be he@@ aled , from the sole of your fo@@ ot to the cro@@ wn of your head .
they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates , until your high and for@@ ti@@ fied walls come down , in which you tr@@ usted , throughout all your land ; and they shall bes@@ i@@ ege you in all your gates throughout all your land , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the f@@ les@@ h of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given you , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress with which your enemy shall dist@@ ress you in all your gates .
it shall happen that as Yah@@ we@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you , so Yah@@ we@@ h will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to cause you to per@@ ish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
that he may establish you this day to himself for a people , and that he may be to you a God , as he spoke to you , and as he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreig@@ ner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses with which Yah@@ we@@ h has made it si@@ ck ;
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to their fa@@ thers , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and grown f@@ at ; then will they turn to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and desp@@ ise me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God . they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities . I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those who are not a people . I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
" go up into this mountain of A@@ bar@@ im , to Mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and see the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
because you t@@ res@@ passed against me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " This is the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , ' I will give it to your se@@ ed . ' I have caused you to see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . "
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of your m@@ outh , but you shall medi@@ t@@ ate on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then you shall make your way prosperous , and then you shall have good success .
it happened about the time of the sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don '@@ t know . pursue them quickly ; for you will over@@ take them . "
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , you shall bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which you used to let us down . you shall gather to yo@@ ur@@ self into the house your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your father 's household .
Jos@@ hua said , " Her@@ e@@ by you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite out from before you .
and when those who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had come to the Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k had di@@ pped in the edge of the water ( for the Jordan over@@ flows all its banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est ) ,
it happened , when the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h had come up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up to the d@@ ry ground , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and went over all its banks , as before .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God dri@@ ed up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God did to the Red Sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we had passed over ;
this is the reason Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the next day , after they had e@@ aten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have man@@ na any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
the city shall be devoted , even it and all that is in it , to Yah@@ we@@ h . only Ra@@ ha@@ b the pro@@ stitute shall live , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
the young men who were sp@@ ies went in , and brought out Ra@@ ha@@ b with her father , her mother , her brothers , and all that she had . they also brought out all her relatives , and they set them outside of the camp of Israel .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the devoted things ; for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took some of the devoted things . therefore Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger burned against the children of Israel .
it shall be , that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he has , because he has trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because he has done a dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful thing in Israel . ' "
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I have comman@@ ded you . "
all the people , even the men of war who were with him , went up , and drew near , and came before the city , and en@@ camp@@ ed on the north side of A@@ I . now there was a val@@ ley between him and A@@ I .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
the others came out of the city against them , so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side . they struck them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
it happened , when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in which they pursu@@ ed them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all Israel returned to A@@ I , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word .
it happened , when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country , and in the low@@ land , and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite , heard of it
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and en@@ camp@@ ed against Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining . he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered it also , with its king , into the hand of Israel . he struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining in it . he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
they took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , with its king and all its cities , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it . he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed it , and all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it .
the children of Israel took all the sp@@ oil of these cities , with the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as sp@@ o@@ ils for themselves ; but every man they struck with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave any who bre@@ ath@@ ed .
their border was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
" now , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has kept me alive , as he spoke , these for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years , from the time that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke this word to Mos@@ es , while Israel walked in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . now , be@@ hold , I am eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years old , today .
as yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now for war , to go out and to come in .
the border went up to De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river . the border passed along to the waters of En She@@ mes@@ h , and ended at En Ro@@ gel .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount J@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
and the border went out to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border extended to Shi@@ k@@ ker@@ on , and passed along to Mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out at J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
so this was for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families : for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph according to their families .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had three he@@ ights in Is@@ sac@@ har , in As@@ her Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and its towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns .
the border passed along from there to L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz ( the same is Be@@ the@@ l ) , sou@@ th@@ ward . the border went down to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Hor@@ on the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter sou@@ th@@ ward , from the mountain that lies before Beth Hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and ended at Kiri@@ ath Ba@@ al ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h . this was the west quarter .
out of the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon ; for the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them . therefore the children of Simeon had inher@@ it@@ ance in the mid@@ st of their inher@@ it@@ ance .
the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites . the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , who were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , out of the tri@@ be of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin .
the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had thir@@ teen cities by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an .
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi ; for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
they gave to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with its subur@@ bs , the city of ref@@ uge for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , and Be E@@ sh@@ ter@@ ah with its subur@@ bs ; two cities .
when they came to the region about the Jordan , that is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by the Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to look at .
the children of Israel heard this , " be@@ hold , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the region about the Jordan , on the side that per@@ tains to the children of Israel . "
the children of Israel sent to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
they came to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they spoke with them , saying ,
" if we have not out of concern done this , and for a reason , saying , ' In time to come your children might speak to our children , saying , " What have you to do with Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ?
when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h spoke , it pleased them well .
Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
" ' you went over the Jordan , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o . the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ or@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the H@@ itti@@ te , the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite ; and I delivered them into your hand .
the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which is in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and lived with the people .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Sh@@ ean and its towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and its towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and its towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and its towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and its towns ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth An@@ ath ; but he lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth She@@ mes@@ h and of Beth An@@ ath became subject to forced la@@ bor .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him . he said , " I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you to the land which I s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , ' I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you :
and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the peoples who were around them , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : and they provoked Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers who desp@@ o@@ iled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
yet they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to their judges ; for they played the pro@@ stitute after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fa@@ thers walked , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do so .
they w@@ aited until they were as@@ ha@@ med ; and be@@ hold , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open the doors of the up@@ per room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
far from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers , in the places of drawing water , there they will re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of Yah@@ we@@ h , the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of his rule in Israel . " then the people of Yah@@ we@@ h went down to the gates .
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken to him : and it happened , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household and the men of the city , so that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was broken down , and the Ash@@ er@@ ah was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ l was offered on the alt@@ ar that was built .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol on the th@@ res@@ hing floor ; if there is dew on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it is d@@ ry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and en@@ camp@@ ed bes@@ ide the spring of Har@@ od : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
and you shall hear what they say ; and after@@ ward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Pur@@ ah his ser@@ vant to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the armed men who were in the camp .
it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and its interpre@@ tation , that he wor@@ shi@@ ped ; and he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , " arise ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has delivered the army of Mi@@ dian into your hand ! "
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , sev@@ enty persons , on one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his female ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ) ;
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early , and rush on the city ; and be@@ hold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , then may you do to them as you shall find occasion . "
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and be@@ hold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
all the people likewise each cut down his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them at the base of the stron@@ gh@@ old , and set the stron@@ gh@@ old on fire on them ; so that all the people of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and served the Ba@@ als , and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of S@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t serve him .
while Israel lived in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and its towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and its towns , and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Ar@@ non , three hundred years ; why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you rec@@ over them within that time ?
then it shall be , that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , it shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering . "
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were gathered together , and passed nor@@ th@@ ward ; and they said to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , " Wh@@ y did you pass over to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t call us to go with you ? we will bur@@ n your house around you with fire ! "
when I saw that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
for , be@@ hold , you shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son ; and no ra@@ zor shall come on his head ; for the child shall be a Naz@@ ir@@ ite to God from the w@@ om@@ b : and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
for it happened , when the fla@@ me went up toward the sky from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar : and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on ; and they fell on their faces to the ground .
they said to him , " We have come down to bin@@ d you , that we may deliver you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . " Sam@@ son said to them , " swe@@ ar to me that you will not fall on me yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
it happened , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , " C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may enter@@ tain us . " they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pil@@ lars ;
the man depar@@ ted out of the city , out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he trav@@ eled .
when they were a good way from the house of Mic@@ ah , the men who were in the houses near to Mic@@ ah 's house were gathered together , and over@@ took the children of Dan .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the en@@ gra@@ ved image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Mos@@ es , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
it happened on the fourth day , that they ar@@ ose early in the morning , and he rose up to de@@ part : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to his son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Str@@ eng@@ then your heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward you shall go your way . "
so they sat down , ate , and d@@ rank , both of them together : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to the man , " P@@ le@@ ase be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
but the man wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stay that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus ( the same is Jer@@ usalem ) : and there were with him a couple of don@@ ke@@ ys s@@ add@@ led ; his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
they turned aside there , to go in to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lo@@ dge .
be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
when he had come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , lim@@ b by lim@@ b , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel .
now therefore deliver up the men , the base fel@@ lows , who are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . " but Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel .
but when the cl@@ oud began to arise up out of the city in a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them ; and be@@ hold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its mid@@ st .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , both the entire city , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of those who dan@@ ced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inher@@ it@@ ance , built the cities , and lived in them .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that Yah@@ we@@ h had visited his people in giving them bread .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
go back , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have a husband . if I should say , ' I have hope , ' if I should even have a husband ton@@ ight , and should also bear sons ;
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim Z@@ op@@ him , of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of To@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite :
therefore you shall make images of your t@@ um@@ ors , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and you shall give gl@@ ory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
the co@@ ws took the stra@@ ight way by the way to Beth She@@ mes@@ h ; they went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them to the border of Beth She@@ mes@@ h .
the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , in which the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth She@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day to Yah@@ we@@ h .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and they shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots ;
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , the son of a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or .
as for your don@@ ke@@ ys who were lost three days ago , don '@@ t set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desi@@ ra@@ ble in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
they ar@@ ose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Sa@@ ul on the hous@@ et@@ op , saying , " G@@ et up , that I may send you away . " Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
" but they for@@ got Yah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b ; and they fought against them .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it ( for the people were dist@@ ressed ) , then the people hi@@ d themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in cover@@ ts , and in p@@ its .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might gre@@ et him .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it fell on a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said to the young man who b@@ ore his arm@@ or , " C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . " but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell his father .
between the passes , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the one side , and a ro@@ cky c@@ rag on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
now the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
but Jon@@ athan di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear when his father comman@@ ded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d who was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
now when Sa@@ ul had taken the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , he fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and wher@@ ever he turned himself , he defeated them .
Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning ; and it was told Samuel , saying , " Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and be@@ hold , he set up a monument for himself , and turned , and passed on , and went down to G@@ ilg@@ al . "
David said , " Yah@@ we@@ h who delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . " Sa@@ ul said to David , " G@@ o ; and Yah@@ we@@ h shall be with you . "
he took his staff in his hand , and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in his wal@@ let . his s@@ ling was in his hand ; and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and s@@ lun@@ g it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head ; and the stone san@@ k into his fore@@ head , and he fell on his face to the ear@@ th .
then David ran , and stood over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of its she@@ ath , and killed him , and cut off his head there@@ with . when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
the men of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ar@@ ose , and sh@@ ou@@ ted , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , until you come to G@@ ai , and to the gates of E@@ kr@@ on . the wounded of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fell down by the way to Sha@@ ar@@ aim , even to G@@ ath , and to E@@ kr@@ on .
Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clo@@ thing , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his s@@ ash .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
though men may rise up to pursue you , and to seek your sou@@ l , yet the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with Yah@@ we@@ h your God . he will s@@ ling out the so@@ ul@@ s of your enem@@ ies , as from the hol@@ low of a s@@ ling .
that this shall be no gri@@ ef to you , nor offen@@ se of heart to my lor@@ d , either that you have shed blood without cause , or that my lor@@ d has av@@ en@@ ged himself . when Yah@@ we@@ h has dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember your hand@@ ma@@ id . "
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " G@@ o up in peace to your house . be@@ hold , I have list@@ ened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken . therefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had en@@ camp@@ ed ; and David saw the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his army : and Sa@@ ul lay within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , and the people were en@@ camp@@ ed around him .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul lay sle@@ eping within the place of the w@@ ag@@ ons , with his spe@@ ar st@@ uck in the ground at his head ; and Ab@@ ner and the people lay around him .
it happened in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . A@@ ch@@ ish said to David , " K@@ now assu@@ red@@ ly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
the woman said to him , " be@@ hold , you know what Sa@@ ul has done , how he has cut off those who have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land . why then do you lay a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ? "
the woman came to Sa@@ ul , and saw that he was very troubled , and said to him , " be@@ hold , your hand@@ ma@@ id has list@@ ened to your voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have list@@ ened to your words which you spoke to me .
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lor@@ d who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part . "
it happened , when David and his men had come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had made a raid on the South , and on Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and had struck Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ,
they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins@@ . when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth S@@ han ; and they came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
it happened on the third day , that be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul , with his clo@@ th@@ es torn , and ear@@ th on his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and showed respect .
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until evening , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " b@@ les@@ sed are you by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kin@@ d@@ ness to your lor@@ d , even to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met them by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on ; and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
now then do it ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken of David , saying , ' By the hand of my ser@@ vant David , I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies . ' "
it was so , as the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sle@@ ep with your fa@@ thers , I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall proceed out of your bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they were become odi@@ ous to David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syri@@ ans of Beth Re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah with one thousand men , and the men of To@@ b twelve thousand men .
the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ ah and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and the men of To@@ b and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
it happened at evening , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked on the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman ba@@ thing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
when they had told David , saying , " U@@ ri@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house , " David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you come from a journey ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you go down to your house ? "
why have you desp@@ ised the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , to do that which is ev@@ il in his sight ? you have struck U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te with the s@@ word , and have taken his wife to be your wife , and have sla@@ in him with the s@@ word of the children of Am@@ mon .
" this is what Yah@@ we@@ h says : ' be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wi@@ ves before your eyes , and give them to your neigh@@ bor , and he will lie with your wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
he took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a tal@@ ent of gold , and in it were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and t@@ ore her gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , cr@@ ying al@@ oud as she went .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' I will now speak to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his ser@@ vant . '
then your hand@@ ma@@ id said , ' P@@ le@@ ase let the word of my lor@@ d the king bring rest ; for as an an@@ gel of God , so is my lor@@ d the king to dis@@ cer@@ n good and bad . May Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , be with you . ' "
Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and b@@ les@@ sed the king . Jo@@ a@@ b said , " Today your ser@@ vant knows that I have found fav@@ or in your sight , my lor@@ d , king , in that the king has performed the request of his ser@@ vant . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
when he cut the ha@@ ir of his head ( now it was at every year 's end that he cut it ; because it was heavy on him , therefore he cut it ) ; he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els , after the king 's weight .
be@@ hold , Zad@@ ok also came , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God ; and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
David went up by the as@@ cent of the Mount of ol@@ ives , and we@@ pt as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
D@@ on '@@ t you have Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul came out , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a . he came out , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t ; for all Israel knows that your father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
so shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one .
when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his don@@ key , and ar@@ ose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and han@@ ged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , " You have sha@@ med this day the faces of all your servants , who this day have sav@@ ed your life , and the lives of your sons and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of your wi@@ ves , and the lives of your conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
the three m@@ igh@@ ty men broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the army . Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the army went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men who drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
most certainly as I s@@ wor@@ e to you by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , ' As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my th@@ r@@ one in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away to A@@ ch@@ ish , son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah , king of G@@ ath . they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , " be@@ hold , your servants are in G@@ ath . "
it happened the third day after I delivered , that this woman delivered also . we were together . there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , just us two in the house .
then the king said , " The one says , ' This is my son who lives , and your son is the dead ; ' and the other says , ' No ; but your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ' "
it happened in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zi@@ v , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the ne@@ ther@@ most story was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; for on the outside he made off@@ sets in the wall of the house all around , that the be@@ ams should not have hold in the walls of the house .
" concerning this house which you are building , if you will walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I establish my word with you , which I spoke to David your father .
he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar : from the floor of the house to the walls of the ce@@ iling , he covered them on the inside with wood ; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of f@@ ir .
five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m within the in@@ ner house ; and the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were stret@@ ched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
he made two capitals of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set on the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other capital was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he set up the pil@@ lars at the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard , toward the south .
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the c@@ ups , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , of the temp@@ le , of gold .
thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated , the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , who were assemb@@ led to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
Yah@@ we@@ h has established his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and I sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which you have said , ' My name shall be there ; ' to listen to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant shall pra@@ y toward this place .
then hear in heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head , and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tive to the land of the enemy , far off or near ;
yet if they shall rep@@ ent in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of those who carried them cap@@ tive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely ; we have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their enem@@ ies , who carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y to you toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , the city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name :
and for@@ give your people who have sin@@ ned against you , and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions in which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against you ; and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before those who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread forth toward heav@@ en .
let these my words , with which I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before Yah@@ we@@ h , be near to Yah@@ we@@ h our God day and night , that he may maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel , as every day shall require ;
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , to do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made hol@@ y for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and that which Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty ; and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
therefore Yah@@ we@@ h said to Solomon , " Bec@@ ause this is done by you , and you have not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded you , I will su@@ rely tear the k@@ ing@@ dom from you , and will give it to your ser@@ vant .
they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an ; and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , who gave him a house , and appointed him food , and gave him land .
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell this people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter to us ; ' you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
if this people goes up to offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lor@@ d , even to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they will kill me , and return to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h . "
now there lived an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
but came back , and have e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place of which he said to you , " eat no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fa@@ thers . ' "
the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old pro@@ phe@@ t to mour@@ n , and to bur@@ y him .
and t@@ ore the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
for the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provoc@@ ation with which he provoked Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger .
it happened , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he struck all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave him a single one who ur@@ in@@ ates on a wall , neither of his relatives , nor of his friends .
it happened , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the castle of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin@@ s with which he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he showed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took as wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . be@@ hold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ? "
it shall happen , that he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el , J@@ eh@@ u will kill ; and he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u , E@@ lis@@ ha will kill .
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time , and they shall search your house , and the houses of your servants ; and it shall be , that whatever is pleas@@ ant in your eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away . " ' "
the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who lived in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on you , and will ut@@ ter@@ ly swe@@ ep you away and will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make your house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah for the provoc@@ ation with which you have provoked me to an@@ ger , and have made Israel to sin . "
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " su@@ rely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he walked in all the way of A@@ SA his father ; He di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he showed , and how he war@@ red , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , in which he made Israel to sin .
then the king sent a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty to him . he went up to him ; and be@@ hold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . he said to him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' C@@ ome down ! ' "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his m@@ outh on his m@@ outh , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stret@@ ched himself on him ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child grew warm .
E@@ lis@@ ha came again to G@@ ilg@@ al . there was a fam@@ ine in the land ; and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets were sitting before him ; and he said to his ser@@ vant , " S@@ et on the great po@@ t , and bo@@ il ste@@ w for the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . "
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . it happened , as they were e@@ ating of the ste@@ w , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , " Man of God , there is death in the po@@ t ! " they could not eat of it .
it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , " Wh@@ y have you torn your clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel . "
it happened , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es ( now he was passing by on the wall ) ; and the people looked , and be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th under@@ ne@@ ath on his f@@ les@@ h .
they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go to the camp of the Syri@@ ans . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syri@@ ans , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish . I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent them to him to J@@ ez@@ reel .
J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel ; and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was filled from one end to another .
however from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from after them , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but J@@ eh@@ u took no heed to walk in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin .
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
the cap@@ tains over hundreds did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded ; and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " Br@@ ing her out between the ranks . kill him who follows her with the s@@ word . " for the pri@@ est said , " D@@ on '@@ t let her be sla@@ in in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
all the people of the land went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images broke they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he took the cap@@ tains over hundreds , and the Car@@ ites , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est took a ch@@ est , and bo@@ red a hol@@ e in its li@@ d , and set it bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and the pri@@ ests who kept the threshold put there@@ in all the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work , who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they paid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and the buil@@ ders , who worked on the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked there@@ in .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
it happened , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band ; and they cast the man into the tomb of E@@ lis@@ ha : and as soon as the man touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
now the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , and his might , how he war@@ red , and how he recovered Dam@@ as@@ cus , and Ham@@ ath , which had belonged to Ju@@ da@@ h , for Israel , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as his fa@@ thers had done : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part all his days from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th P@@ il@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , " I am your ser@@ vant and your son . come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who rise up against me . "
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
the bronze alt@@ ar , which was before Yah@@ we@@ h , he brought from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between his alt@@ ar and the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and put it on the north side of his alt@@ ar .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ va , and from Ham@@ ath and Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel ; and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and lived in the cities of it .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great army to Jer@@ usalem . they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . when they had come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
now , be@@ hold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even in Egypt . if a man le@@ ans on it , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it . so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded . they were like the gr@@ ass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like gra@@ in b@@ lasted before it has grown up .
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came . "
it happened that night , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out , and struck one hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made the pool , and the con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he made his son to pass through the fire , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Y@@ our servants have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who have the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ) ; and they talked with her .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the work of their hands , therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' "
'@@ T@@ her@@ e@@ fore be@@ hold , I will gather you to your fa@@ thers , and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace , neither shall your eyes see all the ev@@ il which I will bring on this place . ' " ' " they brought back this message to the king .
he brought out the Ash@@ er@@ ah from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , outside of Jer@@ usalem , to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and beat it to d@@ ust , and cast its d@@ ust on the graves of the common people .
moreover the alt@@ ar that was at Be@@ the@@ l , and the high place which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , had made , even that alt@@ ar and the high place he broke down ; and he burned the high place and beat it to d@@ ust , and burned the Ash@@ er@@ ah .
all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
like him was there no king before him , who turned to Yah@@ we@@ h with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own tomb . the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's place .
Yah@@ we@@ h sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , as Yah@@ we@@ h had said .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to Jer@@ usalem .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke up the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and carried the br@@ ass pieces to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
as for the people who were left in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , governor .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ite , they and their men .
but it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the royal se@@ ed came , and ten men with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
it happened in the seven and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the cap@@ tivity of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , on the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , that E@@ vil@@ mer@@ od@@ ach king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in king of Ju@@ da@@ h out of prison ;
some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to Mount Se@@ ir , having for their cap@@ tains Pe@@ la@@ ti@@ ah , and N@@ ear@@ i@@ ah , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , the sons of I@@ sh@@ i .
these were the sons of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il , the son of Hur@@ i , the son of Jar@@ o@@ ah , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Michael , the son of J@@ es@@ his@@ hai , the son of Jah@@ do , the son of B@@ uz ;
the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of val@@ i@@ ant men , men able to bear bu@@ ck@@ ler and s@@ word , and to sho@@ ot with bo@@ w , and s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in war , were for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand seven hundred and six@@ ty , that were able to go forth to war .
now these are their d@@ wel@@ ling places according to their en@@ camp@@ ments in their borders : to the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites ( for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot ) ,
to the rest of the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h were given by lot , out of the family of the tri@@ be , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be , the half of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
to the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m , according to their families , out of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
to the sons of Mer@@ ari were given by lot , according to their families , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
they gave by lot out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin , these cities which are mentioned by name .
the sons of Tola : Uz@@ zi , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Jer@@ i@@ el , and Jah@@ ma@@ i , and I@@ b@@ sam , and Sh@@ em@@ uel , heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses , of Tola ; m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or in their generations : their number in the days of David was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand six hundred .
all these were sons of J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , according to the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , se@@ ven@@ teen thousand and two hundred , who were able to go forth in the army for war .
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of A@@ SA , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , who lived in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
the three broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to Yah@@ we@@ h ,
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done m@@ igh@@ ty de@@ eds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and killed a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow .
now these are those who came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish ; and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , his hel@@ pers in war .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
and said to them , " You are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes . San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you have gone , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fa@@ thers , that I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
King David also dedicated these to Yah@@ we@@ h , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set on David 's head : and he brought forth the sp@@ oil of the city , exceeding much .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew s@@ word : and in Ju@@ da@@ h were four hundred sev@@ enty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after their fa@@ thers ' houses , even the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , from twenty years old and up@@ ward .
for their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , even the work of the service of God 's house ;
there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen , heads of fa@@ thers ' houses ; and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , eight .
this was their or@@ dering in their service , to come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h according to the ordin@@ ance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had comman@@ ded him .
moreover , David and the cap@@ tains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of those who did the work according to their service was :
this S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the army , had dedicated .
all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated , who@@ ever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th , and of his brothers .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even of the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to their generations by fa@@ thers ' households . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le , and of its houses , and of its treas@@ ur@@ ies , and of the up@@ per rooms of it , and of the in@@ ner rooms of it , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ;
also for the divisions of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and for all the work of the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
by weight also for the lam@@ p@@ stands of gold , and for its lam@@ ps , of gold , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps ; and for the lam@@ p@@ stands of silver , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lam@@ ps , according to the use of every lam@@ p@@ stand ;
in addition , because I have set my aff@@ ection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of ar@@ tis@@ ans . who then offers will@@ ingly to consec@@ rate himself this day to Yah@@ we@@ h ? "
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your comman@@ d@@ ments , your testimon@@ ies , and your stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the history of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tent of Meet@@ ing of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
they brought up and brought out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred pieces of silver , and a hor@@ se for one hundred fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the kings of Syria , they brought them out by their means .
he set up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
the two pil@@ lars , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the two capitals which were on the top of the pil@@ lars , and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ,
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ins , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of p@@ ure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors of it for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the main hall of the temp@@ le were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was finished . Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated , even the silver , and the gold , and all the vessels , and put them in the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of the children of Israel , to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
" Yah@@ we@@ h has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as Yah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
then hear from heav@@ en , and do , and judge your servants , bringing re@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way on his own head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you te@@ ach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then hear from heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place and for@@ give , and ren@@ der to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hear@@ ts of the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; when they shall come and pra@@ y toward this house :
yet if they shall rep@@ ent themselves in the land where they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn again , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation to you in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , we have done per@@ ver@@ sely , and have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; '
if they return to you with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , where they have carried them cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y toward their land , which you gave to their fa@@ thers , and the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name :
thus Solomon finished the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in his own house .
if my people , who are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and all that Solomon desi@@ red to build for his pleas@@ ure in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , three times in the year , in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of ten@@ ts .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and be@@ hold , the half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of your wis@@ dom was not told me : you exceed the f@@ ame that I heard .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the history of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er concerning Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him , saying , " Th@@ us you shall tell the people who spoke to you , saying , ' Y@@ our father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make it ligh@@ ter on us ; ' thus you shall say to them , ' My little fin@@ ger is th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's wa@@ ist .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get himself up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house . he took it all away . he also took away the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
A@@ SA and the people who were with him pursu@@ ed them to Ger@@ ar : and there fell of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians so many that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before Yah@@ we@@ h , and before his army ; and they carried away very much bo@@ o@@ ty .
at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said to him , " Bec@@ ause you have reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and have not reli@@ ed on Yah@@ we@@ h your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
now the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , ar@@ ray@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets were pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying before them .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and Yah@@ we@@ h helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the Lev@@ ite , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , in the mid@@ st of the assembly ;
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem to play the pro@@ stitute , like the house of A@@ ha@@ b did , and also have sla@@ in your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yo@@ ur@@ self :
and they came up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and broke into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , except Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment on the house of A@@ ha@@ b , that he found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the brothers of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , minist@@ ering to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , and killed them .
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
the L@@ evi@@ tes shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . who@@ ever comes into the house , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men , those who were to come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; with those who were to go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ; for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dismiss the shift .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came through the up@@ per gate to the king 's house , and set the king on the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to restore the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and also such as worked iron and br@@ ass to repair the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened at the end of the year , that the army of the Syri@@ ans came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all their sp@@ oil to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now it happened , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se to them .
he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and broke down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d ; and he built cities in the country of Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
then some of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against those who came from the war ,
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines also had inv@@ aded the cities of the low@@ land , and of the South of Ju@@ da@@ h , and had taken Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and G@@ eder@@ o@@ th , and So@@ co with its towns , and Tim@@ n@@ ah with its towns , G@@ imz@@ o also and its towns : and they lived there .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and out of the house of the king and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t help him .
A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
the pri@@ ests went in to the in@@ ner part of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le into the court of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in eight days : and on the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleans@@ ed all the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
so they killed the bul@@ ls , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : and they killed the r@@ ams , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood on the alt@@ ar .
all the assembly of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , who lived in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of c@@ attle and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of dedicated things which were consec@@ rated to Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
after this , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( now he was before L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him ) , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all Ju@@ da@@ h who were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
D@@ on '@@ t you know what I and my fa@@ thers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations which my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jer@@ usalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
he also made his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m ; and he prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and prac@@ ticed sor@@ cer@@ y , and dealt with those who had familiar spir@@ its , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he worked much ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
he took away the foreign go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers who spoke to him in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel .
his pray@@ er also , and how God was ent@@ re@@ ated of him , and all his sin and his t@@ res@@ pass , and the places in which he built high places , and set up the Ash@@ er@@ im and the en@@ gra@@ ved images , before he hum@@ b@@ led himself : be@@ hold , they are written in the history of Ho@@ zai .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and into the hand of the work@@ men . "
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they whom the king had comman@@ ded , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Tok@@ hat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she lived in Jer@@ usalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore is my wr@@ ath p@@ oured out on this place , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched . ' " '
stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fa@@ thers ' house of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the children of the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and young go@@ ats , all of them for the P@@ ass@@ over offer@@ ings , to all who were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ ls : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Yah@@ we@@ h , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . so they did with the c@@ attle .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , so that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who@@ ever there is among you of all his people , may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ( he is God ) , which is in Jer@@ usalem .
now these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ nine .
of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
then J@@ es@@ hua stood with his sons and his brothers , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to have the over@@ sight of the work@@ men in God 's house : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and heads of fa@@ thers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice . many also sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy ,
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people ; for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard far away .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble Os@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the city of Samar@@ ia , and in the rest of the country beyond the River , and so forth , wrote .
the gold and silver vessels also of God 's house , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those Cy@@ ru@@ s the king took out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered to one whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , who are min@@ ded of their own free will to go to Jer@@ usalem , go with you .
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
who@@ ever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all dil@@ ig@@ ence , whether it be to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fa@@ thers , who has put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem ;
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , who were teachers .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors , and his pr@@ inces , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch , and keep them , until you we@@ igh them before the chiefs of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the rooms of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves and for their sons , so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers has been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass . "
the children of the cap@@ tivity did so . E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , with certain heads of fa@@ thers ' households , after their fa@@ thers ' houses , and all of them by their names , were set apart ; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
that Han@@ ani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
but if you return to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and do them , though your out@@ casts were in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ ens , yet will I gather them from there , and will bring them to the place that I have chosen , to cause my name to d@@ well there . '
it happened in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jer@@ usalem ; neither was there any animal with me , except the animal that I ro@@ de on .
the rul@@ ers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest who did the work .
next to them , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ ah , the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z made repairs . next to them , Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ el made repairs . next to them , Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana made repairs .
after him , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Beth Z@@ ur , made repairs to the place opposite the tom@@ bs of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty men .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer that stands out from the up@@ per house of the king , which is by the court of the guard . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h made repairs .
it happened from that time forth , that half of my servants worked in the work , and half of them held the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the co@@ ats of mail ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
you have also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of you at Jer@@ usalem , saying , ' There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together . "
these are the children of the province , who went up out of the cap@@ tivity of those who had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and who returned to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , everyone to his city ;
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , and all Israel , lived in their cities . when the seventh month had come , the children of Israel were in their cities .
on the second day were gathered together the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to give attention to the words of the law .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , everyone on the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
all the assembly of those who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and lived in the bo@@ o@@ ths ; for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so . there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
and showed signs and won@@ ders against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and against all his servants , and against all the people of his land ; for you knew that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them , and made a name for yo@@ ur@@ self , as it is this day .
and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger , and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and comman@@ ded them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which you had sworn to give them .
for they have not served you in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in your great Go@@ od@@ ness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ born of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , to the pri@@ ests who minister in the house of our God ;
the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
in Jer@@ usalem lived certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;
these are the sons of Benjamin : Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ha@@ i@@ ah .
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah ,
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets : Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h ;
and above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and by the old gate , and by the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Ham@@ me@@ ah , even to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the gate of the guard .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ abi@@ te should not enter into the assembly of God fore@@ ver ,
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Wh@@ y do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on the Sab@@ b@@ ath .
I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and struck certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , " You shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both great and small , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace .
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een will become known to all women , causing them to show con@@ temp@@ t for their hus@@ bands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come . '
if it ple@@ ases the king , let it be written that they be destroyed ; and I will pay ten thousand tal@@ ents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king 's business , to bring it into the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies . "
now it happened on the third day that Es@@ ther put on her royal clo@@ thing , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , next to the king 's house . the king sat on his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , next to the entrance of the house .
when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , she obtained fav@@ or in his sight ; and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ ter that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther came near , and touched the top of the scep@@ ter .
they killed Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , Dal@@ ph@@ on , A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
therefore the Jews of the villages , who live in the un@@ wal@@ led towns , make the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gla@@ d@@ ness and fe@@ asting , a good day , and a day of sending presents of food to one another .
because Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a , the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plot@@ ted against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast " PUR , " that is the lot , to consum@@ e them , and to destroy them ;
but when this became known to the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he had dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return on his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to which the king advanced him , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize him , they raised their voices , and we@@ pt ; and they each t@@ ore his ro@@ be , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust on their heads toward the sky .
it was so , that after Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken these words to Jo@@ b , Yah@@ we@@ h said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , " My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b has .

who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet he will have rule over all of my la@@ bor in which I have la@@ bo@@ red , and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun . this also is van@@ ity .
then I returned and saw all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold , the te@@ ars of those who were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
there is a van@@ ity which is done on the ear@@ th , that there are righ@@ te@@ ous men to whom it happens according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked . again , there are w@@ ic@@ ked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous . I said that this also is van@@ ity .
for man also do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know his time . as the fish that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are , even so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it falls su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them .
D@@ on '@@ t cur@@ se the king , no , not in your th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and don '@@ t cur@@ se the rich in your bed@@ room : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has w@@ ings may tell the matter .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the ear@@ th ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .

in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the street ; when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of music shall be brought low ;

when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from its mid@@ st , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
now I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard . I will take away its h@@ edge , and it will be e@@ aten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tr@@ amp@@ led down .
it happened in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up to Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is al@@ lied with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . " his heart tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest tre@@ m@@ ble with the wind .
in that day the Lord will s@@ have with a ra@@ zor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head and the ha@@ ir of the feet ; and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
and it shall happen , that because of the ab@@ und@@ ance of milk which they shall give he shall eat but@@ ter : for everyone will eat but@@ ter and hon@@ ey that is left in the mid@@ st of the land .
they will pass through it , very dist@@ ressed and hun@@ gry ; and it will happen that when they are hun@@ gry , they will worry , and cur@@ se by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces up@@ ward ,
one will dev@@ our on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
should an ax@@ e bra@@ g against him who ch@@ ops with it ? should a saw ex@@ alt itself above him who sa@@ ws with it ? as if a ro@@ d should lift those who lift it up , or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood .
it will come to pass in that day that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will no more again le@@ an on him who struck them , but shall le@@ an on Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness he will judge the poor , and decide with equ@@ ity for the hum@@ ble of the ear@@ th . he will strike the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh ; and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps he will kill the w@@ ic@@ ked .
they will fly down on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines on the west . together they will pl@@ under the children of the east . they will extend their power over E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon will obe@@ y them .
for the stars of the sky and its con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations will not give their light . the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to sh@@ ine .
it will happen in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sor@@ row , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
for before the har@@ v@@ est , when the b@@ los@@ so@@ m is over , and the f@@ lower becomes a ri@@ pen@@ ing gra@@ pe , he will cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
therefore my th@@ igh@@ s are filled with an@@ gu@@ ish . pain@@ s have taken hold on me , like the pain@@ s of a woman in la@@ bor . I am in so much p@@ ain that I can '@@ t hear . I so am dis@@ may@@ ed that I can '@@ t see .
and I will clo@@ the him with your ro@@ be , and strengthen him with your bel@@ t . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
it will happen after the end of sev@@ enty years that Yah@@ we@@ h will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
it will happen that he who fle@@ es from the no@@ ise of the fear will fall into the p@@ it ; and he who comes up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it will be taken in the sn@@ are ; for the windows on high are opened , and the foundations of the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ ble .
for he has brought down those who d@@ well on high , the lo@@ f@@ ty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the d@@ ust .
when its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are with@@ ered , they will be broken off . the women will come and set them on fire , for they are a people of no understanding . therefore he who made them will not have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and he who formed them will show them no fav@@ or .
you will be brought down , and will speak out of the ground . your speech will m@@ um@@ ble out of the d@@ ust . your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and your speech will wh@@ is@@ per out of the d@@ ust .
but when he sees his children , the work of my hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name . yes , they will sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and will stand in a@@ we of the God of Israel .
he will break it as a P@@ ot@@ ter 's ves@@ sel is broken , breaking it in pieces without spar@@ ing , so that there won '@@ t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the Hear@@ th , or to dip up water out of the c@@ ister@@ n . "
Wo@@ e to those who go down to Egypt for help , and rely on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots because they are many , and in hor@@ se@@ men because they are very strong , but they don '@@ t look to the Holy One of Israel , and they don '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h !
the wild animals of the de@@ sert will meet with the w@@ ol@@ ves , and the wild go@@ at will cry to his fellow . yes , the night cre@@ ature shall settle there , and shall find her@@ self a place of rest .
" thus you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , " Jer@@ usalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
because of your ra@@ ging against me , and because your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance has come up into my e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in your n@@ ose and my bri@@ dle in your li@@ ps , and I will turn you back by the way by which you came .
be@@ hold , I will cause the shadow on the sun@@ di@@ al , which has gone down on the sun@@ di@@ al of A@@ haz with the sun , to return back@@ ward ten steps . so the sun returned ten steps on the sun@@ di@@ al on which it had gone down . " ' "
my d@@ wel@@ ling is removed , and is carried away from me like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent . I have rol@@ led up , like a we@@ av@@ er , my life . he will cut me off from the lo@@ om . from day even to night you will make an end of me .
who has meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and marked off the sky with his sp@@ an , and calculated the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
you will seek them , and won '@@ t find them , even those who conten@@ d with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @@@ -@@ @ ex@@ istent thing .
who has declared it from the beginning , that we may know ? and before , that we may say , ' He is right ? ' su@@ rely , there is no one who declar@@ es . su@@ rely , there is no one who shows . su@@ rely , there is no one who he@@ ars your words .
thus says God Yah@@ we@@ h , he who created the heav@@ ens and stret@@ ched them out , he who spread out the ear@@ th and that which comes out of it , he who gives bre@@ ath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will go out like a m@@ igh@@ ty man . he will stir up z@@ e@@ al like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will sh@@ out al@@ oud . he will triumph over his enem@@ ies .
therefore he p@@ oured the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger on him , and the strength of battle ; and it set him on fire all around , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; and it burned him , but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take it to heart . "
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and fla@@ me will not scor@@ ch you .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel : " for your sake , I have sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring all of them down as fugitives , even the Chal@@ de@@ ans , in the ships of their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
the car@@ pen@@ ter stret@@ ches out a line . he marks it out with a pen@@ cil . he shap@@ es it with planes . he marks it out with comp@@ ass@@ es , and shap@@ es it like the figure of a man , with the beauty of a man , to resi@@ de in a house .
they bear it on the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry it , and set it in its place , and it stands , from its place it shall not move : yes , one may cry to it , yet it can not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
" stand now with your en@@ chan@@ tments , and with the multi@@ tude of your sor@@ cer@@ ies , in which you have la@@ bo@@ red from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prev@@ ail .
" hear this , house of Jac@@ o@@ b , you who are called by the name of Israel , and have come forth out of the waters of Ju@@ da@@ h ; who swe@@ ar by the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness
therefore I have declared it to you from of old ; before it came to pass I showed it to you ; lest you should say , ' My i@@ dol has done them , and my en@@ gra@@ ved image , and my m@@ ol@@ ten image , has comman@@ ded them . '
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " be@@ hold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , and set up my ban@@ ner to the peoples ; and they shall bring your sons in their bos@@ om , and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be carried on their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " W@@ here is the bill of your mother 's div@@ or@@ ce , with which I have put her away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? be@@ hold , for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities were you sold , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions was your mother put away .
the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h has given me the ton@@ gue of those who are ta@@ ught , that I may know how to sustain with words him who is we@@ ary : he w@@ ak@@ ens morning by morning , he w@@ ak@@ ens my e@@ ar to hear as those who are ta@@ ught .
for Yah@@ we@@ h has comfor@@ ted Z@@ ion ; he has comfor@@ ted all her waste places , and has made her w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like E@@ den , and her de@@ sert like the gar@@ den of Yah@@ we@@ h ; joy and gla@@ d@@ ness shall be found there@@ in , Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of me@@ lo@@ dy .
thus says your Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , and your God who p@@ leads the cause of his people , " be@@ hold , I have taken out of your hand the c@@ up of stag@@ gering , even the bo@@ w@@ l of the c@@ up of my wr@@ ath ; you shall no more drink it again :
and I will put it into the hand of those who aff@@ lic@@ t you , who have said to your sou@@ l , ' bo@@ w down , that we may walk over you ; ' and you have laid your back as the ground , and as the street , to those who walk over . "
he was op@@ pressed , yet when he was aff@@ lic@@ ted he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh . as a lam@@ b that is led to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep that before its s@@ hear@@ ers is m@@ ute , so he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh .
" D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you shall not be as@@ ha@@ med : neither be con@@ founded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the sh@@ ame of your youth ; and the re@@ pro@@ ach of your wi@@ do@@ who@@ od you shall remember no more .
why do you spend money for that which is not bread ? and your la@@ bor for that which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t satisfy ? listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to me , and eat you that which is good , and let your sou@@ l de@@ light itself in fat@@ ness .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t return there , but waters the ear@@ th , and makes it bring forth and bu@@ d , and gives se@@ ed to the so@@ wer and bread to the e@@ ater ;
so shall my word be that goes forth out of my m@@ outh : it shall not return to me vo@@ id , but it shall accomp@@ lish that which I ple@@ ase , and it shall prosp@@ er in the thing I sent it to do .
even them will I bring to my hol@@ y mountain , and make them jo@@ y@@ ful in my house of pray@@ er : their bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be accepted on my alt@@ ar ; for my house shall be called a house of pray@@ er for all peoples . "
for thus says the high and lo@@ f@@ ty One who inhabi@@ ts et@@ ern@@ ity , whose name is Holy : " I d@@ well in the high and hol@@ y place , with him also who is of a contr@@ ite and hum@@ ble spirit , to revive the spirit of the hum@@ ble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite .
'@@ Wh@@ y have we fas@@ ted , ' say they , ' and you don '@@ t see ? why have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and you take no knowledge ? ' " be@@ hold , in the day of your fast you find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ b@@ ors .
Is@@ n '@@ t it to distri@@ bute your bread to the hun@@ gry , and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house ? when you see the nak@@ ed , that you cover him ; and that you not hide yo@@ ur@@ self from your own f@@ les@@ h ?
" as for me , this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .

the sons of those who aff@@ lic@@ ted you shall come ben@@ ding to you ; and all those who desp@@ ised you shall bo@@ w themselves down at the so@@ les of your feet ; and they shall call you The city of Yah@@ we@@ h , The Z@@ ion of the Holy One of Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " su@@ rely I will no more give your gra@@ in to be food for your enem@@ ies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have la@@ bo@@ red :
" I have tro@@ dden the win@@ e@@ press alone ; and of the peoples there was no man with me : yes , I tro@@ d them in my an@@ ger , and tr@@ amp@@ led them in my wr@@ ath ; and their li@@ fe@@ blood is sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on my gar@@ ments , and I have st@@ ained all my clo@@ thing .
I will make mention of the lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses of Yah@@ we@@ h and the pra@@ ises of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h has bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he has bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ nesses .
" I am inqu@@ ired of by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , Se@@ e me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I also will choose their de@@ lu@@ sions , and will bring their fears on them ; because when I called , no one answ@@ ered ; when I spoke , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ; but they did that which was ev@@ il in my eyes , and chose that in which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ light . "
for , be@@ hold , I will call all the families of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the north , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his th@@ r@@ one at the entrance of the gates of Jer@@ usalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I saw , when , for this very cause that back@@ sli@@ ding Israel had committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , I had put her away and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce , yet t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous Ju@@ da@@ h , her sister , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear ; but she also went and played the pro@@ stitute .
my an@@ gu@@ ish , my an@@ gu@@ ish ! I am pain@@ ed at my very heart ; my heart is dis@@ qu@@ i@@ eted in me ; I can '@@ t hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my sou@@ l , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , the alarm of war .
I will go to the great men , and will speak to them ; for they know the way of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the law of their God . " but these with one accord have broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
they shall eat up your har@@ v@@ est , and your bread , which your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat . they shall eat up your f@@ loc@@ ks and your her@@ ds . they shall eat up your v@@ ines and your fi@@ g trees . they shall beat down your for@@ ti@@ fied cities , in which you trust , with the s@@ word .
they have grown f@@ at . they sh@@ ine ; yes , they exc@@ ell in de@@ eds of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . they don '@@ t p@@ lead the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , that they may prosp@@ er ; and they don '@@ t judge the right of the ne@@ edy .
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can '@@ t listen . be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has become a re@@ pro@@ ach to them . they have no de@@ light in it .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer :
the children gather wood , and the fa@@ thers kin@@ dle the fire , and the women k@@ ne@@ ad the d@@ ough , to make cak@@ es to the qu@@ een of the sky , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds , that they may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day , I have sent to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de ; for the land shall become a waste .
at that time , says Yah@@ we@@ h , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves ;
they are like a pal@@ m tree , of turned work , and don '@@ t speak : they must be carried , because they can '@@ t go . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of them ; for they can '@@ t do ev@@ il , neither is it in them to do good . "
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the arti@@ fic@@ er and of the hands of the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h ; blue and pur@@ ple for their clo@@ thing ; they are all the work of s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful men .
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ nings for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
p@@ our out your wr@@ ath on the nations that don '@@ t know you , and on the families that don '@@ t call on your name : for they have dev@@ oured Jac@@ o@@ b , yes , they have dev@@ oured him and consu@@ med him , and have laid waste his habi@@ tation .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h against all my ev@@ il neigh@@ b@@ ors , who touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it : be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them up from off their land , and will p@@ lu@@ ck up the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
it shall happen , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them up , I will return and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
give gl@@ ory to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , before he causes d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble on the dark mountains , and , while you look for light , he turns it into the shadow of death , and makes it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
why should you be like a scar@@ ed man , as a m@@ igh@@ ty man who can '@@ t save ? yet you , Yah@@ we@@ h , are in the mid@@ st of us , and we are called by your name ; don '@@ t leave us .
the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them@@ -@@ -@@ them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess on them .
I will cause them to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who b@@ ore them , and concerning their fa@@ thers who became their father in this land :
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel : be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place , before your eyes and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de .
you , even of yo@@ ur@@ self , shall dis@@ continue from your heritage that I gave you ; and I will cause you to serve your enem@@ ies in the land which you don '@@ t know : for you have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in my an@@ ger which shall bur@@ n fore@@ ver .
it shall happen , if you dil@@ ig@@ ently listen to me , says Yah@@ we@@ h , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , but to make the Sab@@ b@@ ath day hol@@ y , to do no work there@@ in ;
they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places around Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the low@@ land , and from the hill country , and from the South , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and me@@ al offer@@ ings , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and give them over to the power of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves become ch@@ ild@@ less , and wi@@ dows ; and let their men be sla@@ in of death , and their young men struck of the s@@ word in battle .
I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hand of those who seek their life : and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the ear@@ th .
I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and they shall eat everyone the f@@ les@@ h of his friend , in the siege and in the dist@@ ress , with which their enem@@ ies , and those who seek their life , shall dist@@ ress them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which are def@@ iled , shall be as the place of Top@@ het@@ h , even all the houses on whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se to all the army of the sky , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings to other go@@ ds .
moreover I will give all the ri@@ ches of this city , and all its gains , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall make them a pre@@ y , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes out , and passes over to the Chal@@ de@@ ans who bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y .
and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life , and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to this day , these twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h has come to me , and I have spoken to you , rising up early and speaking ; but you have not list@@ ened .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the lam@@ p .
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
a no@@ ise shall come even to the end of the ear@@ th ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a controversy with the nations ; he will enter into judgment with all f@@ les@@ h : as for the w@@ ic@@ ked , he will give them to the s@@ word , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the sla@@ in of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung on the sur@@ face of the ground .
it happened , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him to speak to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall su@@ rely die .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when U@@ ri@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , and to the king of T@@ y@@ re , and to the king of S@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers who come to Jer@@ usalem to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
but as for you , don '@@ t you listen to your pro@@ ph@@ ets , nor to your di@@ vin@@ ers , nor to your dre@@ ams , nor to your so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , nor to your sor@@ cer@@ ers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ z@@ ur , the pro@@ phe@@ t , who was of Gi@@ be@@ on , spoke to me in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
Yah@@ we@@ h has made you pri@@ est in the place of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that there may be officers in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , for every man who is ma@@ d , and makes himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that you should put him in the sto@@ cks and in sh@@ ack@@ les .
all your lov@@ ers have forgotten you ; they don '@@ t seek you : for I have wounded you with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because your sin@@ s were increased .
therefore all those who dev@@ our you shall be dev@@ oured ; and all your ad@@ vers@@ aries , everyone of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and those who desp@@ oil you shall be a sp@@ oil , and all who pre@@ y on you will I give for a pre@@ y .
out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of those who make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
their pr@@ ince shall be of themselves , and their ru@@ ler shall proceed from their mid@@ st ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had bol@@ d@@ ness to approach to me ? says Yah@@ we@@ h .
they shall come with we@@ eping ; and with peti@@ tions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a stra@@ ight way in which they shall not st@@ um@@ ble ; for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they broke , although I was a husband to them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my an@@ ger , and in my wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they may not de@@ part from me .
I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the low@@ land , and in the cities of the South , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th that were under his domin@@ ion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
at the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , who has been sold to you , and has served you six years , you shall let him go free from you : but your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but you turned and prof@@ an@@ ed my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom you had let go free at their pleas@@ ure , to return ; and you brought them into subj@@ ection , to be to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life ; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , who have gone away from you .
but it happened , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans ; so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
take a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even to this day .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah ; and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book .
therefore you go , and read in the s@@ cr@@ oll , which you have written from my m@@ outh , the words of Yah@@ we@@ h in the e@@ ars of the people in Yah@@ we@@ h 's house on the fast day ; and also you shall read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h who come out of their cities .
now it happened in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and all the people who came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h to Jer@@ usalem , proclaimed a fast before Yah@@ we@@ h .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the room of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , the s@@ cri@@ be , in the up@@ per court , at the entry of the new gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's room : and be@@ hold , all the pr@@ inces were sitting there , E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the s@@ cr@@ oll in the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be ; and they told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to get the s@@ cr@@ oll ; and he took it out of the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be . J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces who stood bes@@ ide the king .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ udi had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the pen@@ k@@ ni@@ fe , and cast it into the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier , until all the s@@ cr@@ oll was consu@@ med in the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h : he shall have none to sit on the th@@ r@@ one of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , He who remains in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; but he who goes forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a pre@@ y , and he shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah san@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed@@ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , a e@@ un@@ u@@ ch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is likely to die in the place where he is , because of the fam@@ ine ; for there is no more bread in the city .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
they shall bring out all your wi@@ ves and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
it happened that , when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and all the men of war saw them , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Ara@@ bah .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the resi@@ due of the people who remained in the city , the de@@ ser@@ ters also who fell away to him , and the resi@@ due of the people who remained .
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all the cap@@ tives of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , who were carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed to him men , and women , and children , and of the poorest of the land , of those who were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , to stand before the Chal@@ de@@ ans who shall come to us : but you , gather wine and summer fru@@ its and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that you have taken .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the children of Am@@ mon , and in E@@ dom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they ate bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and killed him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah killed them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men who were with him .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up ; for I gri@@ eve over the dist@@ ress that I have brought on you .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
then it shall happen , that the s@@ word , which you fear , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt ; and the fam@@ ine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
so shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there : they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring on them .
for you have dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully against your own so@@ ul@@ s ; for you sent me to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , saying , pra@@ y for us to Yah@@ we@@ h our God ; and according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall say , so declare to us , and we will do it :
it happened that , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Yah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at Mem@@ p@@ his , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
have you forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves which they committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
so that Yah@@ we@@ h could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which you have committed ; therefore your land has become a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without inhabi@@ tant , as it is this day .
be@@ hold , I watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good ; and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h who are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t spoke to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he wrote these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
he made many to st@@ um@@ ble , yes , they fell one on another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our birth , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men in the mid@@ st of her are like cal@@ ves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand : for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity has come on them , the time of their vis@@ itation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but don '@@ t you be afraid , Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed , Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save you from af@@ ar , and your se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and shall be quiet and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong ones , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers don '@@ t look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
he who fle@@ es from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he who gets up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring on him , even on Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon ; for a fire is gone forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and has dev@@ oured the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
be@@ hold , I will bring a fear on you , says the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , from all who are around you ; and you shall be driven out every man right forth , and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
their ca@@ me@@ ls shall be a bo@@ o@@ ty , and the multi@@ tude of their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck a sp@@ oil : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter to all winds those who have the cor@@ ners of their be@@ ards cut off ; and I will bring their cal@@ am@@ ity from every side of them , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him who hand@@ les the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
a s@@ word is on their hor@@ ses , and on their char@@ i@@ ots , and on all the mixed people who are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is on her treasures , and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
they lay hold on bo@@ w and spe@@ ar ; they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy ; their voice ro@@ ars like the sea ; and they ride on hor@@ ses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he has taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he has pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely they shall dra@@ g them away , even the little ones of the flock ; su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late over them .
against him who ben@@ ds let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him who lif@@ ts himself up in his co@@ at of mail : and don '@@ t spar@@ e her young men ; ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all her army .
when he ut@@ ters his voice , there is a t@@ um@@ ult of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he causes the v@@ ap@@ ors to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he makes ligh@@ t@@ ning for the rain , and brings forth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .
and with you will I break in pieces the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with you will I break in pieces the far@@ mer and his yok@@ e ; and with you will I break in pieces govern@@ ors and deputies .
I will exec@@ ute judgment on B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he has sw@@ allowed up ; and the nations shall not flow any more to him : yes , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
it shall be , when you have made an end of reading this book , that you shall bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and en@@ camp@@ ed against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem :
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the poorest of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their br@@ ass to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the captain of the guard took away the c@@ ups , the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , the po@@ ts , the lam@@ p@@ stands , the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the bo@@ w@@ ls ; that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
and for his allow@@ ance , there was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him by the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand ; They are k@@ n@@ it together , they have come up on my nec@@ k ; he has made my strength to fail : the Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger ! he has cast down from heav@@ en to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , An@@ d has@@ n '@@ t remember@@ ed his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger .
the Lord has sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has thrown down in his wr@@ ath the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He has brought them down to the ground ; he has prof@@ an@@ ed the k@@ ing@@ dom and its pr@@ inces .
the Lord has cast off his alt@@ ar , he has ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces : they have made a no@@ ise in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n assembly .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit on the ground , they keep sil@@ ence ; They have cast up d@@ ust on their heads ; they have clo@@ th@@ ed themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
my eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my heart is troubled ; My li@@ ver is p@@ oured on the ear@@ th , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , Bec@@ ause the young children and the inf@@ ants s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h has done that which he pur@@ posed ; he has fulfilled his word that he comman@@ ded in the days of old ; He has thrown down , and has not p@@ iti@@ ed : he has caused the enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over you ; he has ex@@ al@@ ted the Hor@@ n of your ad@@ vers@@ aries .
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the wat@@ ches ; p@@ our out your heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , that fa@@ int for hunger at the head of every street .
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word : you have killed them in the day of your an@@ ger ; you have sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , like the appearance of tor@@ ches : the fire went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
I saw as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal , as the appearance of fire within it all around , from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward ; and from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and there was bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness around him .
and I will make your ton@@ gue stick to the ro@@ of of your m@@ outh , that you shall be m@@ ute , and shall not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
she has rebel@@ led against my ord@@ inan@@ ces in doing w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and against my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and as for my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you are turbul@@ ent more than the nations that are around you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my ord@@ inan@@ ces , neither have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you ;
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of you , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you ; and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ at@@ ter to all the winds .
therefore as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely , because you have def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all your de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all your ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish you ; neither shall my eye spar@@ e , and I also will have no p@@ ity .
and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to the mountains and to the hil@@ ls , to the water@@ courses and to the val@@ ley@@ s : be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word on you , and I will destroy your high places .
he who is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he who is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he who remains and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my wr@@ ath on them .
my eye shall not spar@@ e you , neither will I have p@@ ity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of you ; and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , do strike .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h fell there on me .
then I saw , and be@@ hold , a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his wa@@ ist and down@@ ward , fire ; and from his wa@@ ist and up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as it were g@@ low@@ ing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , nor@@ th@@ ward of the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
he brought me into the in@@ ner court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and see , at the door of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five men , with their backs toward Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and their faces toward the east ; and they were wor@@ shipping the sun toward the east .
the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark on the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry over all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that are done in its mid@@ st .
then I looked , and see , in the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m there appeared above them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h moun@@ ted up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , who took it and went out .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes all around , even the whe@@ els that the four of them had .
the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight when they went forth , and the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them : and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
in their sight you shall bear it on your sho@@ ul@@ der , and carry it forth in the dark ; you shall cover your face , so that you don '@@ t see the land : for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel .
I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for removing , and in the even I du@@ g through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , and b@@ ore it on my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are ; and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
so will I break down the wall that you have plas@@ tered with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consu@@ med in its mid@@ st : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have gri@@ ev@@ ed the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , and be sav@@ ed alive :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , for a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has dev@@ oured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
as for your birth , in the day you were born your nav@@ el was not cut , neither were you was@@ hed in water to cleans@@ e you ; you w@@ eren '@@ t sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
no eye p@@ iti@@ ed you , to do any of these things to you , to have comp@@ as@@ sion on you ; but you were cast out in the open field , for that your person was ab@@ hor@@ red , in the day that you were born .
you took of your gar@@ ments , and made for yo@@ ur@@ selves high places dec@@ ked with various col@@ ors , and played the pro@@ stitute on them : [ the like things ] shall not come , neither shall it be [ so ] .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your va@@ ulted place , and break down your lo@@ f@@ ty places ; and they shall stri@@ p you of your clo@@ th@@ es , and take your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s ; and they shall leave you nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
they shall bur@@ n your houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to ce@@ ase from playing the pro@@ stitute , and you shall also give no h@@ ire any more .
you are the daughter of your mother , who lo@@ ath@@ es her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your s@@ ist@@ ers , who lo@@ ath@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was a H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
your el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your left hand , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
your s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate ; and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate ; and you and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will enter into judgment with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he has t@@ res@@ passed against me .
in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and bear fruit , and be a good@@ ly c@@ ed@@ ar : and under it shall d@@ well all birds of every wing ; in the sha@@ de of its branches shall they d@@ well .
and has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither has def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day when I chose Israel , and s@@ wor@@ e to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I s@@ wor@@ e to them , saying , I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God ;
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out ;
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and those who dis@@ obe@@ y against me ; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
for in my hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them , serve me in the land : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the first fru@@ its of your offer@@ ings , with all your hol@@ y things .
as a pleas@@ ant ar@@ om@@ a will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been sc@@ at@@ tered ; and I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in you in the sight of the nations .
it is given to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : the s@@ word , it is shar@@ pen@@ ed , yes , it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the kil@@ ler .
also , you son of man , appoint two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come ; they both shall come forth out of one land : and mark out a place , mark it out at the head of the way to the city .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ gin@@ ity ; and they p@@ oured out their prostitution on her .
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery ; and they have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ ore to me , to pass through [ the fire ] to them to be dev@@ oured .
take the choice of the flock , and also a p@@ ile [ of wood ] for the b@@ ones under [ the cal@@ dr@@ on ] ; make it bo@@ il well ; yes , let its b@@ ones be bo@@ iled in its mid@@ st .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their en@@ camp@@ ments in you , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
to the children of the east , [ to go ] against the children of Am@@ mon ; and I will give them for a possession , that the children of Am@@ mon may not be remember@@ ed among the nations .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the s@@ word ; and the pil@@ lars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
they shall make a sp@@ oil of your ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleas@@ ant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your tim@@ ber and your d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the waters .
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay aside their rob@@ es , and stri@@ p off their em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit on the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at you .
all who handled the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , [ and ] all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
you were the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b who covers : and I set you , [ so that ] you were on the hol@@ y mountain of God ; you have walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they d@@ well in their own land which I gave to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
I will put ho@@ oks in your j@@ a@@ ws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scal@@ es ; and I will bring you up out of the mid@@ st of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scal@@ es .
I 'll cast you forth into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , you and all the fish of your rivers . you 'll fall on the open field . you won '@@ t be brought together , nor gathered . I have given you for food to the animals of the ear@@ th and to the birds of the sky .
I will make the land of Egypt a de@@ so@@ lation in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late ; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a de@@ so@@ lation for@@ ty years ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries . "
and I will bring back the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will give the land of Egypt to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and he shall carry off her multi@@ tude , and take her sp@@ oil , and take her pre@@ y ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and will sell the land into the hand of ev@@ il men ; and I will make the land de@@ so@@ late , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause the images to ce@@ ase from Mem@@ p@@ his ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince from the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall withdraw itself , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt , and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and be@@ hold , it has not been bound up , to apply [ he@@ aling ] medicin@@ es , to put a ban@@ da@@ ge to bin@@ d it , that it be strong to hold the s@@ word .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the s@@ word to fall out of his hand .
S@@ tran@@ gers , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : on the mountains and in all the val@@ ley@@ s his branches are fallen , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s are broken by all the water@@ courses of the land ; and all the peoples of the ear@@ th are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
they also went down into She@@ ol with him to those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the nations .
I will leave you on the land , I will cast you forth on the open field , and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you , and I will satisfy the animals of the whole ear@@ th with you .
son of man , speak to the children of your people , and tell them , When I bring the s@@ word on a land , and the people of the land take a man from among them , and set him for their watch@@ man ;
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth [ month ] , in the fifth [ day ] of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jer@@ usalem came to me , saying , The city has been struck .
you ha@@ ven '@@ t strengthened the dis@@ eased , neither have you he@@ aled that which was si@@ ck , neither have you bound up that which was broken , neither have you brought back that which was driven away , neither have you sought that which was lost ; but with force and with ri@@ gor you have ruled over them .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , su@@ rely because my she@@ ep became a pre@@ y , and my she@@ ep became food to all the animals of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my she@@ ep , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fe@@ ed my she@@ ep ;
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will fe@@ ed them on the mountains of Israel , by the water@@ courses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will seek that which was lost , and will bring back that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but the f@@ at and the strong I will destroy ; I will fe@@ ed them in justice .
does it seem a small thing to you to have f@@ ed on the good pas@@ ture , but you must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ ture ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the clear waters , but you must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me out in the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley ; and it was full of b@@ ones .
say to them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all ;
they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , in which your fa@@ thers lived ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , they , and their children , and their children 's children , fore@@ ver : and David my ser@@ vant shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hor@@ des , and on the many peoples who are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and sul@@ f@@ ur .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
you shall fall on the mountains of Israel , you , and all your hor@@ des , and the peoples who are with you : I will give you to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the animals of the field to be dev@@ oured .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall make fires of the weapons ; and they shall pl@@ under those who pl@@ under@@ ed them , and ro@@ b those who ro@@ bbed them , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into cap@@ tivity for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because they t@@ res@@ passed against me , and I hi@@ d my face from them : so I gave them into the hand of their ad@@ vers@@ aries , and they fell all of them by the s@@ word .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , in that I caused them to go into cap@@ tivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me there .
he brought me there ; and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one Re@@ ed broad .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cu@@ bit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cu@@ bit on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
the windows of it , and its ar@@ ches , and the pal@@ m trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its ar@@ ches were before them .
on the [ one ] side outside , as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side , which belonged to the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts all around .
the th@@ res@@ holds , and the closed windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies around on their three stories , over against the threshold , with wood ce@@ il@@ ings all around , and [ from ] the ground up to the windows , ( now the windows were covered ) ,
so that there was the face of a man toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side . [ thus was it ] made through all the house all around :
the doors had two leaves [ ap@@ i@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
in their setting of their threshold by my threshold , and their do@@ or@@ post bes@@ ide my do@@ or@@ post , and there was [ but ] the wall between me and them ; and they have def@@ iled my hol@@ y name by their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed : therefore I have consu@@ med them in my an@@ ger .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four hor@@ ns of it , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall cleans@@ e it and make At@@ on@@ ement for it .
in that you have brought in foreigners , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to prof@@ ane it , even my house , when you offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , [ to add ] to all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
they shall not come near to me , to exec@@ ute the office of pri@@ est to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , to the things that are most hol@@ y ; but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
it shall be that , when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come on them , while they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
the first of all the first fru@@ its of every thing , and every offering of everything , of all your offer@@ ings , shall be for the pri@@ est : you shall also give to the pri@@ ests the first of your d@@ ough , to cause a b@@ les@@ sing to rest on your house .
moreover , when you shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , you shall offer an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , a hol@@ y portion of the land ; the length shall be the length of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand [ re@@ eds ] , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand : it shall be hol@@ y in all its border all around .
it is a hol@@ y portion of the land ; it shall be for the pri@@ ests , the ministers of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , who come near to minister to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and it shall be a place for their houses , and a hol@@ y place for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it on the door posts of the house , and on the four cor@@ ners of the ledge of the alt@@ ar , and on the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the me@@ al offering , and according to the oil .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y rooms for the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and be@@ hold , there was a place on the hin@@ der part w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me out by the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me round by the way outside to the ou@@ ter gate , by the way of [ the gate ] that looks toward the east ; and be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the k@@ ne@@ es . again he meas@@ ured one thousand , and caused me to pass through [ the waters ] , waters that were to the wa@@ ist .
it shall happen , that fisher@@ men shall stand by it : from En Ge@@ di even to En Eg@@ la@@ im shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
these shall be its measures : the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
the city shall have subur@@ bs : toward the north two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred fif@@ ty .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the pr@@ ince .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one ; the gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un , one .
the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d : and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties , and of the wine which he d@@ rank , and that they should be no@@ ur@@ ished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names to them : to Daniel he gave [ the name of ] Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , [ of ] Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , [ of ] Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go .
and wher@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
the leaves of it were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all : the animals of the field had shadow under it , and the birds of the sky lived in its branches , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed from it .
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of its roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of the sky : and let his portion be with the animals in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the k@@ ing@@ dom has depar@@ ted from you :
in the same hour came forth the fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lam@@ p@@ stand on the plas@@ ter of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
now the wise men , the en@@ chan@@ ters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpre@@ tation ; but they could not show the interpre@@ tation of the thing .
and because of the gre@@ at@@ ness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and fear@@ ed before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
then was the king exceeding glad , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had tr@@ usted in his God .
I make a decree , that in all the domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and stead@@ fast fore@@ ver , H@@ is k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed ; and his domin@@ ion shall be even to the end .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
through his policy he shall cause craft to prosp@@ er in his hand ; and he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself in his heart , and in [ their ] security shall he destroy many : he shall also stand up against the pr@@ ince of pr@@ inces ; but he shall be broken without hand .
my God , turn your e@@ ar , and hear ; open your eyes , and see our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by your name : for we do not present our peti@@ tions before you for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but for your great mer@@ cies ' sake .
yes , while I was speaking in pray@@ er , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sle@@ ep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but out of a sho@@ ot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail .
the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multi@@ tude greater than the former ; and he shall come on at the end of the times , [ even of ] years , with a great army and with much sub@@ stance .
for ships of Kit@@ tim shall come against him ; therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and shall return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] : he shall even return , and have regard to those who for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the fortress , and shall take away the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and they shall set up the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many [ countries ] shall be over@@ thrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Hos@@ ea the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it will come to pass that , in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' they will be called ' sons of the living God . '
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and make her b@@ are as in the day that she was born , and make her like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and kill her with thir@@ st .
I will give her v@@ ine@@ yards from there , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will so@@ w her to me in the ear@@ th ; and I will have mer@@ cy on her who had not obtained mer@@ cy ; and I will tell those who were not my people , ' You are my people ; ' and they will say , ' My God ! ' "
therefore the land will mour@@ n , and everyone who d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in will waste aw@@ ay@@ . all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
for I will be to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im like a lion , and like a young lion to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . I myself will tear in pieces and go away . I will carry off , and there will be no one to deliver .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made pr@@ inces , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yok@@ e on their nec@@ ks ; and I b@@ ent down to him and I f@@ ed him .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and like the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the v@@ ine has dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree with@@ ered ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all of the trees of the field are with@@ ered ; for joy has with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; and I will exec@@ ute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
it will happen in that day , that the mountains will drop down swe@@ et wine , the hil@@ ls will flow with milk , all the bro@@ oks of Ju@@ da@@ h will flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain will come forth from the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have rejected Yah@@ we@@ h 's law , and have not kept his stat@@ utes , and their lies have led them as@@ tra@@ y , after which their fa@@ thers walked ;
" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
seek him who made the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades and Ori@@ on , and turns the shadow of death into the morning , and makes the day dark with night ; who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , Yah@@ we@@ h is his name ,
For@@ as@@ much therefore as you tr@@ amp@@ le on the poor , and take taxes from him of wheat : you have built houses of cut stone , but you will not d@@ well in them . you have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but you shall not drink their wine .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the Lord : " w@@ ailing will be in all the broad ways ; and they will say in all the streets , ' A@@ las ! A@@ las ! ' and they will call the far@@ mer to mourning , and those who are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in lament@@ ation to w@@ ailing .
though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and it will bi@@ te them .
it is he who buil@@ ds his rooms in the heav@@ ens , and has founded his va@@ ult on the ear@@ th ; he who calls for the waters of the sea , and po@@ urs them out on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; Yah@@ we@@ h is his name .
I will bring my people Israel back from cap@@ tivity , and they will rebuild the ru@@ ined cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat their fruit .
but don '@@ t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction . D@@ on '@@ t speak pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
the house of Jac@@ o@@ b will be a fire , the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble . they will bur@@ n among them , and dev@@ our them . there will not be any remaining to the house of E@@ sa@@ u . " indeed , Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , both man and animal , and let them cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
Yah@@ we@@ h God prepared a v@@ ine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a sha@@ de over his head , to deliver him from his dis@@ comfor@@ t . so Jon@@ ah was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad because of the v@@ ine .
all her id@@ ols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temp@@ le gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute has she gathered them , and to the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute shall they return . "
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets who lead my people as@@ tra@@ y ; for those who fe@@ ed their te@@ eth , they procla@@ im , " Peace ! " and who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for their m@@ ou@@ ths , they prepare war against him :
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not div@@ ine ; and the sun will go down on the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day will be black over them .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and peoples will stream to it .
yet was she carried away . she went into cap@@ tivity . her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her hon@@ or@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in cha@@ ins .
your guards are like the loc@@ ust@@ s , and your officials like the s@@ war@@ ms of loc@@ ust@@ s , which settle on the walls on a cold day , but when the sun appears , they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
yes , moreover , wine is t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous . a ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t stay at home , who en@@ lar@@ ges his desire as She@@ ol , and he is like death , and can '@@ t be satisfied , but ga@@ thers to himself all nations , and he@@ aps to himself all peoples .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which came to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , the son of C@@ us@@ hi , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in that day you will not be disappointed for all your do@@ ings , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me ; for then I will take away out of the mid@@ st of you your pro@@ u@@ dly ex@@ ulting ones , and you will no more be ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty in my hol@@ y mountain .
in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came by Hag@@ ga@@ i , the pro@@ phe@@ t , to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , saying ,
I called for a drought on the land , on the mountains , on the gra@@ in , on the new wine , on the oil , on that which the ground brings forth , on men , on li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and on all the la@@ bor of the hands . "
then Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , with all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , their God , and the words of Hag@@ ga@@ i , the pro@@ phe@@ t , as Yah@@ we@@ h , their God , had sent him ; and the people fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will overthrow the th@@ r@@ one of k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms . I will destroy the strength of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the nations . I will overthrow the char@@ i@@ ots , and those who ride in them . the hor@@ ses and their ri@@ ders will come down , everyone by the s@@ word of his brother .
on the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the ele@@ venth month , which is the month She@@ bat , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do , the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
" I had a vision in the night , and be@@ hold , a man ri@@ ding on a red hor@@ se , and he stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees that were in a rav@@ ine ; and behind him there were red , bro@@ wn , and white hor@@ ses .
then lifted I up my eyes , and saw , and be@@ hold , there were two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings . now they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k , and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket between ear@@ th and the sky .
" take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , where they have come from Bab@@ yl@@ on .
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the pri@@ ests , saying , ' When you fas@@ ted and mour@@ ned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these sev@@ enty years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " I have returned to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem . Jer@@ usalem shall be called ' The City of Tru@@ th ; ' and the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' The Holy Mountain . ' "
" I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back ; for I have mer@@ cy on them ; and they will be as though I had not cast them off : for I am Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and I will hear them .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .
he will pass through the sea of aff@@ li@@ ction , and will strike the waves in the sea , and all the dep@@ ths of the N@@ ile will d@@ ry up ; and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a will be brought down , and the scep@@ ter of Egypt will de@@ part .
for I will no more p@@ ity the inhabitants of the land , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " but , be@@ hold , I will deliver the men everyone into his neigh@@ bor 's hand , and into the hand of his king . they will strike the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them . "
then I said , " I will not fe@@ ed you . that which dies , let it die ; and that which is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let those who are left eat each other 's f@@ les@@ h . "
in that day , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " I will strike every hor@@ se with terror , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will strike every hor@@ se of the peoples with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
it will come to pass in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they will be remember@@ ed no more . I will also cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the spirit of imp@@ urity to pass out of the land .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
this will be the pla@@ gue with which Yah@@ we@@ h will strike all the peoples who have war@@ red against Jer@@ usalem : their f@@ les@@ h will consum@@ e away while they stand on their feet , and their eyes will consum@@ e away in their so@@ c@@ kets , and their ton@@ gue will consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neigh@@ bor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neigh@@ bor .
" be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he will prepare the way before me ; and the Lord , whom you seek , will su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to his temp@@ le ; and the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom you desire , be@@ hold , he comes ! " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus was re@@ ig@@ ning over Ju@@ de@@ a in the place of his father , Her@@ od , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Gal@@ il@@ ee ,
if your right hand causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should per@@ ish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
he said to them , " What man is there among you , who has one she@@ ep , and if this one falls into a p@@ it on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , won '@@ t he gra@@ b on to it , and lift it out ?

if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire .

they don '@@ t eat when they come from the market@@ place , unless they ba@@ the themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : w@@ ash@@ ings of c@@ ups , pit@@ chers , bronze vessels , and cou@@ ches . )
for he was teaching his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and when he is killed , on the third day he will rise again . "
if your fo@@ ot causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life la@@ me , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the fire that will never be qu@@ en@@ ch@@ ed@@ --
they came to Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ es@@ us entered into the temp@@ le , and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the money chan@@ gers , and the seats of those who sold the d@@ ov@@ es .
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
but when you see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not ( let the re@@ ader understand ) , then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains ,
he bought a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and taking him down , wo@@ und him in the lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rol@@ led a stone against the door of the tomb .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ de@@ a , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the pri@@ est@@ ly division of A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah . he had a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
it happened , when the an@@ gel@@ s went away from them into the sky , that the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , " Let 's go to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , now , and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
now it happened on the second Sab@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he was going through the gra@@ in fields . his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the heads of gra@@ in , and ate , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good , and the ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart brings out that which is ev@@ il , for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart , his m@@ outh speaks .
they are like children who sit in the market@@ place , and call one to another , saying , ' We pip@@ ed to you , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dance . we mour@@ ned , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t we@@ ep . '
now it happened on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his dis@@ cip@@ les , and he said to them , " Let 's go over to the other side of the lake . " so they launched out .
turning to the dis@@ cip@@ les , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my F@@ ather . no one knows who the Son is , except the F@@ ather , and who the F@@ ather is , except the Son , and he to who@@ mev@@ er the Son desi@@ res to reveal him . "
on the next day , when he depar@@ ted , he took out two den@@ ar@@ ii , and gave them to the host , and said to him , ' T@@ ake care of him . whatever you spend beyond that , I will repay you when I return . '
" which of you fa@@ thers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won '@@ t give him a sn@@ ake instead of a fish , will he ?
they will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . "
" it happened when he had come back again , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , that he comman@@ ded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by conducting business .
an ins@@ cri@@ ption was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to those who were sitting down ; likewise also of the fish as much as they desi@@ red .
on the next day , the multi@@ tude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , except the one in which his dis@@ cip@@ les had embar@@ ked , and that J@@ es@@ us h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t entered with his dis@@ cip@@ les into the boat , but his dis@@ cip@@ les had gone away alone .
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . J@@ es@@ us was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
J@@ es@@ us therefore answ@@ ered , " It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have di@@ pped it . " so when he had di@@ pped the piece of bread , he gave it to Ju@@ das , the son of Simon Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot .
you heard how I told you , ' I go away , and I come to you . ' if you lov@@ ed me , you would have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , because I said ' I am going to my F@@ ather ; ' for the F@@ ather is greater than I@@ .
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don '@@ t go away , the coun@@ sel@@ or won '@@ t come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
therefore J@@ es@@ us perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " D@@ o you inqu@@ ire among yo@@ ur@@ selves concerning this , that I said , ' A little while , and you won '@@ t see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ? '
a woman , when she gives birth , has sor@@ row , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remember the an@@ gu@@ ish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and said to them , " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we don '@@ t know where they have laid him ! "
when therefore it was evening , on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were locked where the dis@@ cip@@ les were assemb@@ led , for fear of the Jews , J@@ es@@ us came and stood in the mid@@ st , and said to them , " Peace be to you . "
therefore , being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up the Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ,
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , un@@ settling your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , ' You must be circum@@ c@@ ised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no comman@@ d@@ ment ;
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignor@@ ance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to d@@ well on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , having determined appointed se@@ as@@ ons , and the boundaries of their d@@ wel@@ lings ,
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by the man whom he has or@@ da@@ ined ; of which he has given assur@@ ance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was has@@ tening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jer@@ usalem on the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's compan@@ ions , depar@@ ted , and came to Ca@@ es@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
when a great argument ar@@ ose , the comman@@ ding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so on the next day , when Agri@@ p@@ pa and Bern@@ ice had come with great pom@@ p , and they had entered into the place of hearing with the comman@@ ding officers and principal men of the city , at the command of F@@ es@@ tus , Paul was brought in .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a ser@@ vant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every m@@ outh may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he received the sign of circum@@ c@@ ision , a se@@ al of the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the faith which he had while he was in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that he might be the father of all those who believe , though they might be in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , that righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness might also be accounted to them .
without being weak@@ ened in faith , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ ah 's w@@ om@@ b .
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree , and were graf@@ ted contrary to nature into a good olive tree , how much more will these , which are the natural branches , be graf@@ ted into their own olive tree ?
he who obser@@ ves the day , obser@@ ves it to the Lord ; and he who does not observe the day , to the Lord he does not observe it . he who e@@ ats , e@@ ats to the Lord , for he gives God thanks . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , to the Lord he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat , and gives God thanks .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perf@@ ected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
what then is my reward ? that , when I pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , I may present the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Go@@ od News .
but if anyone says to you , " This was offered to id@@ ols , " don '@@ t eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of con@@ science . for " the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and all its ful@@ l@@ ness . "
love never fails . but where there are pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies , they will be done away with . where there are various languages , they will ce@@ ase . where there is knowledge , it will be done away with .
now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y . for he is greater who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interpre@@ ts , that the assembly may be built up .
and I wrote this very thing to you , so that , when I came , I wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy would be shared by all of you .
while we don '@@ t look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al , but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for if in anything I have bo@@ asted to him on your behalf , I was not disappointed . but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our g@@ lor@@ ying also which I made before Tit@@ us was found to be truth .
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face ? if anyone tru@@ sts in himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him consider this again with himself , that , even as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , so also we are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they bo@@ ast , they may be found even as we .
for if I would desire to bo@@ ast , I will not be fo@@ ol@@ ish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or he@@ ars from me .
by reason of the exceeding gre@@ at@@ ness of the reve@@ lations , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , a mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to tor@@ ment me , that I should not be ex@@ al@@ ted exc@@ es@@ sively .
until we all at@@ tain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full grown man , to the measure of the stat@@ ure of the ful@@ l@@ ness of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
from whom all the body , being f@@ it@@ ted and k@@ n@@ it together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
for our wrestling is not against f@@ les@@ h and blood , but against the princip@@ alities , against the powers , against the world 's rul@@ ers of the d@@ ark@@ ness of this age , and against the spir@@ itual forces of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the heav@@ en@@ ly places .
finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are hon@@ or@@ able , whatever things are just , whatever things are p@@ ure , whatever things are lov@@ ely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
and that our Go@@ od News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spiri@@ t , and with much assur@@ ance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that you withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother who walk@@ s in rebel@@ lion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
they indeed of the sons of L@@ evi who receive the pri@@ est 's office have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Ab@@ ra@@ ham ,
( for they indeed have been made pri@@ ests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , " The Lord s@@ wor@@ e and will not change his mind , ' You are a pri@@ est fore@@ ver , according to the order of Mel@@ chi@@ zede@@ k . ' "
" for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel . after those days , " says the Lord ; " I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
" this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with them : ' after those days , ' says the Lord , ' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; ' " then he says ,
D@@ on '@@ t speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
if you are ins@@ ulted for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , you are b@@ les@@ sed ; because the Spiri@@ t of gl@@ ory and of God rests on you . on their part he is b@@ las@@ phe@@ med , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
for if , after they have escaped the def@@ il@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ ior J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
they went out from us , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t belong to us ; for if they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . but they left , that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
and every spirit who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t conf@@ ess that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist has come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
if a man says , " I love God , " and ha@@ tes his brother , he is a li@@ ar ; for he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother whom he has seen , how can he love God whom he has not seen ?
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eter@@ nal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write : " he who is hol@@ y , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no one can shut , and who sh@@ u@@ ts and no one opens , says these things :
be@@ hold , I give of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but lie . be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before your feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed you .
I saw in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four living cre@@ atures , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , a lam@@ b standing , as though it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns , and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God , sent out into all the ear@@ th .
the first so@@ unded , and there followed ha@@ il and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the ear@@ th . one third of the ear@@ th was bur@@ n@@ t up , and one third of the trees were bur@@ n@@ t up , and all green gr@@ ass was bur@@ n@@ t up .
I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh . when I had e@@ aten it , my st@@ om@@ ach was made bitter .
the great dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , he who is called the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , the dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were thrown down with him .
two w@@ ings of the great e@@ ag@@ le were given to the woman , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to her place , so that she might be no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the s@@ word , he must be killed . here is the en@@ dur@@ ance and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
it was given to him to give bre@@ ath to it , to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause as many as wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the be@@ ast to be killed .
I saw , and be@@ hold , the lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his F@@ ather , written on their fore@@ heads .
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
the light of a lam@@ p will sh@@ ine no more at all in you . the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de will be heard no more at all in you ; for your mer@@ chan@@ ts were the pr@@ inces of the ear@@ th ; for with your sor@@ cer@@ y all the nations were dec@@ e@@ ived .
I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the th@@ r@@ one , and they opened books . another book was opened , which is the book of life . the dead were jud@@ ged out of the things which were written in the books , according to their works .
